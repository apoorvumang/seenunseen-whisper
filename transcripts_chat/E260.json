        "message": "There are terms we take for granted that perhaps we need to look at closely. One of them is art. What is art? How do we define it? Can art only be done by those who have been deemed by elites and academics to be artists? Or can anyone do art? Is a five year old kid drawing an upside down house and a pink moon creating art? As a guide to thinking about this, I recommend an excellent book by Ernst Gombrich, The Story of Art, which begins with these words, quote, There really is no such thing as art. There are only artists. Once these were men who took colored earth and roughed out the forms of a bison on the walls of a cave. Today they buy their paints and design posters for the underground. They did many things in between. There is no harm in calling all these activities art, as long as we keep in mind that such a word may mean very different things in different times and places. And as long as we realize that art with a capital A has no existence. For art with a capital A has come to be something of a bogey and a fetish. You may crush an artist by telling him that what he has just done may be quite good in its own way, only it is not art. And you may confound anyone enjoying a picture by declaring that what he liked in it was not the art, but something different. Stop quote. I agree with Gombrich. And I'm glad that we are finally achieving a world in which a small group of elite gatekeepers and tastemakers don't get to decide what is art. To hell with them. We don't need them. We can all be artists if we want."

I first noticed Nishant when he put up these time-lapse videos of him sketching people in outdoor locations. Later, I realized that's what is known as urban sketching. Then Nishant signed up for my course, The Art of Clear Writing. And along with other participants in the course, we have since had many lively discussions on what constitutes art and what is this thing called the creator economy. Nishant thinks about this new world in counterintuitive ways that are filled with clarity. He does unconventional things, but he's thought them through and he's clear about why he's doing them. After doing my course, he also started a long form conversation podcast where he speaks to artists like himself. And he began an excellent newsletter where he writes about his journey, thinking aloud in a sense for all of us. He lives in Vancouver, but he happened to be in India in November. So I said, Hey, if you're up for an episode, come to Mumbai. I was kind of kidding, but he flew down just for this recording. We had so much to talk about that we crossed five hours and felt we could have spoken for another five. I love this conversation. But before you begin listening to it, let's take a quick commercial break. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free. Once you sign up, each new installment that I write will land up in your email inbox. You don't need to go anywhere. So subscribe now for free. The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you. Nishant, welcome to the scene and the unseen."

Well, you know, guests just chill and they just kind of chat about stuff. But since you are so terrified, let me ask you a sort of unconventional question, which is that if say Da Vinci or Rembrandt were alive today, would they do what they were doing? Would their art be what it was then? Or would they go off into different directions?"

        "message": "That's a really good question. Because what often happens I feel is that when people look back at the art of people they admire, they sort of transpose them to the current moment doing that same thing. So somebody looks at Rembrandt and decides they want to be a fine artist. But Rembrandt was a fine artist of his time and they are trying to be a fine artist in the 21st century using the same tools almost. That's a strange decision in my in my opinion. So I don't know much about the background of these people and how they came to be artists, whether they went through formal education, but they were alive in a time of great discovery. And they were leaders of various movements, artistic visions and ideas. So how I would like to think of it is that they would be using all the technologies they could because that's what they did. Then people used technologies like camera obscura as soon as those were available to them too much criticism, that this is not real art. And a lot of great artists have faced this criticism in their time that what they are doing is not real art. And it is only in retrospect centuries later that we are looking at their work and now giving it the title of real art and trying to imitate that in the same way today. So I feel like somebody like Da Vinci for sure would have a TikTok channel. And you would see you would see NFTs from a number of them and all kinds of because these are people excited by the future. So I had a guest in on my podcast sometime back and we were talking about we were talking about the things that people make as subjects. So I speak to urban sketches on my podcast. And one of my consistent questions to them comes from the fact that urban sketches come from a very diverse set of backgrounds. Anybody is an urban sketcher, if they simply take a sketchbook, and they walk around that town and they draw. So I'm always curious to know, what is it that makes you draw? What about your city do you look at that gets you interested? So what are the subjects that excite you? And why? And this is something I tried to find out through these conversations I have, he broached the subject of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. And the idea was that these guys painted landscapes and rural landscapes and windmills and things like this, we might look at that. And inculcate a romantic notion of pastoral rural life and think that this is what we should do. Real artists paint windmills and old buildings and that's what we should do. But windmills were the latest technology of Rembrandt's time. The farming scenes that Van Gogh was painting were happening outside his home. This was modern life for him. So somebody like Rembrandt painting windmills is like someone like me going to Silicon Valley and making a drawing of Googleplex, or finding Elon Musk and drawing a portrait of Elon Musk and not of some other thing which is informed by an aesthetic that is two centuries or three centuries old. So it's kind of difficult to think about what someone would precisely do. But the easier route is to think about the motivations that they had in the time that they were alive, and how those motivations can be the same for us today in the time that"

        "message": "we are alive. That's a great point. So I have a couple of related thoughts. I'll just voice them and tell me what you feel about them. And thought number one is this, that the population of Warsaw today is probably more than all of Europe at the time Da Vinci was alive. And therefore, just looking at it in a crude statistical way, you would assume that the distribution of artistic talent is as much if not even better. And I say better because you have much more exposure to art, you have that entire body of centuries of art, which you can look back on and learn from, if not consciously, then at least sort of imbibe it without realizing. And also we have far better technology available to us. So my assumption would be that in a modern times, with so many more people, which by the way, is a bloody good thing. Population is not a problem. It's a greater strength that in these modern times, with so many more people, with so much better technology, with so much better exposure to art, my assumption would simply be that we should get art of a much higher quality than in days past. And I think this is happening, but I think it is happening in ways that are unseen by us. I think that what is most likely happening is that we are so inundated by all kinds of music and sound and visuals and all of that, that a lot of stuff just falls by the wayside, that there is a great danger today to be lost and perhaps lost forever. Like I remember there was this thread on Twitter a while back, which I think Roshan Abbas had pointed me to, which was about Billy Joel, that when Billy Joel's Piano Man came out, it sank basically, and the record label was just not going to print anymore. And it was a done thing and he wasn't going to do any more records and that's it, the guy was over. Till one random enthusiast decided that no, this is such an amazing album, it has to be heard. And he himself took it around to all the radio stations saying that please play this, which in the early 70s was how you made a mark by being played at a radio station. And finally, he made the deal with the RJ of a big radio station that there was some kind of quid pro quo, but basically, I'll give you something that you want if you kind of play this and that guy played it. And you know, what happened, happened. And similarly, I remember this old video by Rick Beato, the music YouTuber, where he talks about how during his lifetime, Bach was unknown. You know, he was a marginal figure. And then in the decades after his death, you had this kind of Bach Renaissance and today he's a great figure he is. And the truth is that number one, there are possibly many people like that today we don't recognize, but future generations might. But also that there is a danger that a lot of people are A, getting lost, and B, that we aren't adequately appreciative of the quality of art out there that we're looking at past centuries. And of course, we should admire pioneers of the past, like Da Vinci and Rembrandt for everything they did and everything they stood for. But we are probably closing our eyes to a lot of incredible art that is already out there. And some of us may even be sort of looking down on it with this knobbish thing, that this is not on the canvas, therefore it is not art. Looking down on new media, like for example, TikTok, if there is a Da Vinci on TikTok today, obviously, he's not being regarded as a Da Vinci of TikTok, which is sad."

        "time": "00:11:02.400",
        "message": "Well, the question of regarded implies who is doing the regarding. So this is the great liberation of today, right? Like, when we think of Da Vinci's time, or we think even 50, 60 years back, let's say, there is a certain group of people who have the privilege to be able to regard and then give value to someone's art. They own galleries, or they own auction houses, and they get to decide, okay, art and okay now, and therefore you become an artist. So these people come through the cracks, music industry, all even film industry, everything, because of those gatekeepers. And gatekeepers is a pejorative term, but they were, they would see themselves as curators, they are the ones preserving and proliferating a movement. So it is a very noble job to do none very true. But when you say something like say, Da Vinci today, on TikTok, today's Da Vinci not being regarded, I would counter that with saying that there is no need for them to be regarded. Someone like him on and there are hundreds like him on TikTok. And the beauty of today's time is that we can find each of those hundreds of people. When I think of the 1600s and 1700s, I think of how many people perhaps died remaining unknown their whole lives, their paintings lost to us because the geographic location of where they lived, made getting access to a gallery difficult, made getting access to an elite patron difficult. If you don't have an elite patron, your paintings don't last 200 years later for them to be seen, and then to be discovered again further and put in museums and you to become a name. So there are so many geniuses who simply by not having the right set of circumstances around their work could not become big names. And today, all of those things have been shattered in lots of different ways. Today, it is possible for an artist to be known and to earn the value of their work in their time. And you don't need to have a situation like Vincent van Gogh and somebody being appreciated after their death, somebody committing suicide out of the lack of appreciation for their work. So when we talk about this thing of things getting drowned, so I always think about music because I have grown around good music. Music has been a very deep part of my life always. And I have sort of gone backwards in time in my appreciation of music. I started off when I was a young teenager, I wanted the music of my time, Green Day was big for me, Bryan Adams was big for me. And every year since then, I would go another decade back. And until I came to settle on even music from the 20s and 30s, and like jazz and old blues, and that became my music. And how I think of it is that somebody might look at my choice of music and say, you don't even listen to pop music. I have never heard a Taylor Swift song, for example, I wouldn't be able to tell her voice apart from some of the other big pop stars of today. What does that mean? Does that mean should I feel that the kind of music I like is being drowned out by the pop music of today? This again implies that there is one pyramid to climb, and that you have to be the top of this pyramid, otherwise you are nothing. And this has been true for centuries, that there is one pyramid or two pyramids, you have to be top of the pops, or you are nothing. The doors get on this TV show, and they get to perform live or they are nothing. But that's not the case today, right? Like you can exist within your own ecosystems, all of these musical genres have their own ecosystems within which they thrive. Jazz is alive today, there is more incredible jazz today than there was in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s. This year has the most jazz. This year has more people appreciating Bach than ever before in history. This year has more people appreciating Da Vinci than ever before in history. So our notions of what is being drowned out is, I feel like it is a function of this old idea that there is one pyramid. And if you are not on the top of that one pyramid, which is incidentally driven by corporations who want to sell certain things, and who want to prop up certain musicians, I answer the pop music question by simply saying pop music is one thin layer on top of what is music. All the music of the whole world, all the centuries of it is accessible to me today. Why does it matter that I didn't listen to an album that came out in 2021? What makes it special compared to an album that came out in 1970 that I also haven't heard that I might be curious about? Because now I am in my world of discovery, my ecosystem, through which I go to YouTube to access some of it. I go to Instagram to access my art. I go to another place to access videos and music and things. Spotify tells me about music from the 30s and 40s, just as it tells me about music from 2021. So these races, almost, of who is on top is increasingly irrelevant. It has helped me to think like this as an artist myself, to consider these things as relevant, because it has helped me to do more work. And it has helped me to make peace as a creator, this feeling that you are being drowned out by other things, the understanding that we are not in a single race anymore, as listeners, as readers, and as writers and"

And there's another aspect of this, which is, at one level, of course, you're lucky enough to get noticed. So you're noticed. But at another level, if you're not noticed, what is also happening is you're not iterating, you're not improving your art, you're not getting better and better.

Neither had I till yesterday. We are recording this in 23rd November, right? Episode will sort of broadcast later. So Puneet Superstar is this guy who's apparently very big on TikTok and Instagram and all that. And there was a time where he was putting out guess how many videos in a day? It's obviously a high number, because I'm asking you but guess. Three, four? No, keep guessing. Eight? There was a day he put out 500 videos. Five? He was just sitting with his phone, turning it on himself, record clip after clip, put it up, right? Massive volume. He's made more than one and a half lakh videos. He said in his early days, it was disheartening, because he was getting three, four likes per video. And his family was like, what are you doing, son? In fact, even one uncle, like he had called himself, I forget the exact term for it, but basically useless, unemployed, the Hindi for it. And his uncle had told him, what are you doing? Why don't you see this thing called TikTok? Why don't you make videos? So he started making videos. And after a week, his uncle was what the fuck are you doing? You know, what is this? That you're just putting three likes, two likes per video, probably his own likes, but he continues. And eventually a video goes viral, which in his terms is like 1500 views. And then he stays stable at that level. And then he hits another level. And today, apparently, people pay him to record personalized birthday messages for him. So in a day, he'll do like 30 personalized birthday messages. And the manner of that, and again, I've seen him speaking about this, I haven't even seen any of those videos, I'm entering a rabbit hole of Puneet superstar soon. But apparently, what he does is he'll take a cake, he'll take a separate cake for each guy. And he'll wish the guy and smash it on his face. So he speaks about the process of then wiping off all of the previous cake and before he smashes the next cake, 500 cakes a day, not 500 cakes a day, it must be less than that 15-20 cakes for whoever he wishes happy birthday to. If they make special requests, he'll give them more. So one guy apparently said, don't do it with cake, do it with chowmein. And I'll give you 500 bucks more. So then"

There is a market for this kind of thing, you know, what's happening is that not only are you creating video content, but you're inviting your viewership to contribute to the creation. Yeah, you are giving them a reason to talk to you to reply to you. Maybe if he has a live stream, then they can tell him something to do right then. So a lot of creative technology, and it's a little controversial to say, but a lot of creative technology and online individual creator technology benefits from the pornography industry. And that has given us handicaps that has given us independent micro payments that has given us all these platforms that Twitch and everything thrives upon. Like the reason why video streams are possible today is because the there was a market in porn for it. I mean, a lot of the intimate creator economy is kind of driven by only fans as well. So exactly. And only fans works on this platform. And it has like it's taken huge leaps since the pandemic because so many people lost conventional income streams of live streaming things. Well, there are different degrees of how intimate and how explicit things get. But the fundamental concept of somebody feeling like they matter, that somebody that they watch on video is responding to them in a sense, and the value that that has, what's happening now is there is a phase when ideas are skeuomorphic, not only in format, but even in the mentality of what is the idea, what is the product, a drawing is a drawing that I sell physically. Otherwise, it is a drawing that somebody sees digitally. But the idea that the making of the drawing could be the product. If I live stream a drawing, then people would pay money just to watch me draw. And people might pay money simply because I live in a part of the world that they can never otherwise access and actually watch over my shoulder. So the technology is making possible this interaction between us. And therefore it has value because it is otherwise impossible. So this is as things evolve, as we get more into it, you get these very digital native ideas of what is a product and what has value. And it's super interesting. Like young people are better positioned to do this because they are digital natives. And I think it's a fan like all creatives, all creators should look at what the youngest person they can find is doing and apply their creative ideas to making that work in their"

Like, of course, 12 years ago, or more than a decade ago, Kevin Kelly wrote this great essay 1000 fans. And just to kind of summarize for my listeners Kelly's thrust there was that artists no longer need to scale like earlier, if you were a musician, you'd need to be, you know, make it to the top people at the top make a lot of money, not so much for everybody else. But his point was in the new age artists will no longer need to scale. If you just find 1000 true fans who are say paying you $100 a year, that's $100,000 a year, that's that's extremely healthy. And you can get by on that. And something that both you and I have seen where it's no longer so important to get into the mainstream, even if there is a mainstream at all, which is why what you said about the da Vinci of tick tock, not needing that kind of large audience is absolutely true. He's got 1000 or more likely 100,000 true fans. And that's perfectly fine. And thinking aloud, it also strikes me that that is not only a fantastic shift from a creator's point of view. It's also a very interesting shift from the consumer's point of view, like much as you and I are creators, we're also consumers. And a lot of the stuff that I consume is stuff that I feel an intimate connection with, like there will be podcasts I listen to like Russ Roberts doing his thing, or, you know, Tyler Cowen show, or hardcore history, which is so incredible, where it's not like you're listening to something broadcast to you, but you actually witnessed you're sitting with a couple of friends, people often say this about my show, that I felt I was sitting on a sofa and you and your guests are just sitting and talking and I'm just listening in, which is incredible because it fosters a sense of intimacy. Like earlier, your artists were at a plane removed from you, you know, like Amitabh Bachchan had temples made for him. So they were at a plane removed, they are larger than life. Today, you are so much smaller than that you are life itself, you're right there, you're next to the guy, you when you if you accidentally meet him, you feel like you actually know the person which is what many, you know, listeners of the podcast sometimes tell me, except that they wonder why am I speaking like a retard at half the speed because they listen at double speed. So that apart, what is your sense of this of the kind of art you consume and the liberation that this realization must have"

        "message": "brought you? Yeah, so I grew up in the 90s. And I was 10 years old when I first went on the internet with the dial up connection and everything. And instantly this opened up a world like immediately there was the idea that you can have online friendships, there were these chat rooms and this idea that you can talk to somebody. So you can get something from somebody that you've never met. And there was no money in these ideas initially. So I look a little nostalgically back on those times, because what that meant was, because there is no idea of it being financially feasible or financially profitable. Everything was sincere. Only somebody who really, really cared about a subject wrote about a subject there was no incentive to have disinformation, for example, because why what will how will it help? There's no political angle to it, there's no money to be made. So somebody writing about history, the only reason they would do it is because they honestly actually love this subject, or politics or art or whatever. So there was this native sort of niceness about the internet in its early form in that sense. So what I have often felt is that I have learned so many things from being on the internet. And what that has done to me as a consumer of the written word of music of videos, all art and all these things, is that it has empowered me in so many ways, I would always draw when I was young. But I used to think that I'm not good at it, because I can't draw from imagination. I was always even when I was super young, very good at looking at something and drawing. And I used to think that that is not art. This is copying. I can't draw I can copy. So I would dismiss my abilities like this and think he moved in India. But so from watching people do this thing and watching people put out content, which is not that simple idea of this is art, you know, that singular definition art means a finished painting with all this level of detail with all this like huge canvas with all these tools and supplies that I will never own like oil paints and big brushes. So I can't make art. But then I saw this webcomic, I saw xkcd. And xkcd is this webcomic with just lines and just stick figures. And it made me feel things it made me feel think about ideas, it made me think about love and math and science, which are the various subjects that that webcomic is about. And I could see that it's instantly connecting so easily with me and I am geographically so far away from this person's world. And so it has to be similarly connecting with so many 1000s of people. And it's just stick figures. And that was the first time that I distinctly remember that a piece of content on the internet gave me permission. And this idea of permission is very dear to my life, because I feel like I have always been a contrarian who does not seek permission. But even that idea is on the surface, like deep inside, I feel all of us need permission from various forces in our life to do anything. And we seek it from peers, we seek it from people who inspire us, let me do something, tell me I can do something, show me how I can also do something. I saw the stick figure comic and I told myself, you know, I don't know how to draw, but I can also make a webcomic. And I started to make a webcomic. And I started to make a webcomic just like xkcd. I would talk about my life though. But just like him, I would draw three times a week and publish it. And it became a thing. And I got into this idea that I can put my drawings on the internet, which are not very good. I don't know how to draw really. But I can be funny about it. Because I've always been putting writing on the internet. I'd been a blogger for about five years before then. And this is another thing that I took permission on. There was a Telegraph article Telegraph in Calcutta, with the title of weblogs, this new thing that has happened. And there is a blogosphere on the internet. And that reading that gave me the permission to put my writing online. Hey, I don't need to be any blight and or I don't need to be Arthur Conan Doyle, I can just write and I get to hit a publish button. What an empowering feeling that I get to do that. Who am I, I get to do it. I started a weblog, a blog. And I started blogging religiously. And five years later, I started a webcomic. And I had the right to do that somebody gave me the permission to do that. And this is what content on the internet is to me. No matter what I consume, no matter what someone else consumes, whether you enjoy it or not, it gives you this, it empowers you, you get to appreciate it. And you know that your appreciation has value to that person who is seeking it from you. Even the idea that I have the right to appreciate something, who am I to appreciate something who am I to say that this person is an artist, don't gallery owners get to decide those things. But now on the internet, I get to decide that my like button matters. If I upload a video on YouTube, that person becomes a more consistent YouTuber, I help to do that. So it is empowerment on all ends of the spectrum handed out to every average internet user. It's been just"

        "message": "amazing for me the last 15 years of doing this, the point to make about who is an artist and this permission that we need is so true, like something that I discussed on an episode I recorded recently, though I don't know whether it will release before or after this one probably before and I would have said it is with Annapurna Garimela, the art historian and we were kind of discussing how, you know, a lot of fine art through the ages, the problem that I have with it and by fine art, I mean, you know, painted canvases and all of that is that it's restricted to the elites, you know, you have a bunch of elite gatekeepers at a particular point in time, who may be in the throes of particular ideologies or beliefs or politics or whatever, they decide what is good and what is not they decide who is an artist and who is not they create this distinction between art is this and the rest is craft or whatever. And you know, I've actually had artists, fine artists here in India talking to me about, you know, referring to something a famous critic wrote about their work saying that I don't know, none of that was in my head when I made it. But he's seen something that's not there. And and to kind of, you know, get past that elitism to make those gatekeepers irrelevant is pretty fantastic to me. And just speaking of forms, like I remember, like I was one of the early bloggers here. And when I started blogging, the great part of it was that, like I was a mainstream journalist, but it freed me from the necessity of following the news cycle that you have to write about what is newsworthy. It freed me from dictates of style, what the house style in a place might be, so I could find my own voice. And most of all, it freed me from formats, right, you know, the 800 word article, and we used to think in fixed formats, like a writer would think that an article has to be 800 words, a book is 100,000 filmmakers would think that all Hollywood film is, you know, 190 minutes or a Bollywood film is three hours, and you're stuck to those formats. And today, over time, and even it took even me a while to realize this, even after I had blogged a lot and all of that, that today, that thinking is outdated. Like you said, skeuomorphic, and skeuomorphic, by the way, is a design term. And what it means is that when you're working in a new format, to make it familiar to people who've used the old format, you reproduce some of those motifs, even though you don't have to. So for example, I think Apple had an eReader once, and they made it look like a bookshelf, you know,"

        "message": "if you think about I think the easiest example of skeuomorphic stuff is icons that we use. So the use of the classical staff notation as the music icon, who recognizes that like most people today don't, but that instinctively means music to us. And we know what's being talked about, or even the folder icon on the desktop. And so in interesting observation on that, like I was just reading this article about how somebody was talking about college professors were speaking to design students about this idea of just a file organization. And the new students have no concept of it. They don't understand what you mean by C drive, then doing a docs folder, then another folder, because the way we use our phone, the way we use these devices like iPad and things like tablets and things. So the idea of organizing information in folders and directories with references is an older idea. And the idea today is that everything is sort of like a big bag. I put it in and when I need it, there's a find function that finds it for me. Why should I know where exactly what does it mean? What does it matter where exactly it is located and cataloging something like that is already a skeuomorphic idea."

So that's kind of interesting. Let's now go back to where I normally start my episodes by talking about somebody's personal life. Like you are a Marwari from Calcutta who did engineering and build race cars. So tell me a little bit about your journey. Specifically, you mentioned you grew up in the 90s, presumably in Calcutta and all of that. Tell me what were those years like what was growing up in those years like what was Calcutta like? What did you want to be as a kid?"

        "message": "Yeah, sure. So for the longest time I can remember, I wanted to be a writer. This is how I talk about it now that I'm a very deliberate writer. And I'm a very accidental artist. Becoming an artist was never part of the plan until it sort of happened one day. And it took me another year after that to accept that label. But so I grew up in Calcutta, and I was a voracious reader, like any wannabe writer is to begin. And I would read everything like I read books, and I read dictionaries, and I read encyclopedias, and I would read instruction manuals, just if there is something with words on it, I will read it. And I will just keep reading. My parents were very hands off, like they let me do things they let my brother and I play however we wanted and do whatever we wanted. We didn't have many rules set on us. One thing interesting about my life growing up in the 90s, because I am part of the generation that had the big push towards engineering, right? So IITs became a thing IIT-JEE and AIEEE and all these competitive exams and preparing for them became a thing, very, very firmly a thing for us. And I in my high school years was the only person I knew who did not have any tuitions. So I never took any tuitions for science studies. And I gave all these entrance exams. And I gave all these entrance exams simply because that's what's done like this idea of what do you want to do? I don't think it was ever put to me. It was I maybe it's not something that quite occurred to my parents as that kind of open world in which you just become whatever you want. And it was just taken for it was implicit that you're good at science. So you will become an engineer. And I've always been that way that I'm a very curious person. I like to know how things work. I'm always I always try to figure things out. And I love learning. I just really love learning things. So I pay I'm the guy who sits in the back row, but pays attention in class. I'm the guy who sits in the back row but takes notes. So like I have diligent neat notes of all my classes. Why do you sit in the back row? Just because I don't want to sit in the front row. I will not be the kind of guy who sits in the front row. Okay, so there is a bit of the rebel. But I just I love learning things like even in my college years when I was a very, very anti-authoritarian, you know, anti-establishmentarian, contrarian rebel kind of person, I still took diligent notes in class because I just loved thermodynamics. And I loved the mechanical design and learning all these things. It was just so much cool stuff. I always wanted to know it in my in when I was in class eight, my English literature professor stood me up in class and said, Nishant, you are the most cynical person I have ever met in my life. And I thought that was the greatest compliment someone could give me. Because for all my these young years, I used to think that the only weapon or armor and it's sort of the same thing at that age I had was my wit. I loved words and I loved what words could do, how you could disarm someone or cut through them with sharp words. And I cultivated sharp words, nice sentences, comebacks. I had all of those things because I always felt like an outsider. So I was in very posh school of Calcutta. I was in La Martiniere for boys. And I'm I wasn't the in crowd of that school as I saw it then. And as I see now, looking back at it, I'll tell you an incident from it was really funny. And I recently refreshed this incident in my mind, which sort of told me about my place in this world that I was in in school, and I didn't realize how profound it is. So when I was in class six and seven, backstreet boys were a big deal. And backstreet boys are a big deal. So spiked hair was a big deal. Everybody had spiked hair. And I had no idea how this works. But I had classmates who used to come with shiny, spiky hair, like shining, glistening and just staying there. And I asked this classmate of mine how how this works, like what what are you doing to your hair? And he just said, it's just water. I just put water and then I come and I used to live an hour away from school, I would take this matador bus, which would take a bunch of us students at 7am and 8am drop us off at school. It was hot. And it was it was a long journey. And I would wet my hair just before leaving home and not dry it off and then go into this bus and hope that it was like obviously it did not stay this way by them in Calcutta. It did not stay this way by the time I reach school and those hairstyles never worked for me. And all those years it never occurred to me that he was putting gel on his hair. And not only was he putting gel on his hair, he was living he was getting into an air conditioned car, and then coming to school and getting dropped off. And I was taking a bus and all the air from outside and all the dust and everything was and it never occurred to me that there was this huge difference. And I kept feeling like I am not good enough. The privilege of gelled hair. Yeah, like I'm not cool enough for this. And the way that I can be cool, what what is the armor that I can get? How can I feel good about myself in this environment in which I feel inadequate? And that was words that was being smart and being intelligent. So I love these authors who made me feel this way. Like I love the twist of phrase that PG Woodhouse would bring into a book. I love the kind of intelligent plotting that Agatha Christie would do in her novels. And I would be like, yeah, if I can craft a novel like that, then somebody would read me and be like, yeah, this guy's got it. So I wanted to be those things. And I grew up like that. And I thought I wanted to be a writer. But it never occurred to me that you can become a writer until I started blogging. Even then it didn't occur to me that you can become a paid writer just by wanting to be so like, you can just you can just do it. And then you can keep doing it. And then it'll it'll work like it never occurred to me. So what do you do for studies? And my parents had engineering because I was good at science. And that's what you do. If you're good at science, I got really high marks and things like that. I was quite self destructive with all my competitive exams, I forgot to send in the papers for my comet K, which is the entrance exam for Karnataka colleges. And the day that your admit card is supposed to come, I opened my drawer to find that the check is still in my drawer, I haven't posted it, I reached my AIEEE exam one hour after it had already started, because I read the starting time wrong. So I did all kinds of terrible things. And I got into only Manipal, where I went for engineering. I did pretty well, I really enjoyed it. I got this opportunity in second year, to be part of this new group, which was making a race car. And this is, it's not Formula One, but it's called Formula Student. So it's the college student edition of Formula One. Formula One basically means that it's a race car competition with certain rules around it. So there are rules of design, there are restrictions on engine size, and all these various restrictions that Formula One keeps updating. And if you stick to these restrictions, then you're a Formula One car. And Formula Student similarly has its own set of rules. And universities all over the world do this, but no Indian university was doing it at that time. And we were nobody's if you're not even an IIT. I think IIT was doing it at that time, but not very well. And we'd like it was quite audacious for us to do this. And in fact, our teachers, my own teachers in mechanical engineering, told me, what's this? Why are you wasting your time? Just get your degree, get a job, go by you, what are you doing? They wouldn't give us attendance. Like, if we had to take time off from class to do some work, we wouldn't get attendance, like we had to stick to everything. And then on top of that, do this, which is a super non supportive framework, and it was very difficult. But we really wanted to do it. And I just got a kick out of learning things and being able to do things. And I was part of it. And we went to we raced that car in 2008. We went, we were the only Indian team in a group of like 60 universities from around the world. In Italy, we went to the Ferrari racetrack in Fiorano. It's the name of the racetrack is Fiorano racetrack. And we were there in this town called Maranello in in rural Italy. And we raced our car there. The next year, we went to Silverstone, which is where the British Grand Prix happens. We had another car there. And that sort of liberated me from the restrictions of what the education system was like. Because I was deeply disappointed when I first got to university. And I could sense that we're just faking it here. They are pretending to teach, I pretend to learn. And then I say some things at a job interview. And that guy pretends to get it. And maybe he gives me a job. Like there's no real thing happening here. I really have questions. And they don't want to answer because why are you asking these questions? These questions are pointless, they won't come in the paper. What am I doing? Is this an education? And this jadedness really set in around authority figures around around the thing, the hoops that I have to pass. So I was angry at my parents for a little bit. I used to be like, you know, you asked me to be an engineer, but do you know what it is to be an engineer? How did you decide that you want me to be an engineer? Does it matter if I was a mechanical engineer or a chemical engineer or a computer science engineer? It clearly it wouldn't have mattered to them if I had gotten computer science engineering. Why not? It's a completely different field. The skill set is completely different. And then that had me thinking about what does it take to be a computer science engineer in India, to be a computer science engineer in India, because that is the top field, you have to be really, really good at organic chemistry. Does that make any sense at all? You have to know nothing about computer science, you don't have to know how to write even a single line of code to get a computer science engineering seat in it, whatever the top ideas, you need to be really good at organic chemistry, though, because that's one third of the paper that you have to cross and I hated chemistry. So in my particular gripe against organic chemistry is this that why should I have to learn this? Maybe I can still be an engineer who doesn't know anything about chemistry. And lucky for me that I ended up in mechanical engineering and I had nothing to do with those things. Mechanical engineering was perfectly suited to me because it perfectly vibed with my way of learning. And it's completely accidental that I got it. It's so wrong that it had to happen this way. But this is how I learn. I have to internalize these ideas that I read about. The reason why I take notes is because this is how I learn. I don't do the tuitions. I don't have three hours every evening with lecturers and teachers after class. And I'm lazy. I don't like to study. So how do I learn? At the first time, I take notes while I'm in class. And that process of taking notes is your first layer of teaching yourself and then you revise those things and then you get a second layer of understanding. So I stuck with that through college, I would take notes. And mechanical engineering is suited to that because mechanical engineering is about imbibing these ideas. And once you sort of intuitively understand how things work, how thermodynamics goes, how designs structures work, how loads fall, and you can you can sort of visualize all of these things. And electrical engineering and all these things felt alien to me because I couldn't visualize these circuits in my mind, at least. And so it was complete happenstance that I happened to become a mechanical engineer, and that it worked with the way that I the ways that my curiosity worked, and that I got this chance to make a race car. And because I got this chance to make a race car, we went to Europe a couple of times with these race cars, and we spoke to students from other universities. And I found out that in other countries, people just do what they want to do this alien bizarre concept that you study what you wanted to study, you have a curiosity and you take it. And nobody tells you that you don't deserve to study here, or that you don't have to prove that you deserve to study in a good place. So there's this thing I read much later, I think it's by Malcolm Gladwell, he talks about these two models of education. So either a modeling agency route, or the army route in the modeling agency route, you have to prove that you're good enough. And then they take you on and they make you a model. In the army system, you get in, and they make you into a soldier, they put you through the grind to become a you don't have to prove yourself, you have basic qualifications, but you don't have to deserve to be there, the way you have to prove your worth to be a model, we've kind of follow the former one in India, simply because of our numbers, like we don't have a examination system, we have a filtration system. If you can get through this IIT JEE, then because of simply because now you are the top 5000 because of this exam, you deserve to be an IIT and it's nonsense. This is not how you decide 16 year old is not positioned to say whether he wants to be a mechanical or a computer science engineer or any of these things. It's just utter nonsense that we do. We tell people that they should choose what they need to do at this early age, then we berate them for not doing it enough, not committing hard enough. And then if it turns out many years later that they made the wrong choice, and they're sad, then we berate them again for why did you choose it in the first place. And how I think about it is that our entire country suffers from what I call the Abhimanyu complex, that we've all been taught how to get into this Kurukshetra from before birth only, that we have to get into it. Nobody tells you what you're supposed to do once you get in. Nobody tells you why you got in. Nobody tells you how you're going to get out. But you have to go that is beyond conversation or debate. And it really made me very angry. And I saw this foreign university and how they do things. And I decided I wanted to. This is how I told my father that I want to get a real education. Now I've had it like I really want to I gave these interviews, I have an ex I had a 8.7 CGPA. I have all these projects. I am the dean of our University of Manipal. He would he held us up as an example to follow in front of everybody. Things like this happened, but I did not feel like an engineer. I felt like I have faked it. I know what work I did. I know how little you demanded of me. This is not an education. I really want an education. And this ties into another idea I have about finite versus infinite games, which maybe you can broach it a little later. I wanted an education. So I went to the TU Delft, the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, I applied there because they had a great formula student racing team, a friend and I both were kind of swayed by this idea of biomechanics. And I got a little interested in the subject. So we did our bachelor's thesis in Manipal together, which was working out how the structure, the musculoskeletal structure of a knee joint, which has suffered from an ACL injury. And that got us animated about the subject of biomechanics. And I applied for a master's degree in biomechanics at the TU Delft. And I got in, I went there. And that was my master's degree. I spent two years in which I unlearned everything. My model for this is that I demolished everything. And I built a fresh foundation of knowledge. And biomechanical engineering came under the umbrella of control engineering, in a sense. And now I think of myself as a control engineer. And that term is super important to me. And I am a control engineer, even today that I'm an artist, in many ways. And I learned some very, very deep, profound, amazing things that I'm going to keep with me forever. And yeah, so I did this master's degree. And this whole time, bachelor's degree, master's degree, I'm writing my blog, I'm drawing these web comics, I started the web comic in the final year of bachelor's because everything was such a joke, man, like we weren't doing serious work, there was so much free time. And we were just messing the kind of things we did to kill time. So I started this web comic just to make fun of my friends, and make jokes about life. Because humor was my weapon, humor was my shield. And it's, I can't do that kind of humor anymore. So one of the reasons why that web comic stopped was that I couldn't do that humor anymore. And that was a very big moment in my life. And I realized why I can't do that humor anymore. And I'm writing and I'm writing and I'm writing and I'm doing this blog and I'm doing the web comic becomes from three times a week to once a week to once a month to once in two months, because my studies are taking up more time. And what's happening is that I'm moving away from my world. So I'm in this new place now. And I think that I should talk about Bollywood because that's what I used to make fun of, I think I should talk about Indian life, because that's what I know. And that's what my audience is about. And that's what I should talk about. But I'm moving away from it, and it's getting harder to do it. So I'm doing it less, and I'm feeling angrier because I'm not feeling fulfilled. After I finished my master's degree, I got offered a PhD program in the university. And this was so my master's degree, my master's thesis was on the subject of what is known as bimanual control. bimanual control is how you manually control your two arms or two legs. So example, juggling, or playing drums, things like that. And I was studying how there are these various models of bimanual control, how the brain does this. So if you try to keep a beat 6060 beats per minute with your right hand on the, and you can probably do a 30 beats per minute, meanwhile, so half of that frequency with your left hand, but if you try to do 20, it would get tougher if you try to do 25 and 60. So they're not multiples, it becomes very tough, because now your brain has to do these crazy computations. And it's very difficult, you have to train yourself to do it, you have to be a drummer or something like that was put in the hours, then they can achieve limb independence. Like different limbs are not in order to process complex information, what our brain does is it breaks it down into more like to reduce the processing load. So if you try to keep these very, very discordant beats with two different hands, and you're not trained as a drummer, your hands will automatically fall into a simpler rhythm. And that is your brain trying to be like, Oh, I can't do this. But this is a little easier to do. And I don't need to think about it too much. Because that kind of processing of two different beats is very difficult. It's a lot of processing power. So let's make it simpler. Why don't you do half of what this is instead of trying to do three fifths of what this is. So instead of a complex beat, a slightly simpler beat unless you train otherwise. So my thesis was about trying to figure out how these models work, and how the muscles and the nerves and how they form this control model to describe this whole thing, feedback and actuators and springs and dampers. So a mechanical system to describe a biological reality. This is what biomechanical design was about in my study, it was about the marriage of mechanical idea, mechanical principles and ideas to describe biological phenomena. And it has applications in robotics, it has applications in orthopedics and all kinds of assistive devices. But mine was because I am this stupid person who's just animated by difficult things, because they are interesting. I chose the toughest one that I could find for my PhD, which was how to stroke patients use their reflexes. So let's do neuroscience. And this led to this research project that was offered to me in my PhD program, which was about stroke patients. And the idea was to develop nice rehabilitation programs for stroke patients. So stroke patients have a whole bunch of rehab programs, which are very general. But what if we want to get specific, what if we want to cut down the rehab time, therefore, like what if we know this person needs three months of one thing instead of one year of this other thing, in order to become normal, we need to understand what is their deficiencies, we need to have a number for those deficiencies. So we need to quantify a lot of biological defects, quote unquote, or whatever the situation is post stroke. And we need to have as many variables as we can get to describe the system and get the numbers to where they need to be. So we need a mechanical understanding of this system, because mechanical systems have sensors, sensors give you numbers, and numbers are can be fit into equations, we need equations, and we need mechanical understandings of what's going on, like what happened in the brain? How does that react to the muscles? How do their arms move? How do you describe this arm and its movement as various mechanical phenomena? What are the numbers that are useful? What are the eigenvalues? So the eigenvalues are the least number of variables you need to describe something perfectly. What are the eigenvalues? What is the eigenvector? And what is the values within them? So these are the eigenvalues within the eigenvector, identify the vector. So it's a process of what's known as black box system identification. If you have a system that you can't open up, so it's a black box, you don't know how it literally works, you can only hit it and you can see what happens. So you can put an input, you can get an output. And then you can be output divide by input is equal to system. And then try to with intelligent inputs, try to figure out what is this system. So we need to do black box system identification of brain of a body that has been affected by a stroke, a cortical stroke, and therefore has muscular neuromuscular deficiencies. And that meant learning a lot more about biology. So project was in collaboration with the Northwestern University in Chicago. And I went to Chicago to do experiments. The first time I went to Chicago, and I was vehemently opposed to it because I hated America at that point. I thought it represents all the evil of the world and I don't want to be in America, I'm not gonna like it. Chicago means guns and violence. I got to Chicago during the first polar vortex of 2013. It was three days, the first three days were shut down, nobody went anywhere, minus 45 degrees Celsius. The first day that I stepped out, I fell in love with the city completely. Chicago absolutely changed my whole life. Everything I am today, everything that I've been able to do is because of that city. And I went there only because of doing all these other random things that were not what I really, really, really wanted to do. They were simply things I was good at. And there is this joy of achievement you get. And that's also a nice high, it's a nice kick. I'm good at it. And I do it and I get rewarded and it's nice. University system rewards are nicely set up. You know, you do this much work, you get so reward and it feels nice, you can feel good about life. And it carries you through to a lot. So it brought me to Chicago. And I'm doing experiments with stroke patients, fascinating people. I met somebody who used to train with Chuck Norris. I met someone who was on the original 21 team, the MIT team that did the thing in Vegas or Atlantic City, the blackjack players. So he has now had a stroke, he would take 15 minutes to come from the door to the seat. Because he couldn't walk, he would walk so slowly. But he had stories like he had real stories. Now he travels to casinos all over the world. In order to spot card counters. He teaches people how to spot card counters because he's one of them. This is the outlaw who's become the sheriff. Exactly, right. So this is how he makes his money. And he would tell me these stories while we were doing nine hour long experiments. It would take me half an hour just to unclench his fist because of the stroke. And it's so debilitating. But anyway, so I'm doing these experiments, I'm learning, I'm having a good time implementing these ideas, figuring things out. But I'm feeling creatively unfulfilled. I want to write, I want to be a writer. This is the first thing I said to my girlfriend on our first date we met in Manipal in the first year. And I told her one day I'm going to be a writer. And she just laughed that oh, you're an engineer, you're becoming an engineer, though. And there's no pathway visible. How will you? How do you become a writer? There's no pathway to becoming a writer anyway. But I wanted it I this is what I wanted to do. And I've always doing it on the side. And what Chicago did was that after my experiments in the evenings, I would go to open mic nights. I would write because I've always been writing funny things. I did stand up, I would go up on stage in front of a bunch of people who are not from my world, who will not understand the jokes that I've always written. So I have to say something new. And I have to say something that they will get and they will laugh at. And sometimes I failed. Sometimes I did pretty well. Maybe they were being kind, I don't know. But I got this rush from it. And first rush was that I did it. The second rush was that I was surrounded by people, some of whom were not very good. But I would see them every night at this club, the next club, because so Chicago is a is the world capital of stand up comedy. Every night of the week, you can find a free open mic somewhere or the other as audience or as a wannabe comedian. Same for music. And every night of the week, you can find it. I would see these guys night after night after night. I'm not doing anything because I'm nervous today. I don't feel like doing it. But this guy's going and he's not very good. I know he's not good, but he's really doing this. And I got this from America, but if you really want to do it, just do it. And that's when I sort of understood what they keep talking about when they say freedom, because I didn't get it before this. Americans are crazy people. They just do things like they just they just do whatever they want to do. Like, they have no qualms. They have no they don't feel like misfits. It's interesting. Like the word misfit, right? The word misfit implies that you're supposed to fit. Because that's what Indian culture is you fit. And if you otherwise you're a misfit, and that's a bad thing. What if there's no standard of fitting? You can't be a misfit anymore, right? What if there's no requirement to fit? That's what America was like. They'll just say anything like people will be dressed in all kinds of ways. People will be having these super dramatic phone call conversations on the bus, not caring that people can hear hear them. People are like really being themselves on a stage, even if they are introverted in real life, what freedom and they gave me permission to do the same. I looked at them and I said, Why am I not doing this? Because I have a certain degree of privilege. My girlfriend had started working. She's a dentist. She went to the US to study to practice there. And she just started working. And she told me why aren't you doing this? You want to be a writer become a writer? Why are you doing this PhD stuff? I thought No, I have what I can't I can't quit. Can I? But Chicago told me Yes, why can't you quit? You have the freedom. If you want to do it, you have to do it. And I recognized that I have the privilege. A lot of people want to do these things, but they their circumstances don't allow them to maybe they really need to earn next month's rent. Maybe they really have big big loans to pay off. My PhD program luckily paid me nicely enough that I was able to pay off my master student loan. And I had somebody willing to support me. I felt like privilege was like this trampoline with the privilege came the responsibility. How can you ignore the value of your privilege? There are people who want to do this who are not able to you can do it and you want to do it, but you are afraid of how we will explain it. I can't do that. That's not okay. I wanted to do something that I really, really, really wanted to chase. And at the same time with my studies, I had come to this idea that a PhD program needs 200% from you. This has to be what you sleep dream about. This is what you think about all the time. I knew that honestly, I'm able to give this 90%. I like it. I'm excited by learning. But PhD is not about learning. You are now at the at the at the frontier. You have to discover you have to prove things. And I am not as motivated in this field with the level of explicit mathematical knowledge it needs not an implicit understanding, but an explicit application of the knowledge. And I am not enamored by that aspect. I loved it while I was learning things. But now that I have to do further, I am not as excited anymore. And I'm surrounded by people who are excited by it. All my fellow researchers, my fellow PhD postdocs, they were super enamored and excited and passionate about their things. And I felt like I was faking it in comparison to them. And that's not fair to them. That's not fair to my professors. And that's not how things like I don't want my life to be about that. So quite quickly, I reached this decision that this means that I'm quitting. And I've I feel I've kind of always been like that. Like I can't do something if I'm not once I lose interest, I can't push myself anymore. Like that's the day that I just stop. And so I just stopped like just like how I stopped studying organic chemistry in class 11. And I paid the price in my ITJ exams and all the other exams, all the organic chemistry sections are empty. I didn't answer anything because I like I can't do it. It's not something I hate it. So I stopped. I told my professor I'm leaving. I went home and I told my parents"

And they were okay with it. They have empowered me a lot. They have given me the permission to do things, to be myself, to even disobey is a permission like I have never faced serious consequences for disagreeing with them. I have never been punished in I have never like, you know, been slapped or corporal punishment or in threatened or intimidated. So that also is permission. And that made me who I am. And they trusted who I am. When I told them that I'm quitting my PhD program to be a writer, I could show them 400 webcomic strips that I had drawn. I could show them dozens of scripts I had written. I had written for a YouTube show at that time. I had done I had written six months for NDTV's Gustakhi Maaf, the puppet 6-7 minute puppet show episodes they would have about current events. I had done that. I had so many blog articles and stories. I had all these ideas. I had put in the work. And I was telling them that instead of doing this in the evening, with two hours of time, I want this to be my race. This is how I put it to them that everything is a marathon. There's no overnight success. Everything is going to take a lot out of me. I want to be in the race that I want to be in. I have understood which race I want to be in. And at this point, it is wrong for me to continue in the other race simply with the idea that finish to Karlo. My mother still sometimes says this to me Khatam to Karleta PhD. And it's just key, I would have lost two or two and a half more years. And once I knew that I don't want to do it, it's not good. It's not fair anyway. And that's a different argument like to others around me for me to continue in this fake mode. But it's not fair to myself to do this thing. So I quit. My girlfriend was working in Chicago. We got married a few months after that, I moved in with her and I started to become a writer. And then I started on this journey that suddenly made me an artist. But we can go into that. I think I should pause"

        "message": "at this point because I've been going on and on. No, no. These are the conversations which are most delightful to me when I can just sit back and listen. Bunch of things I want to double click into. But before I continue, you know, with your journey as a writer slash artist and all of that bunch of things. Firstly, you know what you said about education strikes a chord and many guests have spoken on this topic before I think Anirban Mahapatra was the last and in fact, the most popular episode of my show right now, overtaking my episodes on Kashmir and CAA with Srinath Raghavan is the one I did on education with Karthik Muralidharan, which has just gotten to number one. And there he speaks at length about how our system is set up for sorting not teaching exactly as you said, you just want to sort out who are the brightest kids and then whatever happens happens and you see the successes of that but don't realize that it was because of incredibly smart to begin with and you found them and not necessarily that you taught them something. Earlier you were talking about your cynicism. And you've written a beautiful post about this, which of course I linked from the show notes. But I want to read out a bit from that before I go on to my next question, where you talk about how you discovered the power of being cynical. And you write quote, cynicism was smartness, cynicism was pragmatic, cynicism was a way of adults. I took pride in my cynicism. It helped me fight off insecurities before the popular guys in school. It helped me deal with my social inadequacies. It gave me a sense of humor. I won many battles with the sharp edge of my wit. Over the years, I honed it to terrific sharpness. In college, a professor asked me not to be over smart. I asked him to explain exactly how smart I should be in that case. He kicked me out of the class but the rest of the students laughed and that was my win. I made funny comics mocking the idiosyncrasies of my friends. I wrote funny stories with elaborate dialogue and plots that pointed to the foolishness of trying the inevitable failure of all action. I made a lot of people laugh, and so on. And then you say in a later para, but one day I found the fountain of my creativity had gone dry. I could not write. After struggling for many months, I came to the conclusion that I had reached the end of my tether with cynicism. Cynicism is like a wall we build inside our mind brick by brick. We do it to protect what is most vulnerable inside us. We hide that thing behind walls so others cannot know. So they cannot mock us the way we mock them. It shields us from people and also from other horrors of the outside world, pain and fear and shame and rejection. Nothing cannot breach these defenses. Every year the walls grow higher. Every morning you climb the ramparts and rain arrows upon the enemy at the gates, stop good. Which is sort of a beautifully put description of a defense mechanism, which many of us have, which I think to some extent I also had when I was a kid where with your cleverness, you know, it's like you don't know where you stand in the world. So to hide the doubts of your own inadequacies, you you adopt a superior position by mocking others. And that's really easy to do. And that's something that you see on Twitter all the time where everyone's standing in judgment upon everybody else because that's easy to do. It's an easy way to say, look, I'm so virtuous. I'm so good. I'm so right. But my question is not about that. My question is that in your writing this there is tremendous self-awareness. And one of the things I've realized about my own writing when I do look back is that a lot of that self-awareness comes from writing about it. That till the moment that you start writing and you start examining your childhood, you are not aware that you were like this, but then it becomes explicit. Like in a sense, you spoke earlier in the context of your PhD program that you were more towards implicit understanding and not explicit application. And here it seems that by writing, you're getting this implicit understanding of your own self. And then just that understanding in a sense is automatically an explicit application because you are changing as you look back on the older you. So is this how it was for you as well, that writing became also a powerful"

        "message": "tool to understand yourself? Yeah. Yeah. So once writing started to become difficult for the first time, like why did it become difficult for the first time? I reached this very profound understanding that I want to share. It's simply put the fact that other people exist. That's it. I am not the universe and other people are not revolving around me. They are actually real people. Women are real people too. I can't just make sexist jokes. Other people have other skills and they might not be good with their words. And this might be my superpower, so to say, but this doesn't make me powerful. This doesn't make me a hero. If I have hurt someone, other people exist. And this took time because initially this first phase of writing the blogs that I wrote from 2006 to 2010, the comics that I drew, I was the only person who existed. I was the unfortunate one. I was the I had no privilege. I was suffering. I was sidelined. I was hitting back. So everything was allowed. I'm defending myself. I'm not lashing out. I'm defending myself. So everything is allowed. In the process of writing stories, though, what happens is like these walls that I wrote about that you quoted, these walls that you build up, what it does is it encloses your world. And I realized that if I want to write good stories, I have to feel real things. I have to grow my world. You can't grow your world once you've built walls. You have to shatter those walls and then you have to accept everything. You have to accept everything that comes, including the pain. Cynicism helps to shield you from pain and from explicitly feeling pain. But you have to welcome that pain. You have to welcome sadness and you have to welcome feeling inadequate and processing that as a human emotion that is valid and not something to be shunned. And then let's just make a quick repartee and then forget about it because look, I'm funny. This process was important to go through because I wanted to be a good writer. I wanted to be not a successful writer in the literal term. I wanted to be a really good writer. I wanted to do all the really great things and thereby get success. But success was not the end. The end was being really, really good. And that means feeling this pain, letting this pain happen to you. And I would read more things and I would read books and I would see people go through this. So I remember reading Shantaram in which he talks about the process of grieving and the process of loss. And this is this big hulking New Zealand person who is talking about crying and talking about crying alone in a room and hiding his tears from other people. And he makes you feel it. I wanted to do that. I wanted to not just feel it. I wanted to make people feel it. That's the kind of writer I want to be. I want to be able to like if people have heartstrings, I want to play them. I want to be able to play music on other people's heartstrings. I want to tug at them and pull at them and pluck at them at my will. I want to have that power. And that power means giving up control. That power means shattering these walls and letting in the whole world. Once I did that, the immediate consequence was that the first source of my humor, which is pointing at other people and laughing, ran dry. I couldn't do it. I couldn't be that cynical person anymore. Cynicism had to be defeated. I had to let the shields down. So I did that. And that was really important for me to become the kind of writer who could write the way that you've read out that to be able to be self-aware like that, so that I can write stories in which my characters are not self-aware, but are going through these things. The writer has to know so much more than his characters are allowed to know. I think about this quote from a movie I saw. I don't know if you've seen it. It's called Superman of Malegaon. So it's this independent movie. It's about a bunch of filmmakers in Malegaon, which is, I think, in Maharashtra itself. And they have Maliwood. They make movies with a handicap. They have no technology, but they want to make a Superman movie now. So this is a documentary following these real people who are actually trying to make a Superman movie, Superman of Malegaon. And the documentary is called Superman of Malegaon because these people are the supermen. And they are finding out what is a green screen and how do you do video editing for a green screen. It's a fantastic movie. It's on YouTube to watch. Everybody should watch it. Like truly profound movie and beautifully made, very funny. But the writer in that movie, he says this thing that it's stuck, it's seared into my brain. He said that the best writer in the best of times can communicate only a tenth of what he wants to communicate. The rest of the pain he has to bear. It is his pain. He will never be able to share it. Not being able to share it is pain. But even that emotion itself is unshared, has to live inside him 10 times the emotion of what he's able to put out. So to be a good writer, it was my responsibility to take 10 times that pain that I wanted to show. Another reason why I had to break down these walls. In the effort, therefore, of trying to be a good writer, I realized what I was doing wrong. In writing again and again, this character, these ideas and putting them out in stories and failing, I realized what I was doing wrong before. And that's where all of the self-realization came from. A bit of the externalization is thanks to the fact that I lived in the Netherlands where you have access to excellent recreational drugs to help you with externalization. But mostly it was the writing and the really wanting to be good, just good."

        "message": "So this is a lovely word I came across in another of your newsletter posts from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows. And it's a word called Sonder, which is defined as, quote, the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own, populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries, and inherited craziness. An epic story in which you might appear only once as an extra sipping coffee in the background as a blur of traffic passing on the highway as a lighted window at dusk, stop quote. You know, and this obviously speaks to that thing you said about realizing that there were other people. And you've also quoted, you know, Sartre in another of your posts saying hell is other people, which is something, you know, as an introvert, I completely get where that is coming from. And I don't know if it's a moral dilemma or an existential dilemma or what category it falls into. But when the time comes that you realize this, and you realize this in a visceral way, and you realize that you've kind of been living your life as if you are all that matters, and everyone else is a character in the play inside your own head, it then takes moral significance that you make them something more of a character, a mere character that you see them as a flesh and blood people as they are, you know, to invoke, you know, Kant's categorical imperative, that you see them as not a means to an end, but as an end in itself. And even if I remind myself of that, I wonder if I find it hard to do and at some level, I wonder if it's possible to do at all. And with you this kind of, I mean, you've probably thought much more about this, because a lot of what you are known for when people first hear of you, the whole sneaky art business is really absorbing other people as other people, and letting yourself be the background. So on the one hand, you are just conscious of other people, it's, you know, you're making them vivid. But on the other hand, you are the one observing, it is what you are doing, it is an act of ego, or just assuming that something that you draw of other people add something to the world or is meaningful. And again, an act of ego and arrogance that you also written about eloquently. So, you know, so what are sort of your thoughts on all of this?"

So when I went to the US, I gave up a lot of things, right, I gave up a previous identity, I gave up the race that I was in, in favor of something new. And I had to redefine these structures of my life. One of the early silly little thing that I had was that I had lived a very nicely categorizable life, like quantifiable life, you could measure success, what is a good day, this is the work I have today as a researcher, this so much progress, I can measure it, I can put a percentage term to it, I can evaluate it as a monthly, yearly, six monthly basis and understand how well I did. But as a creative person, how the hell do I find out what is a good day of work? There are no numbers anymore. There is no way to quantify there are no good metrics. For a time, I became like really big on Google Calendar, like putting everything like there is one year of my life, which is entirely on Google Calendar every single day, every single hour. And I thought that would help, but it didn't. But anyway, the point of this is that I was redefining a lot of life, life's understand purpose point, how I am who I am. And I was in this new world, I was an immigrant in the new world. Part of what also helps you to remain this, I am the only thing that matters in India is, it's nice, it's easy if you're a male in India, right? So if you go to another place where you're suddenly not the top dog, not at the top of the pyramid, you suddenly see that, oh, there is this pyramid. Because now I'm not at the top anymore, I get to see up and there is people above me and I get to see also down sometimes. And then I see, oh, wait, I'm somewhere in the middle here. So there is this whole structure here. And this was another way to sort of, I needed to put myself somewhere, I needed to see where I belong, I needed to see who I am, and what is this place, it's another line of curiosity that came in, right? So I'm, I want to learn things I want to learn now about this world that I inhabit. So, sneaky art started as my way, one of the reasons it became this way was that I wanted to unobtrusively observe my world to see what this world is all about. Because I was in these alien places. While I was in Chicago for a few months, it was good, one of the most beautiful famous cities of the world, buildings and tourist destinations and all kinds of people you can, so much stuff for art. And I'm a sneaky artist, we kind of didn't go into how that started, we will again, but just coming to this point, is that I was trying to really just see how things operate. Once I moved to Wisconsin, I wanted to see, now that I don't have these big tourist attractions, these obvious artistic choices, it will look great, look at these amazing skyscrapers of Chicago, everybody will want to see it. How do I find art now in this world? It's a semi rural town I was in, I had no mental picture of, there were no people who looked like me around, there were just other people. It was the start of the Trump years. And I had all reasons to feel out of place and nervous. And like I don't belong. I needed to find a way to belong. And art became my way to sort of discover that. And this helped me to, to see other people, to observe other people, because I didn't, I couldn't be obsessed with myself, because I knew that I don't matter here. So I was sort of helped by these adverse circumstances to reject my ideas of myself. And to just see because I desperately need to feel comfortable in this uncomfortable place. Because I'm such an alien, I feel like an alien every day. So I need to look at these people, I need to understand these people. And I need to find out the ways that they are not different, but the ways that they are similar to me, so that I can feel that we have a bond, so that I can feel comfortable about going to a cafe, which has only people who look completely"

Does the looking change you like one of the things that I've noticed in myself, and I think in a lot of people, but it's there in differing degrees to people is how much of the world is invisible or unseen, as it were, to me that I go on the street, and I'm not even noticing most people right. And for you one, I imagine that the just the act of looking and looking with the kind of closeness that you must have looked would have changed something about you in some way, like in the context of podcasts, and you're also a podcaster. And we'll talk about both of these in detail, as we go along both the public art and the podcasting. But I do feel that doing these long episodes kind of forced me to listen much more and therefore, made me a better listener and maybe made me a better person on the margins, because I'm just listening more. And I'm not, it's not all about me, me. It's not about the ego. It's not about always trying to interrupt to show how smart you are, but actually kind of sit back and take it in and learn something. So do you feel that in that sense that not just the looking, also in the context of the podcast, you also now do long episodes, which are more than three hours, the looking, the listening, that they change the person you are that when you look at, say the Nishant who started drawing the web comics back in the day with the cynicism and the sarcasm and the cleverness and the biting wit, and you look at yourself today, where that cynicism and sarcasm and biting wit are not there, you're just sitting back and you're watching, or you're sitting back and you're listening.

So the best time to talk to me, if you want to say things to me, is to get me to start drawing things because then I won't move for an hour and I'll be listening. I'm sure this is a lesson your wife is learning. This is the one pleasure she gets from the fact that I am likely to sit down anywhere and start drawing, which is quite a problem when you go on vacation, that this guy just takes out a sketchbook everywhere. And then he wants a half hour over here when we could be doing something else. So it's a pros and cons. But as I like to remind her, this is a good time to talk to me. I am listening. So like Frasier Crane. Yeah, so being an artist, like the kind of artist I am, it has really made me very observant. And you're right exactly that the way our life is right now, we don't give too much attention to things because so many things demand our attention all the time. There is not only things around us. So if you compare to 100 years ago, the amount of traffic, the amount of hoardings and signals and people, all of these are things that requires little, little bits of attention, even just to be aware of them. Then there's the phone. Maybe it rings, maybe it pings, maybe it doesn't. And there is the possibility that there is amazing stuff happening on Twitter right now. So that maybe there's something I'm missing out on is also another attention requirement in the back of your head, which you have to sort of drill down and bury deep into you in order to neglect that maybe I should just scroll Instagram for a bit just to see maybe something amazing is happening, even if it isn't. I sometimes feel that just this, those few seconds that I spend before I launch the app, that moment of expectation is the joy. That's a dopamine coming. The expectation of the dopamine is the dopamine at this point. So because inevitably, there's nothing interesting on Twitter, it aggravates me instead. But"

And it has helped me to drown out these noises. So the only time I'm not actively thinking and overthinking, which I am apt to do is when I'm drawing. The only time I'm not worried about where I am and what million stupid things are running through my head anxieties is when I'm drawing it, I'm at complete peace, just absolutely Zen. I am a little bit nervous until I start to draw about where I am, are people looking at me, etc, etc. This is I'm self conscious. But the moment I put the pen to the paper, I lose all of that those moments are just so precious to me. And I speak to urban sketches on my podcast, and we talk about this experience and what it does, why we do it. Because if you think about it, the idea that there are grown adults who spend their precious leisure time walking around the street sitting with a sketchbook drawing something, most of them are not going to sell that art. Most of them are not necessarily great artists, but they still do it. The vast majority of the global urban sketching community and it is a huge growing community all over the world. The vast majority of it are not professional artists. And those people absolutely fascinate me, because they have a real articulated to themselves reason for for doing this. And a reason that has nothing to do with an end. With another end. It's not a means to at the end of making sales or becoming an artist or becoming big or sharing getting 5000 likes. The activity is the end itself. They are getting something from just doing this. And that is the real joy that I acquire in my podcast as well. And I get this from people that it doesn't matter how you draw, what it looks like is so irrelevant. Just that you spend two hours doing it is the joy of that two hours is the real value that you really squeezed those two hours for everything. So I look through my sketchbook. Now, there is the things that I drew. So there is the things that I looked at. But there are the things that I didn't draw. I look through a sketchbook that is two years old. And I can remember sounds I can remember if I was listening to a podcast or if I was overhearing a conversation. I can I remember the smells I remember the temperature of the day I remember if it was windy. I remember what it felt like to be sitting where I was sitting who was around me. All these senses come rushing back. It's as if I'm in this hyper aware state. And all of those things are locked into that page. And this is not just me. I'm not special in this. This is a case for anybody who's doing this. This is consistent with all urban sketches I speak to. It's simply the act of doing this, that does this to you the act of observation, and the act of patient observation, the value of giving not just your attention, but really giving your time to something sustained attention. It's become so rare. We don't even do that to the television we're watching. We watch TV and we're also scrolling at the same time on our phones. Most television is watched like that now. But this is something because it involves your hands and your eyes and you have to be sitting you can't be doing 10 different things. And it pushes you to engage. And that is the most beautiful thing you can do. And you find amazing art everywhere that you look once you start to do it."

And it's weird that I find it very hard to come about and the other things I do like writing, for example, it's just very hard to get in the zone. Most of the time, it's just hard work and you kind of have to battle through it and get it done. But this kind of thing, just sitting and drawing something seems to me to combine two things. One is that your mind is kind of empty. It's not cluttered with other stuff happening. And at the same time, it's very focused on what you're doing. And at the same time, there's a physical aspect to it where your hands are kind of moving and all of that. And you point out that many of the people you speak to also experience the same kind of flow doing this. So perhaps if you don't think of it as art, you know, it's something therapeutic and useful on its own. Is that what you'd say?"

        "message": "Well, so the word art is a very strange word. So many people define it in such terrible, oppressive, prohibitive ways. Art with a capital A especially, it's a scary word. We would rather not do it because we don't want to be pretending like we can do it because we're not allowed to do it. Not anybody can just make art. Who am I to just make art? And I don't know if it helps to think of it like that. Or maybe the the key is to defeat this terrible notion of what is art and oh my God, am I an artist? Maybe the key is to not think like this and to just own the word. Yes, I am an artist. I can call it art. The definition of art is changing now so quickly because artists are able to reach so many people and find success through so many channels on Instagram, YouTube, blah, blah, blah, TikTok. So there is no one ladder. There is no single definition. This allows more people to own this term. But what I'm trying to say is that I think the real purpose of art is just this. Like art is not supposed to be the job of an elite minority. Art is not about that, like you compare it to writing. And that's a very interesting comparison. Because to me, writing is fun after having done it. It's nice that I feel great the rest of the day having got it out of me. But getting it out of me is an excruciating process. And I flip tabs and I do all kinds of terrible, wrong things that Da Vinci could never have done. But I'm doing them. And when I'm drawing, I'm not. So art is different from drawing from writing for me very much because the joy of it is in the doing of it. And the result does not matter. I get the same joy from the drawing I do today, as the drawing I did the first time I did it when I went outside to draw, I look at the drawing and it's not as good. Obviously, I've really become a much better artist in four, five years. But the level of joy is the same. And it is very, very high. Once you tap into this idea, the reason why this is a good exercise is not so that you become an artist, nevermind becoming an artist, don't don't draw all the time, don't ever think about ever becoming good at it or selling. It's just a good idea to get used to this habit, that some things are good just to do. Some things are good just to do because spending time in a good way is a good idea. Getting used to this notion that there are some things you can find joy from just in doing them is a very useful notion because then you start to seek it in other avenues in your life maybe. And that is how you become a better person. You start to understand that some activities can bring me joy. Maybe I should look for some other activities that are similar to this and you will find it for a while running to me felt like the joy is only after the run. But now the process of the run is the joy even with aching limbs and everything. The time I spend running is beautiful me time that I just enjoy. And incidentally, it is also you time because I'm often listening to your podcast while I run. But this idea, this concept that you should do things which bring you joy. It's amazing how easy it is to get used to it once you do a few drawings. And hopefully you carry it into other spheres of your life as well."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean, it also makes me sort of think about the notion of joy. Like I think a lot of things that we take happiness from, we take happiness from looking back at them, you know, we'll remember a certain time, and we'll say, Oh, I was happy then. But the point is, if you were not in the moment, then, then you were nothing, you were not happy or sad or whatever shit was happening. And now in the looking back, you're finding the happiness. So there is a kind of happiness where you're almost forcing yourself to be happy, you look back on that and say, Oh, you know, I had such a lovely conversation with so and so and, you know, and that makes you happy. But then there's another kind of happiness, which is something that, you know, I wish I could have more of in my life where you're just happy in the moment, where the rest of that shit doesn't matter with the narratives you build around yourself don't matter at all. And I know what you mean by running because like a couple of years ago, I was like 20 kgs lighter and I was running and stuff. I remember running a 10k and I get some of that where initially like I remember one of the interesting things that made me you know, stay with running after I got into it was that every morning you might get up and there'll be many days where you think that hey, I don't want to run today. But after you run, you're always glad you ran every single time there was not a single time that I regretted going out to run today, right? You just know that after the run, you'll be glad that you ran. And so I completely kind of get that analogy and does it then demand that you live a different kind of life? Like there is one kind of life where you're completely in the moment, you're drawing something or you're running, or maybe you're playing an instrument or whatever it is, but you're completely in the moment. And there's another kind of life where you are focused either on the past or the future, where for example, you might be trying to sell your art, you might be trying to chatting with a publisher and deciding publishing details or you might be talking to an event organizer and saying, hey, I'll come there and do this live drawing and all of that. And these seem therefore almost opposed to each other than the purest form of living, it would seem to me at one level is to ignore the hustle entirely, and just do the drawing. And you don't just do that you also do the other stuff. In fact, you know, after the break, one of the themes that I want to ask you a lot about is this sort of dual life that an artist like you lives where you're not just an artist, but you're also a salesman of your own art. You're also an entrepreneur of your own brand, right, which are all impressive to me, you know, I'd love to be able to do the same things. But what are you really living for? And at one level and not as in what are you trying to live for? But as a general question, it would seem to me that you already have that what you're trying to live for, which is just being present in that moment and having that joy."

        "message": "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think the reason why I draw is the same reason by another urban sketcher who might be a lawyer or an architect draws, we are getting that joy in the moment. Maybe the argument would then be that it helps the rest of life to go by to know that you have this source of pure joy, you can do some other things just for the work, you can do some other things for not the same kind of rewards, you are getting your rewards or your nice dopamine from this one activity. The Marwadi instinct in me is that of a salesman, but I hate it. I hate doing it. I don't like I get I get a kick out of it. But sometimes I feel like I'd rather not. I hate thinking about money. Again, very wrong instinct considering who I am. But I hate thinking about I hate thinking about money. And I'm terrible at thinking about money and working with money and investing and just horrible at it. Never know how much money I'm carrying or what I should do with it, etc. But being an artist, I get certain joys from this act of being an artist. And that puts me in a frame of mind where I feel like, okay, now I can do some of the work work things, the quote unquote work things which are not the same, because I have done this. And now I want to take and my business is being an artist. So therefore, my business is again related to the thing that I got joy from which is my art. But if I was not an artist, if I was just doing this, I feel like this would make me simply a calmer person in the rest of my life. This I have this source for whenever I need pure joy, I get it from here. Now I can get on with the rest of my life and get whatever else I get from that."

Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with sneaky artist, Nishant Jain. You know, Nishant, I should have, you know, randomly cornered you somewhere and recorded this conversation with you without your knowing it was being recorded. Now that would have been sneaky and most kind of appropriate. So, you know, while digressing all over the place, we got enough through the linear journey of your life to find you in Chicago where you've to locate you in Chicago where you've decided that man, I want to be a writer and you know, this pyramid is not for me. I want to do the things that I love. The universe has given me permission as it were, and you move on to that. Now that's writer and then you become a sneaky artist. So take me through a little bit of that journey about drawing like were you into drawing from before that? How was all of that kind of working out?"

        "message": "So like most children, I was drawing and I was encouraged to draw but also like most children when they grow up, drawing is something that kids do. So you stop doing it. So I stopped doing it like we were speaking before I started drawing these webcomics which were in my limited ability of the time I was doing stick figures. They were quick turnaround like I have a joke I can draw it and realize it in 30 minutes and post it. And instead of Facebook in those days was very generous, not like the Facebook it is today, I could reach my whole audience and I did fairly well for myself. Now when I was at this juncture in Chicago, my idea was that I'm a writer and I'm a cartoonist. And now that I'm doing this full time, both of these things, I owe it to myself to do them better. And I had ambitions as a cartoonist because I've also read graphic novels and I wanted to draw incredible deep things. Basically, I wanted to tell stories that stick figures could not do justice to. I needed my figures to be recognizable. I needed them to be distinct. I needed to draw worlds that resembled actual worlds, not just have them suspended in white ether. So I needed to learn how to draw. And I tried to do these different things I did. Actually, before I became an urban sketcher before sneaky art, I did this thing on Reddit. There's this subreddit called Reddit gets drawn in which people post interesting photos of themselves and artists of various persuasions. They make portraits and they post it, you get upvoted and a lot of artists are there. So as an aspiring artist, it is good because you see a reference photo and you see 20 realizations of it in different styles. And as an aspiring artist, if you contribute, you get nice comments, you get feedback. It's a very thriving subreddit. I drew maybe 400 portraits in like a year. Like I would sit in one sitting, I would make five portraits in half an hour. So quickly, quickly, quickly. And this is a function of my inclinations that I draw quickly, that I wanted to do things in one go. I didn't want to do layers and layers. I can think of it as lazy, but who you are sort of informs the art you make. And it's good to lean into who you are. And I'll touch upon that a little later. But I wanted to be a better artist. And I knew that this needs me to draw more and more. I'm learning some skills from doing these Reddit gets drawn portraits, but that's not enough. Like I need to know how to draw cities and nothing is working. I need to put in the hours and I don't know how. So I needed to find things that I could merge together. And Chicago was perfect for that. I loved the city. I wanted to explore it. How do I explore it? Let's take a sketchbook and I'll have a reason to explore it. So I will get this kick of exploring the city. But the way to really look at it would be that I draw it. So I will keep drawing because the idea is that I will go out with a sketchbook and I'll look at things and I'll draw the interesting things I see. So if I combine my love for this and exploration of the city with drawing, I'll build a sustainable drawing habit and eventually surely I will learn how to draw. That was the idea. Now, one more thing I did in this pursuit was one rule I set for myself is that I will draw with a pen and I had a fountain pen, which is the fountain pen I use today. And I will draw with this fountain pen, not a pencil because I have a perfectionist nature or a very exacting nature and I'm very cruel on myself. So I never finish things. I just keep erasing and redoing. And I needed to turn the page metaphorically and literally. So fountain pen ink on paper, no steps backwards. Every line I draw is there in full contrast. So I can only finish drawings. I can't change them. And I can only draw again if I want to improve and draw more if I want to improve. So this was a constraint I set upon myself. Another theme I come in my podcast very often and we should talk about it again is constraints bring freedom. They don't restrict you. They set you free. And I talk about how that this manifests in different ways as an artist and how useful it is. But so I'm doing this. I'm walking around Chicago and I'm drawing things in my sketchbook with a pen. Not very well, but doing it every day. And I am a little not ashamed is not the word, but it's a little ridiculous. I think I'm a grown adult. It's too late for me to learn to draw. And I'm how am I going to explain this to anyone? What if they look at me? What do they last? What are you doing? What will I say? I'm trying to learn how to draw. Like I'm a grown adult who quit his job and is now trying to walk around drawing things. They laugh or I'll"

So but when you make a nice practice out of beating yourself up, then all of these things are the tools you use. So why not? So I wanted to hide. I'll go and I'll draw and I'll draw quickly and I'll just get out of there before they see me. I will be sneaky. So the first idea I had of sneaky art, the first definition I had of this word, and it has evolved since then. So sneaky art 1.0 is that I am sneaky looking for art and I draw and within half an hour before I'm conspicuous, I'm gone. And I kept doing this. And this is how I sort of learned how to draw better. I merged it with the love of the city and exploring the city full of fantastic, crazy people. And what happened therefore also is that I realized what are the things I like looking at? What are the things that catch my eye? And this is such a nice thing to learn about yourself. Like what do you find interesting as a person? And I didn't explicitly realize it at the time, but this is such a fantastic way to become an artist, to know what you want to draw. All these years as a child and as a young adult, when I was practicing how to draw, there were these how to draw books. Usme you have eyes with hyper-realistic detail. Usme you have body anatomies in hyper-realistic detail. You have birds and animals. These are incidentally none of the things I can draw even today. I can't draw birds and animals. I can't draw hyper-realistic eyes and feet and legs. I'm bad at it, but I'm a decently well-to-do artist who can't draw these basic things because there's not a single way to become an artist. And from doing it this way, from feeling like an outsider, forcing himself in, I chanced upon this thing. I'll only learn if I keep drawing more and I'll only draw more if I draw the things I like. And by doing this, I'm finding out, oh, these are the things I like. When I flip through the sketchbook, I'm like, oh, this is what I look at. Oh, this is what I look at. Oh, this is what I found interesting in this space over here when I could have also been looking at this other thing. Specifically, what kind of things surprised you about the way you look? Yeah, so this was to do with being an immigrant here, right? So I'm trying to understand this world, how it works. And I found the things that fascinated me were the people. So you have this city where the temperature goes from minus 40 to plus 40. 80 degrees of difference happens over the course of a year. And no matter the temperature, these people go about their lives. I came upon this understanding of what is a city. So a city, if you think about it, has no reason to exist. It has only one reason to exist. A city exists because humans need things. We want to get from A to B. So there are roads. We want to get there efficiently. So there are buses on these roads and there are bus stops. We might need money. So there are ATM machines and sometimes we get tired. So there are cafes with coffees and there are places for lunch. So all of these things are not natural things. They exist because of human need. And this is what I was understanding. What is the way that people interact with things in their cities? How do people live in a city? What is the function of a city and how do people use these various functions to get about their day? So I was fascinated by just the sea of humanity you see at a metro station. These are all people from different social classes, different economic classes, getting into this train to go from A to B. In this moment, we are all together. We are all trying to do the same thing. We don't know each other. We're not looking at each other. We're not speaking to each other. We don't want anything to do with each other maybe. But we are united in this common purpose and therefore this train exists. I was thinking about how tall buildings are. And a building is only tall if there is a human next to it. So I came upon this set of questions. Is a cafe a cafe if there is no person drinking coffee inside it? What makes it a cafe is the person drinking coffee inside it. I came upon this question when I was drawing a cafe. Realized that it is until the point that I draw a person with a coffee, this is just an interior space. Is it a mug unless there is coffee in it? It's just this thing made of ceramic. We give it purpose. We give it value. We give it context. And that is how these things, a building is tall because humans are six feet or five feet tall. And a building is so many times taller"

        "message": "Yeah, yeah, it's it's beautiful because I found myself thinking along these lines, the more I did these things, that this exists because I am looking at it. This has meaning because this random person came in here looking for a coffee. So this person is integral. If I want to say that I drew a cafe, I need to draw this person here who ordered the coffee and is drinking it. And this taught me more about myself. Firstly, it begins without articulation. You just look at something and you're interested, you find it curious. So if you walk through a city, you observed a bunch of things, maybe you took pictures of a bunch of things on camera, but there is a filter here. You take a picture already with the idea of is this thing worth taking a picture of worth to whom, to me or to someone else? You might think, is it something worth sharing on Instagram? So again, you immediately externalized to outside standards. Is this worth sharing on Instagram? Therefore, if it's not, I don't need to notice it. I don't need to take a picture of it. But as an artist, I was spending more and more time just without explicitly articulating it, just trying to discover what excites me. If I looked at something, I would tell myself, okay, give it 10 minutes and let's draw it. And in the process of drawing it, I would discover what I find beautiful about it. And therefore, in the process of this repeated exercise, I would find out these are the things that I find beautiful. And this made me a better person over time. And I found this such a useful exercise. So I did it more and more. I did this project called 30 days of Chicago, every day, new side of Chicago and every day a drawing. And I kept going after that even like I just kept drawing more and more and more things. And I posted something on Reddit on the Chicago subreddit that I sat in this place and I saw the beautiful skyline of Chicago here it is. And somebody reached out and said, do you sell prints? And this was a very crazy moment for me, because up until this moment, I was thinking of myself as a cartoonist or a comic artist. And the idea was that even if I draw well, the thing will sell because I will say something witty or funny or profound next to it, there will be a word bubble, there will be a dialogue, there will be a caption. The idea that someone could want just the art for what it is did not ever occur to me. And it was it took me aback that they just literally just the drawing, you want my drawing, I just drew it. I just sat for half an hour, you want that and you will you'll pay me for it. And I sold it. And after that, I got a few requests on Instagram. And this thing kept happening. And I came to this understanding that I was in this new place. These people don't know me. They don't care that I wrote for this YouTube channel in India. They don't know that I had a blog. What are they seeing me as if I keep calling myself a writer cartoonist? They think I'm what am I talking about? They don't even understand it because they know me for sneaky art. More and more people are knowing me for sneaky art, and they don't know this other side of me. Am I now an artist? I had to kind of rationalize that this reality that if people see know me as only for my art, and they want my art and I'm selling art, do I get to use this word artist now? And I was so hesitant, like this word held all these various meanings in my head, which I felt I wasn't qualified to use. I learned to accept it over time that I guess I'm an artist slash writer. I also write but I guess primarily I draw because yeah, that's what I'm doing every day. I'm not writing every day anymore. I'm just drawing every day. And I'm getting so much out of it that I keep doing it. Then we move to Wisconsin. And suddenly I was drawing in Wisconsin and there was not those iconic sites. So there aren't photogenic things anymore. Now what do I draw? And now I discovered that now in a more concentrated form my art is telling me who I am. Because now those external things are gone. They aren't Instagram worthy sites. Hashtag Chicago can't be used. Hashtag Eau Claire or hashtag Wisconsin is what I use. Not a big hashtag. Not so many people care about it. It's not so iconic. I don't get the same likes. So those external factors of choosing this subject are gone. Now why did I draw this thing? And I realized more and more that this is about me. And this is about my artistic journey. So I started doing it from a new perspective now. Now I'm doing it because I'm in this new part of the world whose mental picture I only have from watching that 70s show when I was a kid. That's all I know what Wisconsin might be like. And I feel like such a stranger. And maybe if I draw things, I will feel a little more comfortable. The only excuse I have for sitting in this cafe for one hour, not feel awkward and out of place is if I have my sketchbook. Sketchbook was sort of holding me there. Observation was making me at that same time bond with people from a distance. Like, yeah, I ordered that coffee. They ordered the same coffee. This is how I might have sat at a cafe with a friend the way that they are sitting here. When I would go to the park in summer and I would see people sprawled on the grass and I'm enjoying the grass in the same way and I'm watching them and I'm making a drawing or something like that from a distance. It made me feel all these common things that we have. I might not have sat on the grass for an hour in the park if I didn't have my sketchbook. I would just feel self-conscious out of place and I would leave. But this sketchbook gave me the mandate to do this thing. And sneaky art became this other thing that I reached sneaky art 2.0. So this other thing was that sneaky art exists. Everywhere. In plain sight. It is sneaky. It needs you to look for it. Once you start to look at it, you see it everywhere. It has to be believed to be seen. It's not about me being sneaky anymore. It's now about me being the observer who waits patiently for these magical moments to happen. So I was looking for what I described as moments of accidental art. So when you're at a cafe and two people are talking and right behind them, someone comes to place another order at the counter and this juxtaposition of three figures happens. It's this moment, you know, these worlds have collided. Two people are at a cafe. They are talking to each other. That's two worlds colliding. And then this other person comes and just from my vantage, my point of view, they make this composition, three people, one person standing tall, two people in the foreground, and this triangle is formed just from my point of view. If I sat somewhere else, it might have looked different. But just from this point of view, it exists in this beautiful artistic moment. My job as a sneaky artist is to register this moment before it is lost. So I make it my job now to walk around and capture these moments out of the relentlessly changing flux of life in busy places. These moments of accidental art."

        "message": "So tell me about how your art itself sort of evolved through these processes like, you know, one of your newsletter posts, I came across this pro tip where you write, quote, to draw quickly begin with what is most interesting, put it in the middle, then radiate outwards for as long as you're interested. And I'll, you know, link that post, obviously from the show notes. And there's actually a video where you sort of show yourself drawing, you put something in the middle and you kind of radiate outwards at another point where you write about this phrase, which you use a lot in your posts, tiny people, and you write quote, there's a philosophy to drawing tiny people akin to phenomenology, I strip away the layers of obfuscation and distill every person to the essential lines, I remove all that separates them from me and leave only the things we universally recognize the art of tiny people brings us to the things themselves. And then you have a link to a post which explains that. So I imagine that at some level, does it then involve trying to draw less, just getting, you know, more minimal, trying to draw less trying to capture the essence. And then this also brings me to the question of, like at one level for an artist for a visual artist, there is a pressure of fidelity, how accurately am I capturing something does what I am drawing look like the real thing in front of me. But at some point, I guess this begins to shift towards just capturing the essence of it. Because what is fidelity? I mean, everybody's looking at everything in a different way. You know, what do you see of it? So how did"

        "message": "your thinking and your art evolve around all this? Yeah, yeah. So you've touched on two points of, like, these are two things that I use to inform my raw thinking. So when I got into this business of articulating myself, so when I started the newsletter, it the idea of the newsletter was that every week, I need to talk about my drawings. What do I need to say? I don't know. But I need to get better at talking about communicating my art. This was part of being in the business of selling art, which I started in Wisconsin. And we'll go into that rewind to that a little later. But the idea of phenomenology then came to me because I'm reading about these various ideas. And I read this book, which was recommended by our group, incidentally, it's called the it's called at the existentialist cafe by Sarah Bakewell. And it's a fantastic book, which introduced me to the concept of phenomenology, which is that learning to see things as they are, and not through the way that we recognize them. And this was something that philosophers did in order to, in order to see things without judgment. But I realized that this is what I do as an artist all the time. This is the way to draw difficult things to not be intimidated by what I know it looks like. So if I'm drawing someone's face, if I get into this loop in my mind of own the nose, the nose looks like this. And I run through all these images of the nose in my mind, I don't draw what is in front of me, I draw what is in my head of what a nose should look like, and my best representation of it. So I have to do what is in front of me. So I have to reject the notions of it that I had before, I have to see it very carefully, but I have to not recognize it. Therefore, I have to see the things as they are, not as I know them. And this vibed with phenomenology in a beautiful way, like I thought it was just perfect how it synced. That's why I sort of articulated it in this manner. The minimalism though, is a function of me. I don't think that is a necessary prerequisite of art. That is just me with my inclinations and my idiosyncrasies. I'm a mechanical engineer, we optimize, I want to say more with less, I am a lazy person, I optimize, I want to say more with less work. I am a sneaky artist, I have less time. So I do not have the luxury of drawing things with millions of lines. Not to mention, I want to capture what is it that I'm interested by, I want to capture transient human activity. I can't afford to take time because it is gone. And I'm going to capture it while it is there in front of me. So I needed to minimize my lines. And I needed to say more with less lines because I needed to draw those things very quickly. So the idea of starting at a point of interest was crucial. It's a case of form follows function. I'm trying to draw these things. I'm trying to draw a person who might leave any moment in a train, I don't know which stop they'll get off at, it could be the next stop. What do I need to do in order to make this not a pointless drawing? Why did I want to draw that person? I'm going to start there. This happened because I needed to draw quickly, but it therefore trained me to learn to spot what it is that caught my interest. Now I can explicitly immediately see this is what catches my interest because I've done it half a million times I've done this with people I have looked at somebody tried to draw them and they left and it was incomplete. But I could see where I started and why I started there that is a good part of my artistic process start at the point of interest and the point of greatest interest so that even if the person is lost, I have got something that I wanted. Even if it's not a complete drawing, I have got something that I wanted from it. This was it satisfied my craving of having done that drawing. So the speed is also a function of the situation. The minimalism is also a function of the situation. This idea of tiny people is a useful exercise in this. So tiny people drawings are made at traffic lights. I'm sitting in a corner cafe looking at people at a traffic intersection. 10 seconds, maybe if I'm lucky, I get 15 seconds, then they're gone. How can I capture a human form in that little time looking, starting to draw, finishing to draw and then they're gone. All of this happens and there is no time for hesitation. There isn't only instinct. Ancillary effect of this is you learn to trust your instinct. So I ask participants in my workshops to do speed drawing, not because speed drawing is an end in itself. I don't want you to be speed artists, but I need you to be quick to identify what interests you. I need you to be quick to identify over time why it interests you. And I need you to be quick at seeing. You need to see faster. You need to register more things at first glance. And that these are useful habits, whether after that you take three hours or three weeks to compose a piece, it doesn't matter. But all these skills are useful skills for you to have, to be able to zero in on what is your interest. This will make you a better artist. Don't try to draw these things that you don't want to draw. There is no single standard of art anymore. Just draw what you want to draw. You look at my tiny people drawings. There are no feet. I don't like to draw shoes, so I don't draw shoes. Their legs end as stumps, so to say. It's my style now. Style is also something that develops in this way. Style develops when we lean into these things that are our idiosyncrasies. So there's this quote that I share in my blog posts and my podcast often. It's by my favorite musician, Miles Davis. He says, once is a mistake, twice is an idea, three times is style. So we think that as creatives, our job is to erase our mistakes. By drawing with a pen, I could not erase my mistakes. By drawing quickly, I did not have the chance to think about my mistakes. I could only move forward. And by doing this again and again and again, and insisting on drawing what I care about, I developed more ideas about what is it that I like? What is it that I don't like? If I have only 10 minutes, why should I draw the things I don't like? What if I didn't draw the things I don't like? What if I only drew the things I like? Can that be a completed piece also? Let's see. I'll do it today. I'll do it again tomorrow. Let's see what happens if I do it 50 times. This is how you develop style. These ideas reiterated so many times over so many pages, never stepping back, never editing is what developed into what eventually became my style. And I honestly have thought about the word style for so many years. And I've always thought it's too late. Like you have style or you don't. Like I can't develop a style anymore. I'm too old for that. Like you have to be a genius to have your own style. And I remember the first time I was with an urban sketchers group in Minneapolis. And someone said to me that, you know, I can identify your drawing immediately you have a distinct style. And that's the first time it occurred to me that wow, I have a style. How did this happen? It came from following these first principles and which were all necessary to my inclinations and my ideas and my circumstances that that became what it became. And that led to tiny people that led to understanding what draws me to tiny people. So the word Sonder, the ideas of existentialism, even the quote by by Sartre about hell is other people. That's such a beautiful, insightful quote. And it's"

        "message": "so important to me how that works. Yeah, thinking about style is interesting. Like just thinking aloud it strikes me that look at one level, all of us are exactly the same. You know, what appear to be differences between us are differences of happenstance in terms of slight tweaks in our genetic code. And, you know, the circumstances around us, the small differences in nature and nurture, as it were. And therefore, it could be argued that these differences might appear as weaknesses, because they don't fit in with whatever, you know, the average view of the world is. But see, in another way, they are what make us unique, perhaps by accident, but they are the style. You know, this chess tournament called Tata India, just got over in Calcutta, in fact, your home city, your hometown, and your home city, sorry, I shouldn't call it a town, Bengalis everywhere will be mad at me. Omito mito, half Bengali, we thought you're one of us. The Blitz section was won by a guy called Levon Aronian. And he was being asked about the tournament where he was trying to explain that he played badly. And he was sort of talking about how he played badly and he made so many mistakes. He was being interviewed by this guy called Sagar Shah and Sagar asked him that, do you feel bad about the mistakes you made? And he said, No, I feel not bad about the mistakes I made because they're old mistakes. They are who I am. And it's obviously a matter of concern that I'm repeating them. But I'm glad that they're old mistakes and there are no new mistakes. So the question that sprung to my mind was the one Sagar now asked that aren't you, you know, concerned that old mistakes are popping up again? And he said, No, because I know them, you know, they're familiar to me, they are who I am, in the sense that, you know, some people will have a knee problem, some people will have a back problem, you'll have back pain, once in a while, you'll learn to manage it. And you will not get worried if the back pain springs up, because it's part of you and you'll learn to manage it again. But if some new problem happens somewhere, like you get a heart attack, then that's a problem. So if it's an old weakness, I don't kind of mind it because I know how to control it, I've controlled it before, which struck me as a very profound point, because my assumption would have been that what you want to do is you want to eliminate the old mistakes. And if you make new mistakes, and you eliminate them after that, and it's a linear process. But his point is, once you settle into like, what is your style, your style is a way you think, given a form, right? And if you think in a particular way, you think in a particular way, it is who you are, I guess, in your case, some of the things which would be considered style like the minimalism or, you know, drawing stumps, because you don't like shoes, you know, others could look at them and call them weaknesses and say, Hey, you can't do hyper realistic eyes. But your style is what it is. And these weaknesses would have pushed you, I suppose, into an area of strength, where you can just take one look and kind of locate the essence of something and put that down quickly before the person gets up"

        "message": "to exactly. So in my urban sketching community, there are many artists who this is another recurring topic of conversation on the show, even in person with other urban sketchers that you can sit side by side with somebody on the same bench, look in the same direction, and draw entirely different things. Because of our inclinations, because of our skills, and because of everything being a function of the way you draw, right? So like you mentioned, I draw quickly, and somebody draws hyper realistically. So what that means to me, as an advantage part of it is that there are opportunities to draw that occur to me that do not even occur to them. I make drawings when I'm standing in a queue, like five minutes, maybe and we're done. But I'll draw quickly with a pen and I'll finish a drawing in that time. But that's not even enough time for them to get out their things, get out their tools. So that is not a situation in which they can draw. Those are not subjects they can ever capture. Only I can capture them because of the temporal nature of those transient nature of those subjects and those scenes. So there is the disadvantage, you can argue that all the realism is lost, you don't have the you're not you're not representing the reality in the same way. I think that's entirely unnecessary as an artist. And we should let's talk about the end of art as it is called by Arthur Danto who talked about it. I see the benefit as me capturing a world which is changing very quickly. And me offering something about that world in my style in my way of seeing it in my way of representing it. That does the same job like I spoke once Episode 15 of my podcast is with this person. He's a war illustrator. So he draws in war zones. He goes to Syria and with a pot of ink and watercolors and a big board with art paper on it and he sits and he paints in a war torn country in refugee camps. He went to Myanmar, he went to the Eastern European border with migrants coming in with in Kenya with the economic crisis. He was drawing and painting there. So I asked him this thing that you're doing you're doing this stuff here. What does it matter that you made a painting in Syria? Like you could have taken a photo, you could have made a video, you could have broadcasted live to everybody. You could have made a TikTok video. What does a painting matter in this time of multimedia content and instantaneous multimedia content? You took an hour to make one scene. What like why is that good? What what uses that? His answer was interesting to me. His answer was that people really look at a painting and I extrapolated based on what he said because I had had thoughts like this as well. And as a control engineer, I thought of information. So if you look at a picture, a picture has a certain amount of information, color, shadows, details, it captures everything in its point of view with an equal amount of focus. Everything is equally focused, everything is equally detailed. And we live in an age where we have access to all the pictures in the world. You can't really shock anyone with anything. Everybody's seen everything somewhere or the other. Nothing is amazing. So this, we have reached a level of jadedness with photography. It's unfortunate and it makes life very difficult for genuinely talented photographers. But people are not impressed by photos anymore, the unfortunate reality of our time. What a drawing does in this time, what does a simplistic drawing like mine or even his one hour representation, surely he doesn't have the same details as a photograph, because he's perturbed by his situation. He's not comfortable all the time. It's hot. That plays an impact on he's uncomfortable. So how does that pan out in his drawings? He's afraid of what's happening around him. How does that pan out in his details? He doesn't have the luxury of putting in the details like a fine art painting made over weeks and months. So a lot of instantaneous momentary things are captured. So it's not fully detailed. But you don't need fully detailed. What a drawing does, in my opinion, this is just me thinking out and why I feel like I've sold a lot of art in person and I speak to people who buy my art in front of me and I asked them why. And I'm building upon those that feedback as well. Is that incomplete information has a lot of value. incomplete information, which is a drawing, not a photograph, it my drawing is an ink drawing of certain shapes, no colors, no shadows, so much information is lost, taken away by me. What I'm offering is what I saw. So it is again filtered by my personality and my skill level, no feet, only stumps. So again, my inclinations, my abilities, incomplete information invites engagement. People look at it and then they fill the spaces. They look at it and they imagine the colors that will go there. They look at it and they see that Oh, this is what you saw. Why did you see this? They know that it is your perspective. It is not the objective truth, so they don't feel threatened by it. There is no insistence that this is the truth. It is implicit that this is just what I felt what I saw and how I drew it. George, my guest in episode 15, he said, every illustration is biased towards its subject. You could make a painting of Saddam Hussein, but the act of making that painting, the act of drawing the contours of someone's face, getting the colors and someone's physique and all of those things, it is an act of appreciation, not of the person, but simply of the thing in front of you, the phenomenological thing in front of you, like not the person you as you identify them. And that is what communicates to another person when they look at a painting. So this is a very powerful thing. When you get somebody to engage, you buy time. Time is the literal most powerful thing as an artist that I could want. If I can get someone to spend time with something that I drew and they really look at it, that's all. That's all that matters. There's this quote by Kandinsky. Do you know the artist Kandinsky? I've heard of him. Yeah. So he's supposed to be the father of surrealism, I think. Or maybe is it cubism? But I think surrealism. His quote is that look at a painting and and I'm paraphrasing. I don't remember the quote exactly. But he says that look at a painting and just lose yourself in it. If it has for a moment taken you out of your world, if it has it has enabled you to move in a plane that you had never seen before, what more can you ask for? The idea being that what is the purpose of art? The purpose of art is only to give us that moment where we are not in our world anymore. For a moment, we are in another world. It has these different rules. My world does not have colors. It has only lines. My world does not have precise shapes. People like that. It's a nice release from their world. It's a nice release from all this information that is always assaulting our eyes. A little less information maybe but maybe a little more to feel then. Makes it a little easier to feel if you take away all this burden of information. So I am very firmly against the concept of realism in art as this is just an artistic inclination. And this is how I feel this kind of minimalism adds value."

You know, this kind of fine art is not, we keep asking too much from it. We keep asking stupid questions like, what is he trying to say? What does it mean? These are all such wrong questions like and I learned that they are wrong questions from being an artist. And all this time I would look at fine art and modern art and what is this? Like, what is it? What's the point? Wrong question. That's not that's not the question. The job is just to experience it. To suspend judgment, again, the phenomenologist, to not see things as they are to just let it happen, whatever it is. Just this exercise has value. It doesn't matter what kind of art it is. It doesn't matter if it's hyper realistic, it doesn't take hyper realistic art. So you know, like people like Renoir, people like impressionists, not hyper realistic anymore, but someone like Monet. So I was in Chicago, I was lucky enough to see some of the best art in the world, Van Gogh and Monet and Rembrandt and Seurat who did pointillism. And it's a different kind of appreciation. You look at it from 50 feet away, it looks like something you come closer and closer and closer and the resolution breaks because now you can see the brush strokes. So the shapes aren't consistent. Now you can see it as a mess of color. And now you can understand it as that and then you move away again and suddenly those shapes resolve into things that you recognize. So it's an experience how you like it. Van Gogh is so important to me, not only for his art, but just for the persistence of the artist. He had colors in his mind that he was seeing that were not real. He was seeing compositions that were not real. He was seeing stars behave in a way that is not real. And he was showing it to us in that way. This job, the way the artist brings you into their world. One of the artists really important to me is MC Escher. And Escher played tricks with you. He represented these amazing mathematical concepts in just graphical prints, woodcut prints, the amount of work that takes. And he's not even a mathematician. The concepts that he's talking about, the things you understand when you become a student. So I sort of became a student of art in a sense in this way. I've never studied it. I don't know these movements of art that exist. And I don't, I can't tell you cubism from Surrealism or any of that, Dadaism, etc. I have no idea. But I just know that I look at this thing, it looks interesting. Let's try and find out what this is about. I look at this guy and Egon Schiele is a tragic, interesting figure. His figures, his people are have these long extended limbs and these striking poses and colors. And I want to know why, why did he do this? So I try to find out more about him. I find equal fascination in artists 300 years old and artists who I follow on Instagram today, because it's all art. It doesn't matter where it's from. If it has the power to move you, just enjoy that. Enjoy being kicked a little bit out of your out of phase."

        "message": "and be able to do it? It was really bad. Initially, I thought of it as escaping. I thought of it as getting away with something, which has a nice kick to it, it makes you feel good, you got away with something. But it's also it's not necessarily positive. You don't need to feel like that. What really changed things for me was when I discovered what urban sketchers are. So I was doing this project 30 days of Chicago. And like, it's it's incredible, like the whole serendipity of the moment serendipity is that I was walking down the street, and I saw this poster on a lamppost saying urban sketchers symposium. And that's how I found the word urban sketcher. And I googled it, and I saw this is exactly what I do. There's a hashtag, I followed it. And I followed these artists who are urban sketchers. I tried to go to the symposium. And I realized that much later, I would realize that tickets get sold out within seconds. So it's impossible if the symposium was happening in, I think, a couple of months after that. And I sort of gate crashed it. So I they have open sketch crawls, they walk around the city drawing. And I just walked along with them. And I started talking to some people, and I started looking at what they're doing. made friends, therefore, with urban sketchers. And Chicago has a super generous, super lovely chapter of urban sketchers. Urban sketching, urban sketchers are a really cool community. So the one big difference is there's no hierarchy here. All kinds of artists that I've spoken to interacted with who are fine artists otherwise, and also urban sketchers have said this, I've confirmed this for me that usually in art circles, people are protective of their styles, people are protective of what they do, they're not so welcoming to outsiders that are gatekeepers, essentially, you have to prove your worth to them. But in this community, there is no such thing for various reasons, there is no such thing. And anybody speaks to anybody, anybody learns from anybody, the teacher becomes a student, the student becomes a teacher for various things. As I had the opportunity to do myself, like I was a instructor at urban sketching seminar in Chicago later. And one of the most prominent urban sketchers of the global community was one of my students in it. And I felt so self conscious the whole time. But she said lovely things about what I how I spoke to her and how I taught and later she would be a guest on my podcast as well. So once I was with these urban sketchers, and I saw somebody who is putting out a whole, you know, watercolor palette on the ground on the road, sitting down on the road with their sketchbook, and a jar of water and these brushes, everything laid out. And it just seemed so silly that I was nervous about having a sketchbook and a pen. Like, again, I needed permission. They gave me permission to do this, they told me it's okay. You can do this, really, really great artists do this. And then I started thinking that, of course, this is what Van Gogh must have done. Like how else did he paint in the fields like he didn't take a photo and go back. He sat there with his things and he painted on the fields. How did Rembrandt paint windmills? What will he do? Of course, he had to stand there and do it like there's nothing weird about standing and looking and making art. This is how art is made. And observation of the world is not copying this idea that I was copying and I was not an artist also fell away with that. So I gave myself this mandate to do it that I am allowed to be outdoors, I am allowed to look at people and to draw. Nonetheless, at that time, I was still very conscious of it because I just I don't want to explain. And everybody who has ever asked me what I'm doing, whether they've come up from behind at a cafe or I draw at concerts. So someone I drew the musicians and somebody looked and they asked me what I'm doing. It's always appreciative. It's always positive comments. People react positively to the act of drawing or painting. They react in a way again, this is an important differentiator from photography, photography. Again, if you think of information, the way it captures everything, it is an intrusion. It is perceived as an invasion of privacy. There are ideas around how you can take photos of people, whether you can share it or not. And they are valid ideas because you are really capturing their image. In a sense, that old idea, the onset of photography that you are losing a part of your soul. When someone takes a photo, I can see it making sense in a twisted way in this. But a drawing is always perceived as an appreciative act, as a gesture of appreciation. There's no evil intent. There's no nastiness involved in making a drawing of someone. And so I always got positive comments. Nonetheless, as a person, I just don't want to explain even the nice things. Just the process of being like, oh, this is why I do it. Oh, I'm an artist. And I this is what I do. I call myself sneaky artist. It's just a conversation I would rather not have. I try to not speak to people. This is odd from a podcaster's point of view, but I try to minimize the number of conversations I have. It's just who I am as a person. I live inside my own head and I think too much. So it's been interesting to do this while observing people. It's been interesting to want to learn about people but not speak to them. And it leads to interesting artistic effects like guests, subjects leave while I'm drawing. So somebody else comes and sits in their place. And so I've drawn half of one person and the legs of the other person. That kind of stuff happens on trains. It happens a lot. Like I just drew the head and then they left. So okay, body from here, legs from here, hands from another place. So part of your legs are stumps as we now know. Yeah. Yeah. So it leads to interesting results. So then what am I doing? You know, am I capturing reality? Because this is not a person that existed at all, right? This person left and this is someone else's body and someone else. So this thing never happened. So there was another sense of independence that came to me when I thought and I accepted this thing that I don't need to be realistic and I can't be realistic because of the nature of my work and there's nothing wrong with that. I am capturing a sense of a place over the course of time that I spend there. So for example, I drew at a beach in Vancouver and I'm drawing 20, 30 people at the beach. And by the time I draw someone on the left, they have walked on and I move on to drawing someone on the right side of the page. The left side of the scene has changed completely. Those guys have left and gone home. Maybe other people are sitting in different poses. So I have never captured a single moment. What I have captured is a sense of that place over the time I have spent there. That moment never existed in singularity. It is an amalgamation of things. And that is a very liberating thought. It lets you do more things once you realize you don't have this burden of needing to be realistic. And realism is a thing that really, it bores me. I had ideas about it. And then I read this about this essay by Arthur Danto called The End of Art. And it's fascinating. Like, it's the whole idea is exactly what I had thought about before. And I love it when this happens, you know, like, I have conversations with podcasters also. And I like the moments not when they tell me something that I've never thought about. As much as I like the moments when they tell me something I have thought about, and then just been like, this is just me thinking what this this doesn't matter. But then they validate it. And then I give it value again, they again, give me a little bit of permission to back my own ideas. And I love those moments. So The End of Art talks about this moment when Arthur Danto, who is an art historian, art critic and philosopher, he in the 60s sees Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes. So Brillo boxes are these packaging boxes. And Andy Warhol's exhibit is literally a reproduction of that box in that same size with some other materials. What breaks Danto's mind is that how do you separate this from the real object? What makes this art but not those real boxes art? So he felt that now art has in a very particular sense, art has ended. And he tracks two narratives of art. He doesn't firstly he doesn't think of this as a bad thing. He thinks this is a great thing for art. And artists shouldn't think of this as a negative thing that all art has ended. So what am I doing? No, that's not what it is. What he calls as the first narrative of art was when art had the responsibility of representing the world. And I have thought about this, why am I not realistic? Because photography exists, why do I need to be realistic? Photography exists, and you can record record the world as it is. So I don't need to be realistic. I don't need to compete with photography. Why when they can do it, you can put a filter, it'll look artistic, do that. His thing was that for the first narrative of art was when it needed to be photorealistic, well, realistic, because photos didn't exist. And that narrative ended when photography became a thing. Now art needed to find a new purpose. And that's when all of these ideas of impressionism, cubanism, cubism, surrealism, dadaism, all of these were developed, because now what is art? Why am I drawing? Why am I painting? Can I play with perspective? Can I play with reality? What is the purpose of doing this exercise? And all these great artists delved into that. And in his opinion, that narrative ended with Andy Warhol. Because now there was no distinction between now what art is, is not about looking at it, but it's about thinking about it. So now in his words, we had reached the age of art theory. Art was art in a certain context. So he was thinking aloud and saying, if Leonardo da Vinci saw this, Brillo boxes, would he consider it art? If Michelangelo saw it, would he consider this art? No. This is art only when you take into context the art of before, and the movement of art, and then you come to this meta understanding that why can't this also be art? Sort of Andy Warhol is doing that thing that, look at these Campbell soup cans, why can't this be art, if you look at it? And this only makes sense if you think about what else has been art before. So we have entered the realm of art theory. And this he called the end of art, the end of the second narrative. And what happens now is so he distinguishes narratives from chronicles. Narratives have a purpose. They have a so like a story of anyone, it has a beginning, middle and end, it has a epic conclusion. But chronicles simply go on. My life is a chronicle, like even after a narrative of my life has gotten over the rest of my life continues. That's the chronicle. So now art has entered this phase, where it is free to be whatever it wants. It does not have a narrative bound to it. It does not have a duty to perform anymore. It can be realistic if it likes, it can be impressionistic if it likes, it can dabble in whatever direction, doing all kinds, it is completely free. It is in the chronicle stage. He's been criticized, he's got a lot of critics, because firstly, he talks only about Western art, and then he kind of rejects Eastern art and other ideas in the process. But this is a useful model. Another thing I learned from control engineering, there's this quote that I'd shared with you. The quote is that all models are wrong, but some models are useful. So these models are not completely self sufficient, comprehensive models of the world, but they can be useful within a context to understand something to work in to do something with. And this has helped me do something. So I have understood the purpose of realism, what it was, I have understood why I don't need to be doing it, and why I don't need to feel guilty about not doing it. So I can't draw eyes realistically, doesn't matter, you don't need to do it. The point is, I'm trying to communicate. And if I can communicate with two dots, I've saved a bit of time, I've saved a lot of effort, I don't have a lot of time from my viewers, they are scrolling on Instagram, I have to catch their attention. So I am allowed to do these things. And sort of this kind of studying of these rules backwards, these art theories and histories is useful, like it helps you own what you do, it helps you inform what you do. And I think it makes me a better artist, to communicate this, to write about it, to share it in my newsletter to talk about why I'm doing what I'm doing and to share like, I described my newsletter as sharing the journey of my self education. And because who am I to teach right, like I'm no one to talk about art, but I am allowed to share my journey."

        "message": "Sharing the journey of my self education is also actually how I describe the seen and the unseen and because everybody's trying to educate themselves, I guess that's why journeys like the Stryker chord, you know, one of the things that has led to my unease with a fair amount of art is that you it seems like you can only appreciate it in a particular context. And that is often a context of some kind of theory or politics that goes along with it. For example, you know, Marcel Duchamp's fountain, right, which is basically for those who don't know in 1917, Marcel Duchamp did a sculpture called Fountain, which is basically a urinal and it's signed Armat. And the point is that that work of art is only meaningful for someone who's steeped in the theory and in the context and in that particular narrative. It doesn't mean anything in and of itself, like if I come across that somewhere, I would just think, okay, today I've hydrated enough, let's give a little back to the world. But it would not strike me as anything other than that. Whereas I think there is, you know, and I'm just thinking aloud again, that there is some art and I don't want to make a value judgment comparing these two, but there is some art which will stand on its own. As we spoke earlier, as you know, going by Kandinsky's quote, you can just look at and immerse yourself in. I mean, a lot of poetry certainly does that for me. I don't need to know literary theory to fall in love with a short story or be greatly moved by a poem, even when I don't know what it means. So what are sort of your, I mean, you've already spoken about definitions of art and, you know, the thoughts provoked by this essay you mentioned, but in general, what are your sort of thoughts on that? Like, what do you consider the best art that you've encountered? And did it take prior education to appreciate it for what it is, or does it just stand alone"

I'll show it to Da Vinci and he'll think this is not art, like you have to, there's so much more to do, like you haven't completed it yet. Right."

        "message": "art. Yeah, that's a fair point. So I think about a lot of institutional ideas in this way, like, for example, I had this idea about this thought about philosophy, for example, that you have someone like Nietzsche writing about what would become existentialism and you have Sartre writing about it. What are they doing? Are they leading a movement? Are they articulating a movement or a philosophy? Should we call them the inventors of existentialism, for example, or somebody else as the inventor of something else or are they observers? So how many people read Sartre then and how many people explicitly read him and absorbed that philosophy and then became like this? And how much was it an observation of the time that he was in and the way that the art and the culture and the behavior post-World War Two or during the last years of World War Two was expressing itself. So we give things these names, right? And we give these movements, these leaders, but like, are they leaders or are they simply like leaders in the sense of creators or are they leaders in the sense of observers who articulated something? So that's a very crucial point to me. How many people read Schopenhauer? How many people read Heidegger? Like very few people must have read Heidegger. He's a very important philosopher. So is he just a really important philosopher to other philosophers or did he have something useful to say for all of us? If he did, certainly it wasn't communicated by him to all of those people. So I like the idea of philosopher as Isaiah Berlin kind of pointed it out by saying that I'm a historian of ideas. And this is the reason why I personally started to read about existentialism and Nietzsche and all of these other people also that I want to see the chronology of ideas over time, the best ideas that people came up with, like, we are going through an era right now where there's a resurgence of stoicism. And stoicism is 2200 years old, like you tell someone that, and that's one of those mind exploding moments that somebody, a Roman general 2200 years ago said this thing that matters to me today, the continuity of human experience. And what has kept that stoicism alive over 2200 years? Is it Seneca? Is it that Marcus Aurelius who wrote it? No, it's not that. How many people would have read him? All of these things are a part of like, at least I think so, like they're a part of humankind. And philosophers and artists, and these are just people who see it, and they share it. But these notions of rebellion, whether cubism or surrealism is rebellious, they come from tapping into the psyche of the community and the culture that they're in. So these things are incepted in this culture by the vast masses of humanity. And then one person comes along and he represents it on a canvas in one way. But I don't think they invent it. So again, when I think about whether people would understand it then as art or whether they would just see this person is just making a urinal. It's a bit of both. Like surely some people will see it as that. But it sort of implies just that art has a bit of a learning curve sometimes, you do need to know a bit of context, you do need to be a bit erudite about it. I don't think that's a bad thing. And so this kind of is counterintuitive to how I practice. And you would think that if you're tearing down institutions, why won't you tear down institutions? But there's a bit of both in me. Like I feel like curators and institutions do an important job. They do articulate these things. Sometimes after the time, we needed these people for Van Gogh, for example, like, otherwise, maybe we wouldn't have known about him today. Like possibly, I don't know. Maybe we wouldn't have known. But there's a bit of both. Like I feel like when people talk about this kind of art, and they say that, oh, but you know, I don't understand it. And there is this other stuff that I understand. And therefore, this is better than that other stuff. I don't know, like, I feel like that learning curve and that delayed reward at the end of it also has its own value. But it's not maybe a good entry point. And it's never good if that is the art and other things are not art. So we are in this beautiful place now where so many things can be art. And there is no, you can't be a gatekeeper, because there isn't one gate to one thing, you can be a gatekeeper to a certain kind of knowledge. And that knowledge can still have value. But there is other knowledge also."

The question is that it's much more possible that because of him, there are many Van Goghs who didn't get discovered. I mean, I just feel that this notion of depending upon elite curators and educators and theorists is very dicey. Because if we lived in that world, honestly, I don't think you would have come up and I don't think I would have come up like if you had people curating podcasts and deciding what is kosher and what is not and what is worth listening to and what is not worth listening to and there's no other access to the masses.

And I'll share another revelation, which I think is as startling and which you might have come upon, but will certainly come upon later, even if you haven't now, which struck me when you spoke of, you know, they start to believe Stoicism has been around for 2200 years, as if that is a long time. And the realization is that time is very short, or time is short, because we shouldn't use the word very. The older I get, the more I realize how quickly time passes. Someone commented on Twitter the other day, and I found it very perceptive comment that when I speak of, you know, when I speak of 30 years ago, and this is a person who commented when I speak of 30 years ago, I'm thinking of 1970. And then I suddenly realized, wait a second, it's 1991. You know, time passes much faster than we realize it. Before we kind of move on with this linear narrative from which we keep deviating, I'm actually going to do a flashback and go back to a phrase that you use earlier, and ask you to sort of elaborate on that, which is control engineering, where you spoke about how control engineering felt so natural to you, you immediately got it. And how even after you cease to be, you know, an engineer per se, it's dominated the way you look at everything and why it's so important for you. I wanted to go into this a little bit more, because it's very fascinating. And I also wonder if it has something to do with a bent of mind that involves getting meta a little bit about things getting to the first principles about, you know, like I remember, last year, I was telling somebody something about podcasting, who doesn't podcast or I mean, person who just has a Facebook presence and rants about many things there. And I was telling him about podcasting. And obviously, in my excitement of all that I had learned, I was harrowing Gyan and at one point, he said, that is so academic who listens to the pseudo bullshit. And I was like, wait a minute, I'm actually a successful practitioner at this shit, right. And part of the reason I think the show gets better is because I try very deeply to get meta and think about all of these things, the importance of listening, how you structure a conversation, you know, how you get the kind of flow that you get. And I sense that you look at things the same way in the sense you're trying to break things down. Why do I see what I see? Why is my art the way my art is just that very profound point you made about your weaknesses eventually turning into your style about constraints giving you freedom. So tell me a little bit about control engineering. And if this point is separate from that, tell me a little bit about this mindset that you have, and whether it's natural to you, or you worked at developing it, this mindset about just getting to first principles, taking that step back and getting a little meta."

        "message": "Yeah, I think they're both the same thing. So the reason why I'm fascinated by control engineering is because it offers a way to do this. And there are reflections of it everywhere in my life. And so control engineering breaks the whole world into systems. So once you're a control engineer, you see everything as systems, and systems which have inputs and outputs, and they function a certain way. And by intelligently understanding or manipulating these inputs, and studying the outputs, you can understand what's why did that input turn into this output. So therefore, this system must be doing this, this, this, this, this, oh, this system multiplies all numbers by five, or this system does two x plus five, or this system adds so and so feedback, and it does this and that, and it turns this into energy. And with a 30% effect, you figure out these black boxes. And the way to do that the way to identify systems that are black boxes is a very fascinating thing. What are the structures that we have that we can put here and see if this holds true? Oh, this doesn't work? How do we why don't we try this kind of structure and see if this fits? Where did these structures come from? How did we learn about them, this idea of isolating variables and controlling certain variables and then seeing how something works? It's a very nice way to look at the world. And I have an inclination to look at my world in this way. And therefore, I appreciated what I learned from doing this. So I'll give you an example of why this was already something that I was thinking about from one of my favorite authors of all time is Kurt Vonnegut. And one of my favorite books by Kurt Vonnegut is Cat's Cradle. And in Cat's Cradle, there is a fictional religion called Bokononism talked about by the prophet Bokonon and who lives on this island. And at the start of the book, Bokonon says that. This religion is for any person who does not understand how a religion can be founded on useful lies will not like this book either. Useful lies. So there is another quote in the start of this book in which he says something like we all live by the FOMA that make us happy and healthy and kind and wise. And FOMA is a fictional word amongst many in the book, which means harmless untruths. So we all live by these white lies that make us happy and healthy and wise and kind. And this is the basis of all religion. It's a bunch of suspended delusions that we agree upon, whether with others or whether just inside our own minds. But they help us make sense of our world. The quote that I said before that was shared with to me by a control engineering professor in a lecture was all models are wrong, but some models are useful. All models are wrong means all models are simplifications of the truth. They are not the truth. So something as simple as Hooke's law of elasticity, that extension X is equal to a constant. So if you apply a force F, it is equal to a constant multiplied by X, which is the amount of deviation in that elastic deviation. So this is not true because it is a it's a linearized simplification of a nonlinear reality. There is many, many more forces that are little, little deviations. Many things come together, but we can make a useful equation. By within certain bounds, thinking of it as linear F is equal to KX and it is super useful. It is the basis for a lot of design, limitless number of applications. Similarly, all of these basic laws like F is equal to MA and E is equal to MC squared, all of these are simplifications of very, very deep and profound things. In a sense, they are all wrong because they are not exactly true, but some of them are useful and therefore we should not discard them. We should think about things don't have value only if they are absolutely true. Things can have useful purpose in our lives, even when we know they are not true, simply by our understanding how to use them within a certain context, therefore religion, therefore the role of fiction in life. And you see, you see the conflict of that so much, right? Like if you tell someone that a certain epic or a certain religious book is fiction and they take so much offense because fiction means it's not true and only true things have value. And that's such a narrow-minded point of view that stories don't have value. The most valuable things in the world are stories. We all live, Elon Musk has a story of himself. He doesn't have the truth of himself out in the world. This is the source of his power. All religions and all prophets have stories of themselves. Nobody really wants the truth. They want a nice story. All political leaders have nice narratives and stories around them. And we believe them even if we sort of think it's not true. We know it's not true, but we know that our story is stronger than that guy's story. Our story will win. So let's stick with our story. So this understanding is very profound. It applies in so many ways to all of life and control engineering sort of was the scientific way for me to appreciate it. I heard it and I thought, look, this applies to art. This applies to history. This applies to someone like Gandhi, for example, right? A person with many flaws, so many detailed nuances that I don't know about. And there are so many people who don't know about it, right? But if believing in the myth of Gandhi as a peaceful leader makes someone peaceful, makes them believe in nonviolence and not hurting other people, makes them believe positively about the value of bringing people along and making a movement, isn't that lie way more useful than the truth of maybe he's sexist. Maybe he's casteist. Who cares? Like what a useless truth. Like you could, someone could make an argument that let's discard that truth. Let's forget. Let's erase it from public memory because that lie is just so much more useful in making us human. And it may be through this deification is of more use to society. And it's something I think about a lot, like you are wedded to the truth as engineers. You think that you're going for objective truth, but like, what does, what does the truth matter? Like engineering and science is just such a small part of the world. Math is such a small, like tangible things are such a small part of the world. And we engineers, we think, and this is the age of the tech bros, like we think that we understand everything because everything can be broken into equations and creativity will be broken into equations so that AI will become creative. But we don't appreciate how many things are intangible. Most of the world, most of reality is intangible. Most of reality is only inside our heads. It doesn't actually matter what someone did to us. What matters is how we feel about them. And that's how we behave with them. So control engineering helped me to make sense of all of these things, incomplete information, but can be still useful if you make it useful. And I've talked about all the ways that it has helped me in non-engineering ways, but it has also made, it made me a better engineer. It helped me find out so much about these complex things that are designed. So for example, I worked on this system, which was like a creator's tray. Like suppose you have glasses on it and it's automated though. It's not actually being held by somebody. What if you pushed it? How can you design a system that will not let the glasses fall? It will absorb the shock and it will react appropriately like the way this lazy boy chair does like dampening and spinning action. So just those things, playing with things and figuring out how they work. It's such a powerful, empowering thing to do. And I just love that thing. And education by my goal with going to Delft to study was I wanted to be a real engineer and they made me a real engineer. Like they gave, they empowered me. And like that is just, it feels super great to have had that education. And even if I don't quote unquote use it, all knowledge is always there."

They can either use a lazy boy or they can use a green soul gaming chair, which I have an extra pair of. And I mean, I use a green soul gaming chair, but the second chair is a recent addition. And so Nishant is the first guest to be offered that option. And of course, you know, being from Calcutta, a half Bengali like me can relate. He chose a lazy boy. So and the Calcutta boys are lazy boys for Calcutta boys are something in the air. It's good to be lazy. It's good to be lazy. So a couple of things, a couple of observations. You know, I love that quote. Firstly, I think I've actually quoted it earlier on my show. And I first heard it from you, which is all models are wrong, but some models are useful. Fantastic quote. And the world is complex. In fact, the cliche on my show that we all contain multitudes of Whitman quote is a subset of that, of the world being complex. And I completely get that, that we can never really get at the truth. Nevertheless, I actually think in a historical context, and I've been discussing this on my show a lot, that the truth nevertheless has value. Like I know you were just thinking aloud when you spoke of Gandhi and, you know, can we not speak of the sexism and casteism and can we just speak of the nonviolence and the satyagraha. But I think part of the mistake that we made post independence was taking exactly that view. That let's kind of whitewash the things that have gone wrong in our history. Kapil Komiriddi spoke about this very eloquently in his episode with me, Manu Pillay agreed with him when he came on the show recently. And the truth is what happened post independence was that our historians to avoid conflict in present day society decided to paper over earlier periods of time when there was violence by the Mughals and so on and so forth. And Komiriddi's contention is that now there is a backlash in the other direction. And you should just have let it play out and let society resolve its own problems, we are"

Like Gandhi was this or that, you know, all of these guys, you know, you're Gandhis and Vajpayees and Nehru's and Savarkar's contain multitudes, I think discussing the people are is irrelevant, we can discuss ideas, you know, Gandhi got it completely wrong on railways and doctors, both of which he was against, Gandhi got it completely right on the means being more important than the ends and the importance of peaceful non resistance, there is so much to learn from that. And I agree with you that we should kind of look at the learnings and discard his bad ideas while seeing them for bad ideas and acknowledging them that he had them."

So all of these equations, all of these systems work within variables being within these boundaries, this variable in this boundary, this and that.

But what a pointless thing to do, like a waste, like, so my grandmother is religious. It makes her a nicer person, and in that little context of her life, religion is a good thing.

        "message": "place. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. That's why I think as one goes along with life and realizes that, listen, fundamentally, life is meaningless and sad and ends in death, and we need to choose our delusions to get by and some people have chosen religion and it's a convenient way to kind of get by and we need to be kind and appreciate that I think there is also this balance between fidelity to the truth and kindness. And sometimes I think in some situations, you just need to not argue and just be kind to the person. Though I think that this invocation to kindness is often used by some people in ideological context as appealing for, you know, when they don't want to talk about the truth, that don't argue with what I believe, I will be offended and you have to be kind. So I think that is another extreme we kind of should not go to. Just continuing down this sort of control engineering mindset where you realize that perfection is impossible, because, you know, all models are false, you can only get useful with it. Does that also then lead to that notion of satisficing like, you know, one thing that I speak about in my course is that whenever you do something, there is that tradeoff between getting it done and getting it right. And my point always is that, as an artist, don't think about getting it right, just think about getting it done. And you can get it right later. But especially when it comes to a first draft, just get it done. The important thing is to get it done. And you could also talk about this as a dichotomy between perfection and production. And the irony here is that the route to getting it right is to get it done again and again. And the route to perfection is through repeated production as you get better and better and better. And therefore, is it a good quality for an artist to satisfies like satisfies is a word that is combination term combination of the two words satisfy and satisfies. And what it means is you're satisfied with something that suffices, that you're not aiming for perfection, that something that is good enough, you're happy to put it out there and just move on. And it seems like by the nature of your work, the sneaky art, you've been forced by circumstances into satisficing all the time, where you don't have time, the person will get up and go, you just got to get what you can and then move on. So do you feel that there is sort of deeper artistic value in this, for example, do you think about this? Do you feel that this is a constraint or do you feel that by happenstance, you've been forced into thinking this way, and it's actually a good way to think, you know, like you described earlier that, let's say that there is someone who wants to do hyper realistic stuff, and that person is standing in a queue, and that person cannot take out their material, but you can you're always drawing, right? And to me, that seems like a massive, massive, massive privilege, that at any point in time, and I will tell my readers that he made a sketch of me while we were talking. So just just imagine. So what are your thoughts on this?"

        "message": "Yeah, yeah. So I have I put myself in this situation where my perfectionism could not get in my way. Choosing to draw with a pen, choosing to draw quickly, choosing to draw things that are transient, all of these things, perfectionism could not enter the picture. It's not a player in this game anymore. And I put it in in front of myself consciously, because I understand what my tendencies are. I know what my evils are. This is the mistake I always make, and I need to not make it. So I needed to be in a situation where perfectionism was not an option for me. So I often think about this idea of the things we call constraints. So it's a constraint that I have only one pen. I can't use another color. I can't use another line with thickness. I can't do this. I can't do that. I can't represent so many things. It's a constraint that I'm drawing quickly. That is this idea that you should be free to do your best work. You should have options so you can make the best choice. But more and more, I find that the best work does not come from these things like the best work comes when there is a deadline, for example, because you have to finish you finish, otherwise the best work just stays in your head, it never comes down on paper. Similarly, constraints in various forms. If you just change your perspective a little bit, they bring you great freedom. Having the constraint of only one fountain pen, not a pencil meant the freedom to finish many sketches. Having the constraint of time meant the freedom to draw this thing that is only there for this little time. Having the constraint of being sneaky meant that I am not anymore drawing in conspicuous positions. Think about what a conspicuous spot is. If you're in front of the Eiffel Tower, that's a conspicuous spot. It's a conspicuous spot because everybody else is there. Because everybody wants to take a photo from that angle. Therefore, it is the most photographed and the most often seen view of the Eiffel Tower. By being sneaky, by imposing sneakiness on my art, I cannot take that option. I will circle around it two or three times. I will look for spots where nobody is. Therefore, I will look for spots from where pictures have not been taken or not likely to be taken as much. I will therefore find something fresh. It has given me the freedom to discard my first point of view, my second choice, my third choice, and often my fourth choice, and therefore discover something that others have not. It has given me the freedom to find something original, quote-unquote, because nothing is really original, but it has given me the freedom to find something that others don't and to show something that other people are not showing. So I often think about this thing, about constraints and what we call constraints and why we try to run from constraints, because constraints have given me so many different freedoms. I'm only going to draw in this spot, and once I leave, I am not going to touch this sketch again. Therefore, there is this essence of that moment here. Some of these are incomplete, quote-unquote, they're not finished works, but they say where they are. They are an honest record of that time, and that is a quality that they have because they are never touched upon again. And that is a quality that very few other things can have. And as we explore this field of being creative entrepreneurs, being artists who have to create this brand, all of these identities matter because all of these identities are useful things to add value around your work."

        "message": "So you mentioned the term creative entrepreneur, and that's kind of where I want to go next, because it strikes me that in this modern age, there is much that is exciting about this modern age. But one thing that I feel a little unease at is that a creator is also expected to be an entrepreneur, in the sense he's supposed to be the seller of his work, the entrepreneur of his brand, be the guy pushing himself, like your art in the way that you actually make it, that you produce it is sneaky. But the selling is the opposite of that, you've got to go out on a limb and figure out how to get publicity and how to get your art out there. Now it turns out that at one level, of course, this is something that you figured out how to do well, whether it came naturally to you, or you worked at it, but you figured out how to do well, but many people don't. And the you know, and it's kind of unfair that artists also have to be entrepreneurs in this way, in this day and age, though it is possible to, you know, that things can work out and you can become successful without thinking of it in an entrepreneurial way. But that takes a certain amount of luck. For most artists, you're constantly working, working, working to get your brand out there to get opportunities to figure out how to scale to figure out how to even gather the first 1002 fans as it were. So tell me of your journey in that regard, because you've already described how you want to be a writer, you give up that other pyramid of engineer, PhD, whatever, to be a writer. And then you discover drawing and is incredibly satisfying. But from there, to making it a commercial proposition to sort of actually make money from it and make it commercially viable, what was that journey like? How did your thinking evolve? You know, what are the different routes that you explored?"

        "message": "So I registered sneaky art as a business when I was living in Wisconsin. So I have business taxes that I collect and I pay as a business and I have business costs and more formalized setup that happened at that time. And I did it then because in Wisconsin, in this town of 80,000 people called Eau Claire, Wisconsin, right in the middle of the state, 90 miles away from the nearest city, there is this artist's market in every Saturday of summer, next to the farmer's market. So in the park where everybody congregates every morning from 6am to 12pm, a bunch of artists set up stalls and sell their wares. And having spent a year there, I decided now I want to sell my art. So as non sneaky as it gets, I have set up a stall with my prints and I am sitting and people are passing by who are here to buy vegetables or to buy cheese or something. And they stop and they look at my prints and they ask me what these are. And I tell them, it pushed me way out of my comfort zone, like firstly talking to complete strangers and telling them what I do and why they should care for it. Then putting a dollar value to my work, and then convincing, like the act of making a sale, there is some element of convincing, there is a pitch, even if it is something you give reluctantly, or you don't at all, but there is a pitch that needs to be made in some way, whether your art does it for you, or you talk a bit at least helps to talk. But I had to do these things which were uncomfortable. But these things have immense value. So from speaking to people who are there to buy vegetables, not here to buy art, and getting them to buy art, I learned things. Firstly from showing my work to people as a commercial artist, so I'm here to sell. With that in mind, when I showed my work to people, I set up my stall in a very formal way. Like I made sure I thought about the experience of somebody passing by, and the experience of somebody who decided to stop and walk in, what would they see next, where would they look, what should they be able to pick up, I thought about these things. So what that does is, it makes me think about my art not as the artist. I have to externalize it, I have to look at it dispassionately. Why should they look at this piece, why should they look at that piece, is this going to be interesting to someone, why would they be interested in this, would it be simply because I enjoyed drawing it, that can't be the criteria. This is a useful exercise if you're an artist to get into. This is a useful exercise if you're a creative to get into. Even as a writer, you'd love your writing maybe, but you should think about the other person who's going to read it and why should they give a damn, because there is so much they can do. You can buy excellent cheese in Wisconsin, you don't need to buy my art. I had to price my art a certain way, I had to put that dollar value, and I thought about what is it that I want to be doing here, what is my objective here, what do I want to learn from it, what is a win, is a win a dollar amount, tough, tough to put a dollar amount and because you don't know what's good, what's bad, I can settle $200 is a great amount if I make that much sale. But what is that, how do I know that's good. So I have to have some notion of something that is good to me. So I set this benchmark for my first year, first summer that I was selling art, that I want to sell art for as cheap as possible. What I want to do is, so controlling variables here, right? So I want to make as many sales as I can. And I want to control the various variables around the sale. One variable is, I don't want to spend so much money. What is their budget? They are not here to spend money on art, right? So I had to think of the minimum amount of money that someone would take out of their pocket without a second thought. What is that number in this place? It is contextual. This is a rural place in Wisconsin, it's not Chicago City, Chicago, that number might be $20, India, that Bombay, that number might be 200 rupees, Calcutta, that number might be 100 rupees, Wisconsin, that number as I perceived it was $5. So my cheapest drawing needs to be $5, my most expensive drawing can't be more than $20. With this idea, I am controlling for hesitation, financial hesitation. Now this is not a factor anymore in this game. What is a factor? Now the factor is only do I want it? Now I get to examine, do people want my drawing? I am not pricing anyone out. Anybody can buy this. $5, anybody can spend here and if they like my work, they might not buy the $20 piece but they will want to go away with the $5 piece. Once you have them, you have them. And they want to do something now because once they are interested, they actually want to spend money. They don't want to leave empty handed. It makes people feel bad. It's part of the psychology of spending money that you want to do something now. So $5. What this did was, now I started to think, what is the space that my art can occupy in someone's life? What is a $5 piece of art? It can't be a piece on a wall. It has to be a small print, maybe. How do people use small prints? Is it something that looks like a card? Maybe a sticker for their laptops? Is it something that maybe they can put in their wallets? So what art of mine does that purpose? I'm now thinking about my art in terms of how it means to someone in their life. $5 is what they pay for it. $5 is not what it means anymore. Now that it is there, why would they want it in their life? This is a useful exercise for all creatives also. Think about what place do you occupy? After one season of selling art in this way, I sold hundreds of prints this way. I got many commissions. Lots of people were super happy to buy it. I sold stickers. So a bunch of students came one time who didn't want to spend even $5. For $1, I gave them 2-3 stickers. And they bought sets of stickers, not because they could only afford it. So somebody ended up spending $10 on stickers. Not because that's the only thing they can afford. But this is the way they want that art. So I learned that art has many final forms. I made a drawing in a sketchbook. Now it can be so many different things. It can be a print. It can be a print on a wall, like on fine art paper. It could even be a fabric print. It can be a sticker. It can be a digital piece that somebody buys to make as a wallpaper or a phone wallpaper or something. All of these are various ways that people engage with art in their lives. We often dismiss people who don't buy fine art as Philistines or whatever. They don't appreciate things. But more people appreciate art than that. It is incumbent on the artist to think about the way that their audience engages with art. It is not the right approach, in my opinion, to make the art and then be like somebody owes you a sale. Somebody owes it to buy from you because you are so creative, you have done your job. That is irresponsible. That is, it's, I don't think in any field of work that is appreciated. But in terms of art, it's almost made into a virtue because people don't want to engage with this commercial side, which is ugly and demeaning. And for a long time, it's been that way because we haven't had the tools of commercial engagement in our hands. Right. Like somebody like Da Vinci and all the other big artists, they needed patrons at a time in Florence, in Italy, they needed the Medici family to patronize all these artists who became fantastic, great artists. So you need to please this person. Then he will put your work somewhere that hopefully other people can see it. And then maybe it lasts the test of time, blah, blah, blah, becomes a thing. But so over the last 20 years, that thing changed for us because of the internet. First there was no money. You can put your art there. There's no money. You can put it on Flickr, whatever, whatever. Then you can put it on Facebook. And then you can make these business pages. And then you can put it on Instagram. And now suddenly you have affiliate marketing. And suddenly you can reach an audience and build an infinite audience potentially. And you can get money from a few people who decide to endorse you affiliates. So brands and corporations who like, Oh, I'll give you a pen. I'll give you you only use my sketchbook, for example, use only my art supplies, my paints and tag us and we will then give you so much so much. And that have that works for a lot of artists. And now we have reached a point where even the means of monetization are distributed. You can gather small funds and micro payments from various various hundreds of fans. This is very freeing. This is super liberating because like you mentioned with the blogs, for example, now it's not 800 words or 1000 words or 5000 words, it can be 50 words, it can be microfiction, it can be haiku. If you have the fans, if you have the people who care, then you get to define the terms. Every artist should love that reality. You are not bound to make a fine art piece on canvas, which is eight feet tall or something like that. You can do whatever you want. You can make a product out of the piece, you can make a product out of a cool photo of the piece, which is better than the piece itself. The experience of looking at art on Instagram is the experience you're offering the thing that you are offering the experience of watching you draw through a time lapse video of which I post many myself. That experience is the product you are offering. Suddenly the final piece that I drew and how it turned out is irrelevant. Just watching me draw set to some cool music on reels or tick tock. That is the product. I'm giving you that beautiful 30 seconds. You can replay it again and again and forever and enjoy it. And many people do that. They watch these videos again and again, again, huge freedom for the artist. You can do whatever you want and you can reach people who are okay with that. These freedoms come with the responsibility now that now you have to think about why they should care. Because if you can do whatever you want, anybody else can also do whatever they want, right? Why should they look at your art and not the art of some person in say, the other side of the world? If you live in Vancouver, why shouldn't they look at someone's art in Australia, like it's all Instagram. There is a fantastic artist I follow from Australia who does beautiful time lapse videos, huge audience way bigger than mine. And of course, people will follow her like it's all the same, right? I'm competing with her in a sense, you could, I could think that and then I could be like, oh, that's so wrong. But that's, that's not how this works. The responsibility that comes to me is that, how do I differentiate myself? I get to do that. This is also a freedom I have and but it's part of my responsibilities. I have to brand myself, I have to talk about myself in a certain way. Why should someone care about me? Is it because I'm the greatest artist in the world? So am I making it my business to compete with 5 million artists on Instagram? Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Michelangelo never had this kind of competition. They had to compete for the attention of one patron or two patrons or 10 patrons only with the people who are in that town, or somebody comes from outside. That's it. That's the competition. Right? They didn't have, nobody has ever had to compete with so many people."

        "message": "less. Yeah, right. But if he makes it his job to be on Instagram and thinks that now he's in competition with everybody else who's on Instagram, then that's a losing battle again. It does not mean that you're not good. It does not mean that you don't deserve to make money off your art. Surely the point is not that one person should make money off art, like only the person who's right on top. So you have to demolish this whole structure. Why you is not about just how good you are, because that's a race you're not going to win. Why you is a question now of other things. Maybe it has to do with how you made your art. Maybe it has to do with who you are. Why should somebody in Versova care about an artist in Versova and not an artist in Australia? You have to give them that reason. They will like to talk, know an artist in Versova. Actually it's true. They would. But it is your responsibility to develop those reasons. It is your responsibility to woo them and to do the communication job that does this. So with these tools of monetization, these tools of distribution, these tools of audience outreach, comes the responsibility that now you get, you have to, you can do outreach. So now you have to do outreach. You can monetize from anybody. So now you have to think about what's going to monetize. What art do they care about? What kind of art do they care? How do they engage with art? What can you offer that somebody else can't? So there's this idea, you know, of how we should, originality, there's no such thing as originality. All of us, whether you're a writer or an artist, you're not original. You are borrowing, you are begging and stealing and copying from everybody else before you. And then you may be, if you're very lucky, you move one inch forward into something that nobody's ever done. Maybe, maybe a very tiny fraction, and then they move the whole thing forward for everybody else after them to copy that very easily. So I tell people, don't try to be original, try to be authentic. There's a very subtle difference between these two things. Authenticity is what you have that nobody else has, because it is authentic to you. Who are you? Talk like you say what your journey is. So tiny people drawings matter to people because not just because they're the best drawings of people on a street. No, there are far greater artists than me. It matters because of the story I make around tiny people. That story is unique, and that story gives value to these drawings that I make. The idea that tiny people are a non fungible moment in space and time that these people are a result of my observation from that street intersection that day while having that coffee and looking in this direction. And it can never happen again. Because those people will not be in the street at the same time dress that same way the weather, my ideas, my inclinations and my moods. Even if you bring all of those things together, maybe I'll just happen to look at different things then and draw different people. Because I drew someone and five other people passed by also that I didn't draw. Maybe I'll draw someone else. This moment can never be replicated. This drawing in this way, this collection of hundred people on this page can never ever happen again. It is from this day on this location. This creates value around what that piece is. This helps people understand the significance of that. And this is me talking because now I'm thinking about what do I think about things like existentialism phenomenology? What do I think about space and time and this idea of things coming and never repeating again? This is me talking right? This is make this makes it authentic to me that nobody else has. This gives it value. It's not about the technical skill of my drawing. So there is a lot of liberation in the idea of being a creative entrepreneur. But we get bogged down in these things that all I'll have to do things and I don't want to do things like I just want to draw and as an outsider to art, I don't have much patience for this."

You just have to flick that switch once like all the vlogs I watch, for example, on YouTube, they're all people who are authentic to themselves. I know exactly what they're like, or if someone listens to my podcast, I would imagine they know exactly what I'm like, because what you see is what you get. You can't fake it for too long. Even if you're on reality TV and a camera is on you, you know, you can't fake it for too long. Eventually you will relapse into being who you are. So I think that there's something in that and you know, you spoke about sort of authenticity being difficult. And earlier you had mentioned that whenever people in public find you drawing something that only appreciative, and I'm just thinking of what my instinctive reaction would be. And it would also be appreciative regardless of the drawer or the drawing. And the reason for that would be that most of the ugly competition around us is people constantly trying to project an image of themselves onto the world. That's all that social media is. It's just a constant battle of posturing. And when someone is sitting lost in a drawing, what they're doing is exactly the opposite. They're not projecting an image of themselves onto the world, but they're internalizing something that they see and they're working on it. And just that act itself, there's a certain beauty to it, which I kind of appreciate there. So there is this mindset that on the one hand, you are seeking the zen like state that just going out there and drawing what you see gives you. At the other end, there is a hustle, like in one of your posts is also the picture of you in a suit. Like I think the Marriott commissioned you to do some paintings and they invited you to this gig and you had a stall like thing where you're selling books and you're wearing a suit and all that. And again, that's not sneaky art. It's non-sneaky selling. Absolutely. And you looked at technology for that in the sense you're very active on Reddit. That's been a part of your gig. You've been thinking fairly deeply about building communities like through Discord. You've been examining mechanisms like, you know, the buy me a coffee thing. And you're completely right that the remarkable thing is that, you know, 20 years ago, as a creator, I would not be able to reach my audience directly, I would have to go through an intermediary, there would be gatekeepers who would have the tools of publishing. I think the blogging age made me kind of jump through that. But even in the blogging age, even in the aughties, you know, while my readers would place value on my work, because they're reading it, they're spending time, time is money, I would not be able to capture any of that value directly. And the only way to capture it was in a very clumsy way where intermediaries say, I write for the Times of India, they accumulate eyeballs, they sell advertising, a very small chunk of that comes to me. And the remarkable thing about these modern times is today, that's changed completely, you know, as I've experienced over the last year and a half as you've experienced. So tell me a little bit more about your feelings about what this new age holds for creators. Like how do you think differently now about your art than say, when you started?"

There have been services that have tried to do this before, there was this service called Flatter. And Flatter, the idea is beautiful. The idea is that if you are a Flatter user, say you're a reader who reads a lot, you have a Flatter account, and you would put in $30 a month. This is my patronage to various creators that I will find on the internet. Wherever you go, you find a YouTube video, you write, you see an article you like, if they have a Flatter button, you click it. And what it does is suppose you click 10 buttons over the month, it will split your $30 into 10 places and give it to these people."

        "message": "The trouble with that was it was before its time. For various reasons, it didn't work. One was that you need to have a Flatter account. So every person who wants to endorse has to sign up with this service. That's a hurdle, won't happen. Secondly, what happened was that the notion of microtransactions did not exist in the way it does. So that needed many things to happen together. That needs firstly, it needs people to get tired of institutional content. It needs people to be tired of what the algorithm is throwing at them. So suppose all of this technology was possible in 2012, it would not work because people were too enamored by Facebook. What Facebook is throwing at them is still so fresh that why do I need to record is this I'm getting all this for free. So many forces had to come align in a sense, like so many stars had to align for this to be the right time for this to happen, that we are very of the algorithm, we are tired of the kind of content that is thrown at us. And we are seeing so much new content and so many incredible formats and all these random creators creating something extremely unexpected from so much like all this, all these TikTok creators, the kind of thing like, so that people dismiss TikTok, right? Like just think what TikTok is doing to Instagram. Instagram meant that if I make a piece of art, which is which maybe took me five months to make, I make an Instagram post of it, because that's the only place you can post. And people are just scrolling past, maybe I get point one seconds from somebody. That's it, if they really like me, maybe they give me one second, if they are absolutely in love with me, maybe they will read my caption. So five seconds. That's it. That's it. TikTok. If you do a decent job, you are asking and you are getting 30 seconds of engagement, you're getting 60 seconds of engagement, because now you can make 60 second videos. That is orders of magnitude more. And all it needs is for you to engage in its format, that same piece of art. If you just set it to music. And after you made it, you just make a video sort of moving over it and showing all its nuances to the right mood set by the right song within a 60 second clip, suddenly you are getting millions of people to engage with you for 60 seconds, they are in it for this experience. Like this is a result of its times and it is causing so much fantastic usage like this idea that you can use a song and you can repurpose it to show art or you can repurpose it and to dance to it. These are all these are not envisioned by TikTok founders. These are all things that innovative creators came up with to circumvent as they were thinking the systems. But what they did was they charted a new path of things that are possible to do. Then came this idea that, oh, I'll also imitate what this person did. And then there was this idea. Oh, now there are trends. You do dances according to TikTok, you do acts according to TikTok. All of that became a thing because hashtags will proliferate. So all of these systems, how they work organically to make things happen. It's never because of one thing or one person or one idea. It's because of all these various things aligning. And as a creator today, all of these various things are aligning in beautiful ways. So like I was saying before, like I have little patience for people who say that I'm just an artist. I don't want to think about the money. Because what you are saying is I want to go back to 2005. I don't want that to be. I don't care about social media. I don't care about monetization streams. I just want to make art and I want some gallery owner to love me and then sell my art to people. You are asking us to go back in time to those days. And therefore, you want to resurrect the gates and the gatekeepers. Your personal inabilities aside, I have no patience for that. I'm sorry. So hopefully we, but the future that we are thinking about, the future that we are starting to see is not a singular idea future. So hopefully that market will still exist and gallery owners will exist and curators will exist and you will hopefully continue to make sales. But since you will not, that is not the only market anymore. It will not be the way you envisioned it would be. And I for one, I'm glad for that because it allows people like me to be an artist. It allows people like me to be a podcaster and it allows people like me to reach 1,000 true fans with a newsletter, things that would be impossible before. So this is just a glorious time to be a creator. Like I think it is the best time to, it's, it has, it has its risks because now that this idea is there, what it does is it takes away this, the beauty of anonymity and maybe this is me being nostalgic about what it used to be like. So maybe I'm wrong, but if you're a blogger before and you don't have an audience, there is a certain phase in your life when you need to not have an audience. You need to just like, so that cynical phase of me, when I was making jokes and getting things out, this got me in the flow of expressing myself. If I was getting reactions then and people telling me, how can you make this joke? How dare you? Or someone reading it and maybe not saying that, let's say nobody sends me those reactions, but I know 5,000 people are reading it. I might be affected. I might start thinking about, do I want to say this to people? Should I say to people, what if something happens, someone's self-conscious like me, if I had a notion of a vast audience, I would have trouble saying things like flip side of thinking that you can get an audience if you do the right thing, is that you don't enjoy the time that you don't have an audience. And I think a lot of creators and writers and artists should cherish the period when they don't have an audience. That's the time when you can put in like lots of work, not have a fixed image of yourself because once you have an audience, they have an image of you. And I just spoke, I recorded with somebody recently who did really well on Instagram. And she grew an audience to like 30, 40,000 followers. And what that did was it chained her, it bound her. Now she felt I have to give them what they want. I can't do just what I want. This drawing that I wanted to make, I can't share it because that's not what clicked last time. So I have to do what clicked last time and things escalated and it became really bad for her. She worked a lot. She got into depression and anxiety, suffered from a burnout. And she had to kind of take these reins back in her hands. And we talk about that in our conversation. This episode is going to come out next week. In fact, that how important it is to engage with the audience in a new medium. So this is another aspect of the creator economy today, which is beautiful in that you can take your audience from one platform to another and engage with them in a different way. This is absolutely not answering the question you asked, but I see the internet as two kinds of places as a creator. So one is a place where metaphorically you cast a net, you catch attention and you people look at you, Twitter's like that, Facebook's like that, Instagram is like that, but these are also split. They look at you and then they look away. So you have one second at best to do something, play your trick. And that trick is to take them to the other part of the internet. These I think of as destinations. This is your blog. This is your newsletter. This is your podcast. And a small fraction of these people whose attention you catch will go with you over there. They will hit that link and they will go somewhere. But this is then your opportunity to engage with them on new terms. So a lot of people are frustrated with how things are today that, oh, the internet is such a terrible place for content and this and that. But it's because you're doing things on Instagram that can't be done on Instagram. You can't talk to people on Instagram. That's not what they go to Instagram to do. They go there to scroll and you are saying, don't scroll. Zuckerberg is making them scroll, giving them dopamine for scrolling. And you are saying, don't scroll. You're making it an unpleasant experience. They feel guilt whenever they see your post and therefore they avoid your post even more. So you have to take them to that platform where they will engage with you. So you must have seen this, like, like you were talking about how you were doing shorter form content before, because you thought there's no market for this, right? And in fact, one of the first times we had engaged with each other on Twitter, you had posted something about a short attention span. And I had replied saying that I don't think there is a short attention span. And that later became a blog post I wrote in, I formulated further ideas from it. Like I told you in that tweet, there's no short attention span because more PhD thesis are written today than ever before. And read more big books and big series are written today and read by more people. And more long TV series are binge watched. So that short attention span is not true. It's an observation bias because short attention span people make themselves known and float to the top and occupy all make a lot of noise because they have a short attention span."

        "message": "I think this way of thinking is an example of a model that is useful, but not necessarily the whole truth. Because the way I look at the content I discover and the things I listen to, and typically a lot of it will come when a friend will recommend something highly and say, Hey, check this out. And, you know, regardless of my attention span or consideration span, I'll trust that judgment and go with it. And if it is someone whose work I'm familiar with, which is actually most of the content we consume, or at least I consume, I'm not sure this would be necessarily an issue. So, you know, so here's the thing. I was like number one to respond to what you said earlier, I kind of agree with you like one of my guests on the show in an episode I've already recorded, but will release next week, December 6. But before this episode releases is also a former writer of Gussaki Maaf, which is Abhinandan Sekri, who runs News Laundry. And he and I were chatting about how if when we were 20, if we posted what we thought on Twitter, we would have been cancelled for sure. We would, you know, screenshots of that time would surface today, and we'd be screwed. Because you need this period of time, like you said, when you're anonymous, when no one's reading you, when you can discover what you're doing, either in terms of your thinking or your view of the world, or of your art and all of that. And that's incredibly useful. But at the same time, like my blog, fortunately enough, right from the start had a pretty big audience, so we're seen in the unseen us today, though it's now lost in the mists of time. But that was very useful for me, actually, because that kept me going. The fact that like people would write to me, you know, at my peak, after I'd done five years of it, like between 2004 and 2009, I did some five posts a day on my blog. So I had 8000 posts in that period. And at my peak, I had some 20,000 views a day, which was a lot of which was responsibility, which was that, you know, people would write to me and say that, hey, I live in New Zealand, and I don't read any of the Indian newspapers, I just go to India Uncut, and I see what's happening there. And this, of course, was, you know, back in the day before social media really took off before Twitter and all that. So this was a great commitment device that I would write because I felt they were listeners. The other aspect of this whole thing of artists needing to be salesmen, is that, yeah, I get it that these opportunities are open to you. And you can't just say, right, I'll do my art, you want it to reach someone, you want it to have an effect, you want to do justice to the art that you produce and get it to its audience. But you know, one issue that can emerge with that is that people then start depending too much on validation, that they'll do something, and they'll market it, and they'll say, shit, I'm getting 10 views, I'm getting 13 views, or like Puneet Superstar in the earlier discussed story, three views per video. And then you say that I'm not going to do this anymore. And that's disastrous, because the advice I give young creators is that find something that you love doing for its own sake, and then just stick to it and don't look for validation for a long, long time. Because creators tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term. And if you're constantly making your production depend on validation, and validation will not come early on, one, because it takes time to organically build an audience and two, because you will suck at the start, like I'm sure even your old drawings suck. So you'll suck at the start, you got to keep doing it again and again, to become good. So I think it can become a bit of a double edged sword. But the important thing I would advise all creators, and in a sense, you've lived this with through your work, is that bloody hell, just do something you love. That's the starting point, you know, and then shit happens around it, you know, you build something organically. And yes, you can have a marketing mindset, a sales mindset, figure out how do I grow my brand? How do I build a community around me? How do I monetize it? But to me, all of those come later. The first thing is that do something you love. And if you love it, keep doing it."

        "message": "That's the whole point of loving something, absolutely, absolutely. And in fact, this is becoming easier today than before. Because while we were still in this earlier mindset that you need to appeal to these institutions that will sponsor you, you needed to therefore become viral, like that was the only means of success and virality meant appealing to millions of people, which means a broad denominator of people. And therefore, your work loses its unique charm. So maybe you sacrifice on the thing that you enjoy the most in the interest of fitting into a groove, which will go viral into formats that will go viral into styles that are trending. So therefore, I should do this. And therefore, it becomes less about your personal joy and more about these goals, which you need to reach in order to be able to do it. And then you sort of suspend your joy in the short term thinking, maybe once I reach this audience, then I'll be able to do these things. And then that never comes, because the never ending cycle, both of these points are true, like exactly, it's a double edged sword. So I was thinking about you getting 20,000 views in 2006 2007, the circumstance around that is so useful that there was no economy based on performative reactions. There was no Twitter. And therefore, I mean, yeah, so now because there is Twitter, there is a whole reputational economy based on reacting of virtue signaling and performative reactions to earnest content may be foolish, maybe wrong, maybe out of context, it is anathema even, but whatever something someone says, you are incentivized to take it out of context, you are rewarded for taking it to the worst possible attributions to those words. And whether or not you are right about it, there is a lot to gain from doing these things. And this just, it's not that these people are bad people, it's just that this algorithm is so rewarding if you do this, and it therefore it becomes the way that they interact with other people. Like I often think about why this happens. There are so many people who and you've spoken so much about and we've talked actually together about this kind of performative virtue signaling that happens on Twitter and why it happens. It's because I feel like we are so we've been thrust into the social media. And nobody is quite prepared for what it means that 1000 people will read what you are thinking. And those 1000 people are not in your locality, they are not 1000 people like you, who have had your education or your various socioeconomic parameters, a matchup, none of those things. They are from entirely different worlds. What social media is doing is, it is throwing these worlds together, these worlds are colliding to use George Costanza's phrase. And that's makes George angry. That's a terrible, unfortunate situation. Someone is young on Twitter, and they see somebody tweet something that hurts them. Maybe Amit says something about someone that they idolize, and they don't like it. Because that's not Amit talking to his people. This that is this entity who has entered their world, saying something about something that they feel a certain way about. And they don't have the wherewithal, the understanding or maybe the time and mental energy to put it in its own context. Because this whole game is about reacting in your context, you are reacting to your followers, right? This is how Twitter works. You are not saying something to the person. This is why I like Reddit so much as compared to Twitter. For example, you're not saying something to the person on Twitter, you are saying something for your people to hear you say to that person. So performativeness is not like this terrible thing they did. Performativeness is what they have been forced into. I respond to someone on Twitter, I typed out half my reply, and I think, you know, my followers are going to see this. Do I want people to see this? Do I care to say this if other people are going to see this and then they'll follow this thread and what will that say about me? So this, I am being forced into a performance. I didn't ask for it. I don't want it. I don't want to see what other people reply to other people's tweets. Like I literally just want to see people's tweets. I don't want to see what they like. I don't want to see who they follow. I don't want to see who they reply to. Because sometimes you find out unpleasant things about people you're speaking to also and you don't want to shatter that image like you. I just want to know you as this thing. I don't care to know more about you. Please let's keep distance. But Twitter doesn't let you. It throws this performativeness and this really terrible situations at you. And people are reacting to it. Reacting is this privilege, you know, like we live in a hierarchical country. Like we were talking right at the start of this conversation about how the cynicism meant putting someone down, right, because in a hierarchical mindset, that's the way you have value. There is no objective value. There is only am I better than this or am I worse than that? So always we are trying to climb over someone else, because that's the only way we can get a sense. Like if I have climbed over this person, I am better than so many people. If I can dunk on Amit Verma on Twitter, then I can in front of my crowd look smarter than Amit Verma on Twitter. That does not take into account what Amit feels about it. That does not take into account whether I misread or correctly interpreted what Amit said. It does not care about these things, because in his world, in their world, this person is trying to climb a little bit higher. And these things are sadly incentivized. And these things, when someone gets the first chance to react to someone, again, in a hierarchical country, you don't get many opportunities to express yourself. Suddenly you can. You can respond not only to Amit Verma. You can even respond to Amitabh Bachchan. And you can make fun of, oh, you put tweet numbers, ha ha ha, old man. And whatever. You can. Everybody's in that stage that I was in, that cynical stage, like nobody else matters. I am the only real person. These are all figments of my imagination. All these are the humans."

If some worldviews are like religion, you know, if you attack somebody's God, of course they will get offended. So just as a question of politeness, I would not say bad things about somebody's religion. But in a similar way, if you say something about that disagrees with someone's ideological point of view or challenges that, you're basically doing exactly the same thing. So it becomes personal. But what is worse, and I think Jonathan Haidt pointed to it that, you know, the seminal moment in all of this and social media becoming toxic was the Facebook like button and the Twitter retweet button. Because suddenly that validation becomes a big deal. And if there is one trend I absolutely hate about Twitter, it's about dunking on people. You know, we should be discussing ideas, we should be discussing things, policies, events. Instead we are dunking on individuals all the time. Like I see so many people dunking on Chetan Bhagat, for example. Bhai, if you don't like him, don't read him. There's no need to, you know, why are you giving him space in your head? You know, and frankly, my sense of Chetan Bhagat, and I think I shared this in clear writing group that we're both part of today, is that, you know, beyond the point, the bottom line is he's right about the elites. You know, he's gone out there, and he's done what he's done. And he's a doer, he's writing books, he's changing the culture, no matter what we think of the books he's writing or the way he's changing the culture, while we elites are sipping up in our guladas. He's also an elite. He's also an elite, that's a different matter. My point is that stop dunking on the guy. If you think he's worth nothing, why waste your mind space on him?"

And how do you do this? You do this by abusing the people in the other group and abusing people within your own group for not being pure enough, like you're kind of lucky you're not bigger than you are. Otherwise, there would be one set of vokes attacking you for not showing women in your drawings because they saw a couple where there weren't any women. And another set accusing you of being a voyeur because you just had women in your drawings. You know, you can interpret anything anyway in bad faith. And that's the problem. You know, I would like to think that all arguments should be in good faith, you assume goodwill. But if you assume that the other person is malicious, and if you have determined that you're going to attack them to show your own virtue, I think it's a problem.

So I have I have reached this understanding that Twitter is not useful this way. But that's because the rest of my world aligns in a certain way. And I think this, and I have this beautiful art that makes me appreciate other people. So therefore, I don't think of it in this way. But so I want to what I want to talk about, therefore, is that in this pursuit, I have discovered good ways of engaging. And that's why I like Reddit so much more than Twitter. And Reddit does these precise things differently from Twitter. You can't be performative to your audience because you don't carry your audience with you into Reddit. You talk inside subreddits, and therefore you talk within a context to a community. You don't talk to your people. You have to address other people. So you have to acknowledge their reality and their existence in your in in the real world. And you have to obey the laws of that engagement in that subreddit. And there are very strict rules enforced by voluntary moderators, which keeps things civil, which keeps things relatively normal. And what this does is the same kind of person who behaves a certain way on Twitter cannot behave that way on Reddit and get away with it. And people who are on Reddit have to engage in at least well, there are parts of Reddit where this is not true. But vast parts of Reddit, they have to engage in good faith arguments, they have to respect the sanctity of a subreddit topic, they can't just bullshit around it. It's disincentive not because it's good or bad, because it's disincentivized, because you will be downvoted into oblivion. The like button on Reddit does good things. The like button on Facebook does terrible things. The retweet button on Twitter does terrible things because you use it to perform it perform in front of your audience, not even retweet, maybe the quote tweet button, the idea that you just add a comment and then you put their thing and then it's like, Oh, this is about this and I'm dunking on them. So that does ugly things. Reddit has a cross posting function, which is just about taking from one subreddit to another subreddit. And that does not do that terrible thing. It is a it is a positive function. It helps, again, bring attention back to the work of that person and how it fits the notion of this other subreddit. So for example, some I drew a drawing and I posted it in our Vancouver, and somebody cross posted it to our slash mildly interesting. This is a mildly interesting thing I saw you might like it. This was good. It added value to my work. So I learned Oh, my work is mildly interesting. Since then I posted on mildly interesting myself, I went right to the top, I am proud to say that I am this year's among this year's top 10 most mildly interesting things on the internet."

But if you don't, if you're not in the business of sharing opinions, then maybe you have not arrived at that understanding. The trouble with Reddit is not that these people behave in this way. The trouble with Reddit is that we are exposed to everything anybody does. And this exposure, this idea that all these worlds are colliding with us is just fundamentally all wrong.

Non fungible token is anything that cannot be exchanged for something just like it. It has its own unique value. So non fungible tokens have been mostly used in the term of art right now, but they have all kinds of uses. So a non fungible token can be simply your right to say an artist sells a non fungible token for something, something value. And now that token gives you the right, it works as a backstage pass to all their concerts. As long as you own that token, that NFT and hundreds of people might, you can go to all their concerts and you have a special seat and you can always get a backstage entry. So that thing does not have the same value always. Its value will keep changing. If the artist gets better, its value will increase. It will be traded by other people like maybe I don't care about this artist anymore. Why don't you buy it from me? I'll sell it to you for $10 million because now he's the biggest artist in the world. So this value is always fluctuating. So that's what makes it non fungible. Like it's not easily exchangeable for just something, there's no static value to it. Now what it rests upon is your notion of the value of digital content in the digital realm. Does digital art or a digital product have value in your life? It takes a lot of meaning from games, for example, in lots of games. If you are really vested in your character, what is what is called MMORPGs, massively multiplayer online role playing games. You have various characters that you build over time, they gain experience, they gain in these various medieval sort of setting universes. They get all these items of clothing or weapons, and you can set them up and you create and you give them some kind of value. And sometimes you have things that you can pay for. You can get this clothing, which is like this, this, this, but you pay $5 for it or you pay $10 for it or more like who knows whatever, but do you want to do it? It's not really you're not holding it, you're not actually possessing it. It's just in this realm, in this game, in this context, in this character, it's virtual. But it can have real value, right? Like it depends on how much time you spend on that game, how vested you are, how many what social networks you have within it, it can have real value to you. So if you could buy the blue tick on Twitter, for example, so that has real value, but it's a digital thing. It's not a real good. So if you believe in the idea that virtual worlds can have items that have real monetary value, then we are thinking about the ways that we interact with virtual worlds in the future and web 3.0 and metaverse and all these ideas are about more and more virtual worlds existing in our reality, whether it's virtual reality, whether it's augmented reality, and what is the value of getting something over there and flexing it or using it in some way. So this is where this is what NFTs offer you in art. At the moment, NFTs are or art or writing or audio, NFTs are a way of associating with an artist or a writer or a creator that you like because you own something that they have. So it's almost like buying a share. If someone could buy a share in Amit Verma, that share will always change in value, but they buy it with the idea that now they believe in you. Now they believe in what you are going to do in the future, and they expect it to appreciate in value. They might never sell it, but they expect it to not be a money thrown down the drain. Meanwhile, that money is money that you can use to become a better artist."

And we need to disable right click. Some people are even doing that. That's not something I believe in. I think that's nonsense. That's never going to happen. You need to have value outside of this fact. Because the internet is not about not letting other people have content. Right click save is the essence of a lot of art I have absorbed and learned, you're not going to disable right click save, you're not going to disable screenshots and things like that, that has to always remain. It's the essence of knowledge and the promise of the internet that you are going to have this. So it has to have some other value in my mind, this kind of value is nonsense, this the demand for it is also nonsense. But there are there is other value being created around even an NFT of a blog post you wrote, for example, right. So you have 10,000 blog posts, every week, you write a newsletter post, and every week, somebody can buy an NFT of it. That thing can does not mean that nobody else gets to read that newsletter, or save that newsletter or print that newsletter. But within a context, there is a place there is a ledger, where you are acknowledged as the owner of that post. I suppose I buy that newsletters NFT that posts NFT. So I am acknowledged as the owner, there is a list somewhere in which I am there and those other right click people are not there, or those savers printers are not there. That list can have value if you use it that way. So if Amit decides that everybody who owns an Amit NFTs, we are going to all have brunch together, I get invited, right, the people who saved it don't get invited, you are incentivizing people to buy that NFT, and you are creating value around that NFT."

And we were discussing this, that any revolutionary new activity comes with the people who just want to grab a lot of cash out of it. So maritime trade, for example, started with piracy. But that doesn't mean maritime trade is evil and we should not invest in it or we should not care about it or we should not do maritime trade or if you are a trader of goods. It is essential, but it started with piracy. So you can't allow those early adopters to define things. That is my answer to this apprehension also, that they don't get to define it. Maybe it can be redefined. Maybe they do end up like a part of me. The moralist part of me is that why should I enable them to make money? Because the more, if I use Ethereum, Ethereum gains value also as my contribution to it. Any trading in this currency gives value to the currency and these people who are sitting on it will use it for nefarious things, which is being done like a lot of cryptocurrency is used for terrible crimes and criminal activities because it's undocumented. But then, but then all money is, all money is, all money is, but it has never been this easy for someone to hold 4000 and for it to become 50,000 the next day. And today it is like Elon Musk needs to tweet once and that 50,000 becomes 1 million tomorrow. And then it can be used. And then day after tomorrow, that 1 million can be brought down to 30,000 again. So this kind of quick manipulation and globally impacting instantaneous quick manipulation is unprecedented. It just makes me feel a little iffy about the way things like for a decentralized currency to be so dependent, so affected by the tweet of a crazy person is just ridiculous to me that he can affect it 30, 40% in value. What kind of insider trading must he be doing? And what does that do? So suppose I own, I have large Ethereum holdings and I have large Bitcoin holdings and Dogecoin holdings and Elon Musk is big on all of these things. In a sense, I'm beholden to Elon Musk, his reputation. If Elon Musk goes to jail, all of these things plummet. Do I not want Elon Musk to go to jail for crimes then after if suppose he commits a horrible crime in the future, anybody, any billionaire commits a terrible crime in the future, their holdings of a certain cryptocurrency can have impact on my life savings. So am I now their vassal in a sense that I don't want my overlord to be touched? It makes me think that there is this techno feudalism that we are entering into with this cryptocurrencies that we were beholden say until now with national currencies, you have beholden to a nation state, right? If that nation collapses, then that currency also collapses. But now cryptocurrencies are going to be managed by companies and venture capitalists. And they say decentralized, but I don't quite buy it. Because well, at least in this initial stage, my apprehension is that that's a cover. And the billionaires and the rogue capitalists and whatever these you know, like, I do doesn't make me doesn't make me their vassal. Am I now beholden to them and that thought is very deeply unsettling to me. One part of me doesn't want to invest in it. The other part of me is like, I don't want anything to do with you. I'm not going to help you. I don't need to make money off of you. I'll do my own thing. Like you said, with Patreon and other avenues, I'll buy Why can't I do it that way? Why do I need to do NFTs? So a large part of my excitement with NFTs is that not necessarily that I have to do NFTs, but that they are opening up people's minds to other forms of engagement and other forms of value creation. So the idea that value can be created by forming a community around a certain artist or an artwork, and that then it is expected that these communities will have these kind of exclusive events that sends a base value once people internalize that this sort of thing is supposed to be worth $100 a month, why not? Then they are open to paying you that money. Like as soon as people understood that, oh, $5 a month is something that is done to support an artist. Now I'm able to charge that money $5 a month and many, many people are paying me that and helping me thrive. So I have so many ideas around the ways I want to create value around my art. They are not bound to NFTs. In my case, but NFTs being the hot thing that they are mean that many, many more people are likely to jump into it if I if it is offered as an NFT, then if the same thing is offered in another platform. So then again, that tantalizes me that why don't I enter it because FOMO this this thing is important to me like I love playing games. All of my life life is just a bunch of different games and how we play these games and what games we play and what are the rules we formulate and what are the reward mechanisms. This is fun. This is what this is what the great kick of being an entrepreneur is you get to play games and you get to play what I call infinite games. So finite games are the ones that have an end. And so I used to play a lot of sports like I used to play badminton when I was in school. I played badminton for my college also. And I have also been a computer gamer. And I noticed this thing in all of these things that I'm very competitive, and I love being good at things. So I was very good at badminton and squash and things. But I don't care if I lose or win."

So maybe it's almost not so good if I win like losing is a more useful trait than winning. Because it keeps you focused and enjoying and learning, learning and doing appreciating and you know, getting into it with more vigor next time. And so these infinite games are interesting to me. And as an artist, I play infinite games. I'm in the business of playing infinite games.

But now I'm doing some more impromptu self conversations with myself. I am reading out stories that I'm creating around my art. I am doing what I call post script conversations. So once these list of questions and ideas run out, the guest and I just sort of lean back and we're like, Oh, okay, how was that? How did that go? You know, there's this very long goodbye, like, okay, let's talk later. But there's one more thing and then you end up talking for a half hour, 45 minutes more. So I call this a post script. And I record this also now and if it's nice, I share this with so my insiders are my focus group with whom I played what I call these games is that I share my vulnerable media. I'm not so sure how it is. Please tell me. I am not so confident in doing these things. Please tell me what you think like me talking just into a mic and telling you a story is not something I'm kicked about sharing with my general podcast audience yet. But with you, I will because you are my true fans. You really care about my work and what I'm another thing I'm doing right now, which has been really fun and very gratifying and coming to the point of what you said about blogging with an audience. So this is a small audience, my insiders, not my broad audience, but I am writing my book with them. I share passages of my next book, which is going to be sneaky out of Vancouver, and I'm going to self publish it, but I'm writing it and I every month I share a new passage with them. And what this does is it puts me on a monthly schedule every month, I have to have a substantial amount written, it has to be about my art, it has to be about Vancouver. So I'm incentivized this month to explore Vancouver in some new way, which could add to that book. And I'm sharing it with this audience that is paying me to read it. They are my insiders, they care about my work. So they give me excellent feedback. They tell me what they like, they tell me what they didn't like, they I'm open to all kinds of criticism from them, because I know that they're coming from a they're vested in me. Right? Same similarly about like, you could imagine, oh, if you have people who own your NFTs, you know that these people really they are completely vested in you because financially they were like NFTs will rise in financial value, the better you do. So they are deeply incentivized to ensure your success. You are almost recruiting a team to do PR for you also, because they are deeply incentivized to always talk about your work, because they own a part of your work, and that will go up in value, just like a patron of old, like if they have a painting of yours, it helps them if you sell paintings to other people also, because then their painting also goes up in value, or you sell painting somewhere else. So similarly, with my insiders, I'm playing these little games, which I'm enjoying a lot. And they give me feedback, it's useful feedback. And it makes me a better writer for my general podcast for my general newsletter, it makes me a better thinker, it forces me it incentivizes me to put my thoughts in order."

I mean, there's a clear writing community, obviously, you know, more than 1500 people have done the course more than 800 people within that community.

        "message": "No internet is true in the story. So there are consequences to unlicensed time travel. That was the idea of the book. That book has gone through five drafts since I left my PhD program, not full drafts even 60% 50% 40% 40% 30% entire rewrites though, right from the start again, every time the story has changed, it started as a first person narrative, it changed to an outside narrative, the characters have changed, the premise has changed, the ending has changed. My idea for it, the scope of it has changed. And I just find that it's very difficult, this process of writing a novel is very unrewarding because how it works is that you write the whole thing. And then you go to somebody and they tell you if they like it enough in that zeitgeist of that moment, whether it's worth publishing for them. And you have to take a rejection from a bunch of people after finishing the whole damn thing, which is so difficult. And then maybe two years later, it gets out. And then maybe you do all the work around it and people are ready for it at that time and it sells. So much work goes into this thing. And it is dependent on so much luck and circumstance like it is bound to so many failures that have nothing to do with your ability or your the value of your work that I just hate this system. So my current plan is and I don't get this with my other creative output, right? So my podcast I hear every week from people, people tell me on buy me a coffee, they buy me coffee, they tell me how they like it, my guests are there, I get to learn, have a discord around my art and my podcast. So I get to hear every week from people how that's going, we talk on that and we interact. My newsletter has an audience of true fans also, and then they get it every week and thousands of readers who tell me what they think what they like. So I get this feedback, I don't run on this feedback. And like to your point before, we need to be self motivated. I'm very, very insistent on that, that the fuel has to be me. It cannot be relied upon on other people. But this helps, it helps you to think that you're not screaming into the void, which is what Facebook in 2014 felt like just screaming into the void, and nothing is coming back. So my plan for now is that I want to continue to do this, just like the way I decided that I'm going to accept the title of artist, because that meant that I'm not a writer first. And I did that because what is my USP in this new country, that I was living in Wisconsin, my USP is that I'm making this art that nobody has seen this kind of art. Art is easy to appreciate, it needs 10 seconds of time, at most, and people are hooked, writing needs way more time before somebody is hooked, hooked, and you need to do a it's a far more difficult job. So it gets me a broader audience, and once you have an audience, you can do many things with that audience. I do not like the traditional novel publishing route. I don't like the system where I have to beg and plead for attention. And after I have done my job, I have to now finish the job. Now I have to desperately seek rewards for it, and validation for it before those rewards. How I want to do it is that I want to use my platform as a sneaky artist, while continuously writing fiction, nonfiction, everything, and develop my name, develop my brand, be somebody who is in a more commanding position with their work to get that attention. I don't want to have to beg for attention for my finished novel. I want there to be a group of people who will care for it already, who are waiting to read it, who will be willing to be beta readers of it. That's the conditions under which I want to put in that much single sided effort. Because I know that the novel is not something that I want to share chapter by chapter and get feedback. I want to finish the whole thing. Doing that means disengaging from a lot of other work. I can't just also be doing it on the side. I will have to take time to do only that. And that means killing a lot of other momentum. And I am not in a position that I want to kill that momentum just yet. I want to keep this dream alive that my fiction novel will get published and I will be a writer. Maybe it turns out to be unnecessary by the end. And I don't end up doing it. But this process right now of the reward mechanism and the way the art works, I make a drawing, I post it and I get dopamine. I like it. My natural inclination is towards it. I used to draw a lot of comics and I drew some long form comics also. And it was a very excruciating process for me. And I love it. And I want to do more of those things. I have come to understand that that is not who I am naturally. I am the kind of person who wants to do things once and get something for it. For good and for bad. And art, the way I draw, lends itself to that more easily. It has a lot of value to a lot of people. And by being a writer around it, I can create more and more value around it. Like I was saying, my hope is that this lets me be a writer later with a little more ease. And my hope is that once I taste this success, that I will be a little more amenable to rewriting, redrafting, and the long form work of putting together a novel."

And you know, when I look back at episodes that I read a year ago, I can't bear to hear them today. At the time, I might have liked them, and I refer them to someone and say, hey, I like doing this. But I'm not going to go back and actually listen to it. It's in my past. Like, honestly, Nishant, by the time this episode is out, it's out of my system, right? You know, I'm on to new episodes. That's the whole game for me. And the other part of it is that what we've seen in all media is that intermediaries are falling apart. We don't need them anymore. Right? Our creators are reaching their audiences directly monetizing that directly. Now at one level, the notion of the book as 100,000 word 150,000 word thing that you publish in that particular packaging is I think the artifact of an earlier era. That's number one, that writing doesn't have to be, you know, writing can be shorter or longer or structured differently or sold differently, packaged differently. But also publishing houses, I think are largely dinosaurs, they're like the gatekeepers of old, they're just like the art galleries that we kind of discussed, you know, often following fashions of the times and being restricted by the tastes of the people who kind of happened to be there, which, you know, might close out many groups of people, especially less privileged groups of people, for example, who just might not have that entry point to begin with and less privileged in different ways. So you've experimented with self publishing as well. So what was that experience like? Because when I was growing up in India, no doubt when you were growing up in India as well, which is possibly a decade after me, self publishing was considered, you know, people look down on it, like you couldn't find a publisher to TK, Calcutta had a famous self publisher writers workshop run by P Lal. So the whole gig was that, oh, you couldn't find a publisher to self publish, you know,"

        "message": "so yeah, so there is this, again, there was this hierarchy, right? Because while there were institutions, the point of institutions is that they have perceived value. There is this esteem and this prestige that comes with being associated with say, Penguin or Harper Collins or whatever names there are. But that is falling apart in this new world. Increasingly, people, in fact, cherish the independent creator. They understand this idea of the privilege associated with having a publisher has reached a lot more people. This idea that it's not all merit, it's a lot of circumstance and it's a lot of privilege. It's about networks and contacts. Very often doesn't mean that published people are not good, but very often this is a factor of these other things also. And therefore, someone being independent is not inferior to a published person. This is the crux of what has been absorbed. And in fact, perhaps we need to value these underdogs who are putting out content. Thanks to YouTube. Thanks to Twitch. Thanks to Twitter. Thanks to TikTok. Also, these independent people have created a market for independent content. This is something that I really enjoyed. I really admired because I have always felt like an outsider. I didn't study English in like my bachelor's. So I did not spend time around people who were writing all the time. I didn't spend time around people who could tell me about the craft of writing. I'd therefore later, these people would end up joining publishing houses as editors or as readers or as publishers or whatever various capacities of that hierarchy. I don't know these people. So therefore I have none of those contacts. I'm not an artist also trained. So I have no contacts in any geographical region with curators or gallery owners, etc. So I'm an outsider in all of these worlds. And the only way things have worked for me is with the latest technology of the time. The social media worked for me at the time. And now the creator economy, media, and the services associated around that are working for me. So after I sold art, the first season of selling art in Wisconsin in 2018, I thought at the end of that season, what I'm going to do next year, because I was thinking that suppose someone has put my art on the wall, how much more are they going to buy? Even if they really like me, how much like how much wall space will someone give me man, limited hair, why shouldn't they patronize other artists and like, I'll run out of repeat customers. So now I need to occupy a different part of their home. Literally, this was the thought, a book can occupy a different part of their home. Book is a nice gift book is a nice thing to keep. Why don't I make a coffee table book. And I just thought I'll make it because there was no way that I could I couldn't even imagine getting someone interested in it. But this is what I did to really understand the process. I went to this writer's workshop in Chicago. And this was not a workshop to teach you to write. But this was a workshop about pitching to literary agents. And America has a very thriving independent publishing industry as well as the traditional and many different scales of it. So there are small publishers that are larger medium and larger publishers also. So all of these processes are therefore very formalized, and it's very good to be a new person getting into them. So I got a 20 minute session, or maybe it was a 10 minute session with a literary agent. And she just loved what I told her she loved my pitch. She loved my idea. And I took some samples of how my book might look like I printed out 10 pages and I showed this is what I want my art book to look like and she just loved it. So she was an instant fan. Like she said it in so many words that you've absolutely got me like I'm in but I don't think this should be traditionally published. That's what she said. And this was around the incentives of traditional publishing. And I think every writer like we are talking about whether you want to write a book or not every writer should also think about what is the reward of traditional publishing to them and then to the publisher. So a publisher will publish if they can see a financial reward which comes from 1000s of copies. It doesn't come from 100s of copies. It depends on like the large costs associated with their work, then they have to time it so that they can promote it. So it has to fit into their calendar, which has involves other authors and other things and things that they might perceive are competing with your book. So do they want to promote two things that might eat into each other. So now suddenly you are locked into a competition with someone that you don't intend you don't even know, but simply out of virtue of being associated with a publisher you are. So my circumstance in Wisconsin was that I want to make a book about this town in Wisconsin. The population is only 80,000. My largest market is 100,000 potential and 100,000 market doesn't mean 100,000 people will buy the book. 10% of this market will buy the book if I am lucky. So most likely I have 100s of copies to sell. Who cares which publisher will care about that? No publisher will care. But this doesn't mean that there are no rewards in it for me. The act of putting together a book is a fantastic learning exercise. That's a reward for me. The cost of self publishing and then the profit of selling all of those books. There is a financial reward for me. There is a reputational reward in having a book. It's something that I bring along to various people. Like when I give podcast conversations, I carry the book and I give it to podcast hosts before and then they look at it and they feel nice and then I feel nice and then they keep it and it occupies a space on their shelf. That is a reward for me. That is a non-monetary, but it is a very significant reward if I occupy that space in someone's"

        "message": "Carry on. So she asked me to formulate a nonfiction book proposal and a nonfiction book proposal has these various criteria that you fulfill. Firstly you have to, so a fiction book proposal needs a full book, full book manuscript. But a nonfiction book proposal does not need that. It needs two chapters and an introduction and a table of contents. So my book doesn't have chapters because it's all art. So I just thought, okay, 20 pages and a table of contents or whatever, whatever the format is as I imagine. And I'll write the intro. So that I needed to do. And I needed to think of it as what the final product is going to be. Then another aspect of this is of preparing a book, a nonfiction book proposal is that you have to talk about your audience, who is your target audience? Not only that, oh, everybody who loves art, no, geographically, age wise, socially, various interests, numbers, use numbers. My audience is the kind of people who buy this kind of book, which sold 5 million copies. My audience is people ages 30 to blah, blah, blah, living in this part of the world. The population census number is this. So this is a, again, a dispassionate way to look at your work. It asks you to do this. Secondly, pitching like this means that suddenly you start to see who does it have value for? Why is this not my audience? Why is this my audience? What can it be? What can I do so that this is also my audience? Suddenly you're thinking not of changing your art, not of changing your craft, but of how you talk about it. How do I get these other people to be interested? So Eau Claire has a university. So there are parents of students. Why shouldn't the parents who live maybe in other states or other towns, why shouldn't they also, they should also care about this book. How can I make my book so that even they are part of my target demographic? Another part I had to write was your competence. Why are you the right person to write this book? Traditionally nonfiction would be say politics, economics. So you would have to cite your degrees or your experience to say that I have, I'm an authority on the subject. In this case, it was an art book. So I only had to say, I'm an artist. This book is from the perspective of somebody who has spent two years in this town and is not from this town. So I am the only person who can write this book effectively, because now I have changed what this book is also about to suit why I am the only person to write this book. Again, this slightly shifted. What does this book mean? How am I going to later talk about this book to people? How am I going to present this book to people in the introduction? That also shifted slightly because I had to figure out why I am the most appropriate person to write a book of art about Eau Claire. No, this is because it is a book of sneaky art about Eau Claire from somebody who is not of this town and is trying to understand this town. Therefore, the only person who can write it is somebody who is not from this town and who makes art like me, sneaky. So I sort of created these circumstances around it. And then there are a couple of other things you're supposed to write in a non-fiction. It's a roughly a 20 page proposal, but I filled out the whole thing. Didn't send it to anybody because by the time I wrote it, I concluded that self-publishing is what I need to do because there's nobody who's going to care. Like what did I say? 500 people will buy this book. I can't even see. I don't know. There are three bookstores here. What thousand people will these numbers don't matter to them. So they will not be interested, but that this book needs to exist because I want to occupy a new part of people's home and I want to create something and I want to see what it is like to do it. And all of these processes are amazing learning experiences around making a book. So I went to a independent press in the neighboring city in Minneapolis and I, they do independent book books. So what they do is that they have a formalized process of how to put this together. There are a bunch of six, seven meetings on different topics, but they get you in touch with a designer who might be skilled at the genre you are aiming at. And then there are associated fees for these various meetings, for this various things that they will do for you, like getting you an ISBN listing, et cetera, et cetera. The designers fees, the feedback and all the various interchange and meetings you'll have. So finally printing, deciding on what quality of pages you want, deciding on what size you want the book. Should it have a hard cover? Should it have a jacket? I made all of these calls myself. I want my book to be a square book. I don't want it to be long or tall. I wanted to have a hard cover with a dust jacket and I wanted to lay flat so that if I have these spreads, two page spread drawings, I want them, someone to be able to put it flat on their coffee table and see it without having to hold it. And I want to have that. So I was thinking about user experience around the book. How will they regard a book of art? How will they keep it in their house? If it can lay flat, it can be left flat. Maybe they leave it as an open page. That might be interesting. It's an art display. They can flip the page every day. So this thing stuck in my head. When I would later sell the book, I would tell people this, that look, this book lays flat. Every day you can turn the page and then 100 days you will have 100 pieces of art to look at because it's 112 odd pages. This again became a way for me to sell this book. Again it became a way for me to create value around this book. It became a way for me to see value around my art and my book and my work."

And most importantly, can this model scale, like I understand for one person doing an art book in a particular location, you can make it work for you. But what are your thoughts on self publishing in general, like how far along has print on demand come? I keep telling young writers who want to write articles for Indian Express or Times of India and all of that, that don't do that because for a number of reasons. One is that you will not be writing enough because the gatekeepers won't approve you enough and you need to write a lot to be good. Two, your pieces will all be dispersed. So if you want to build a community of your fans, you can't do that. Someone will read your piece in TOI and will say, oh, what a good writer and but then, you know, whereas if you just write in a newsletter, if they like what you do, they can subscribe to you, you build a community of your fans, your work isn't dispersed, it's in one place. But that's what those kind of writers, whereas, you know, are there possibilities where is print on demand advanced enough that people can, can someone write a bestseller today, an actual bestseller, bestseller, without going through a publisher, just using Amazon's"

        "message": "print on demand, for example. So for example, how I did this was that I printed 500 copies, we reached a number for that it was roughly $10,000 at that time for me. So roughly $20 per book, I decided to sell it at $30 because I wanted to put at the lowest price point that this town is not rich, that they'll buy it, but I'll make some profit. I broke even very quickly, not only the book, but when I started selling the book, the associated prints and things like that, within two months, I broke even with my 10,000, I made a lot of money very quickly, I did the job of distributing it myself also. So the marketing job, once you have the book, however, you there are lots of advisories on this, by the way, you can then so many resources, beautiful resources, reach out to local bookstores, local gift shops, tell them you're going to do a book launch, they will give you the space and the blah, blah, blah, and they will take a cut of the book. And you can call your fans there. I had people drive two and a half hours to come to buy the book from me. It was just it was unreal when that's when this person said to me that I drove 200 miles just for this just to buy the book from someone you didn't know before I had no idea. They came from 200 miles away. Because what I was offering was and again, I offered people that anybody who buys a book from me in person, I will draw a portrait of you right there and then in the first page of the book. This is my thank you to you for buying from me. The Marwari artist. Yeah, it's it's art. Art should not be like, oh, I only draw when I'm I don't believe all that stuff. And look at the self improvement aspect."

So this is how I formed a bond with them. I had real conversations with them. Tell me about your life. What brought you down here? How are you doing today? Like what? What? Which cheese are you going to buy next door? Things like this. So the experience around this doing a launch event, being an introvert and doing a launch event. Wow. Super difficult. But you need to do this, right? You need to push out of these. You can't be locked inside your comfort zones. I have held this idea with me for a very long time that, you know, everything good is outside my comfort zone. My comfort zone is my coffin in a sense, like I'm just comfortable here. But this is not the place for me to exist. Even if just a little outside, I have to be outside it."

So doing these things gave me so much confidence. Like I know that in Bombay, in Delhi, in Calcutta, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in Chicago, USA, in Vancouver, Canada. I can do an event anywhere and I can get a hundred people to come to look at me, to talk to me, to listen to me, and I can talk to them. I did that. I introduced my book. I did a presentation, PowerPoint slide of the book, and I talked about my book for half an hour. I answered questions, all impromptu, because I need to go through this exercise. I need to go through this tough stuff that I don't know how to do, because then I will be a superman. The superman of Malegaon. It was so good to do this, like so much value. Monetary value is there. And this is a monetary value that you will not get as a traditional publisher. You will get your advance against royalties, but they don't tell you your sales. They don't tell you, like, you don't find out until you hit a big number that there are royalties coming to you. Who knows how much transparency there is? Who is to ensure there is honesty in this system? It is just insane. So what this does in my case is, now it's been two years, right? Like you mentioned, two months after the podcast release, you will have moved on, right? I have 100 copies left of my book. I have purposely not sold them. Because the more time I keep them, the more they increase. And today I sell that book of $30 at $50. Because the value has increased."

So I will always hold on to the last 10 books. For this reason, this is my first book. It's always going to have more and more and more value. Today I'm selling according to my worth. So my worth right now for the book is $50. Next year, it's going to rise again, inflationary times, unfortunately. But my point is that I am always incentivized to sell this book. But outside of this particular example. So now when we are talking about scaling, and you're talking about other things. So firstly, I want to put it to you that the idea of scaling again brings us back to the old idea of a book. Let it not scale. You are talking about having value as a writer. Value as a writer does not exist in the printed form alone. Let the printed book never scale. Let it always be 1000 copies. Let those 1000 copies be like the first edition of Charles Dickens. Let all the second and third and fourth editions exist digitally, because that's why your audience is reading. Why not?"

And it's working out really well for lots of artists, lots of writers. Another thing people are doing now is they are they are serializing fiction also. So Substack is incentivizing this as well. And a lot of people are. So the model is that suppose you have 50 people who pay you $5 a month. So $250 a month for one chapter every month, you will end up making by the end of the book, you will make more than you would have gotten as an advance. And now you have printed copies that you print yourself to sell to more people. Meanwhile, these true fans are your PR, there are lots of you will end up making more money this way than you would with a standard advance as a first time author. And then all sales are your sales. Like the biggest point to me is that once you lose track of these numbers, you don't want why would I go to a launch event when I'll never see royalties, like kap dega, kitna dega, 10 dollar dega, dega hi nahi, kya pata, why would I do like I will lose interest and I will move on to my next book. But with the book I have, I always want to sell it because it's my money. It's my idea. It's my pitch. It's my thing. That makes me very proud. It comes with my inclinations and my personality. Maybe there are people who just simply don't want to indulge in these factors. And for them, the traditional path will always exist. It doesn't have to be one or the other. The beauty is that now there are options and options are good for everybody. Because once serialization starts to work, once independent people explore formats, then maybe publishers also these the dinosaurs also decide that achcha kuchh naya karte hain because this has been proven as a working model. And that becomes good for people who do the traditional route. Maybe they have more flexibility. 150,000 words nahi kar paya, chota hi kar rahe hain. Maybe that works out. So I feel like it's good times like I think it's it's and it's good to play games. So I just tell people like you should play games like what is it like don't put such a high premium on the act of doing something on the written word or the drawing like I'll only draw if I have my canvas and if I have all my paints no just be open just draw you're"
