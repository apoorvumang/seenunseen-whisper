It's amazing. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s when the state of the media looked very different from today Everyone got the news from a handful of mainstream newspapers and magazines and TV stations And while there may have been some biases here and there, there was by and large a consensus on the truth All of us lived in the same world But that world has changed. The media is fragmented We all get our news and facts from different sources and there is no longer that consensus We can all choose the reality We wish to inhabit and can find supporting facts from it whether those facts are true facts or alternative facts as the lingo now goes We can all choose to form our own echo chambers and we can all choose to live in different worlds. In all of this What does it mean to be a journalist? Are we all just suppliers? Fulfilling the demands of a particular segment of the marketplace or do we have a dharma that goes beyond that?"

You're not interested in the Northeast, firstly, getting people there, secondly, getting people all excited. Thirdly, what will the advertisers say? So if it's skewed like this, commercially, you're already geared your model around that. Then you have set up 200 crores to set it up while there are 437 other news channels. So you've got your small universe and maybe you're making money. How long? Government changes. Are you going to change? Are you still going to be in the same mode? All those journalistic factors will feed into the larger economic reality. It's about economic. The larger publications are thriving, doing very well. Literacy is growing up, increasing. The newspapers themselves have solid revenues and they have not totally sold themselves down the river. You can still read a newspaper. But worldwide, the bigger newspapers, so many have shut down. So as this kind of digital world and technology world, I'm a dinosaur. But the person who's now 28 already consuming in quotes, the news from those kind of sources is reading everything on mobile.

Now, those ideas are gone, journalists are losing jobs, newsrooms are tiny. So it's going to have a commercial impact. It's a myth to think that setting up a digital site is actually quite a, you know, modest investment. It is not. Because even with those modest investments, you still have to invest in people. And people are very, very expensive. Newsgathering is very, very expensive. But it allows us to be nimble. Sharing is the name of the game. Some freelancer from somewhere will pop up high quality and deliver. A lot of journalists are getting fed up. I want Middle East coverage. I have a Middle East site whom I have never met in my life. I shake hands across the digital world. They say take our stories. So my coverage is going to get beefed up. So that's going to happen. Nimbleness. Television, the first few companies, NDTV, etc., were nimble operations started by independent. They didn't come from Times of India. The Times of India's first foray into television was a flop. Hindustan Times had Home TV. It was a flop. You guys had something in the Hindu, you know, but Raghav came out of nowhere and started this. You know, he's an accountant. And the same thing is happening with digital. So what at the moment we are doing and several others are doing is bringing strong journalism values. You were talking about how you live blog. You may be in a responsible person, but filtration is critical. The processes because there are several fake news while I will tell you, not a single Christian has died in this because Christian missionaries are paying for their Keralite happened. I think people want to read. They love the taste of chutney and they want that chutney, but they can't live on it. So hygiene, news hygiene, nutrition, etc., will have to come in the game. And some will start, some will die. We also lead a very financially precarious existence and all that journalism will thrive, whether it's a blogger bringing news and facts. As you said, we were aggregating just simple facts of what was happening and people's appeals. Now Twitter does it. You can do it via Twitter and Facebook and several other platforms. But media is an extremely dynamic situation at the moment."

On the scene and the unseen, Amit is joined by founder editor of The Wire, Siddharth Bhatia and senior editor of The Hindu, Peter Griffin. They discuss the current state of Indian media and the role of journalists today. This week, Indranil Guha, co-founder of Finpeg, talks to Anupaman Pasa Vesa about Alpha SIPs. Last week on Know Your Kanun, lawyer and host Ambarana took us through the history and scope of Section 497 and the time when adultery was first recognized as an offense.

So when people rubbish it to say, oh, who are these editors on high? The editors on high are people with great amount of qualifications. They have studied the subject or they expected to have studied the subject. Even what they write, forget the reporter, passes through three layers, news editor can look at it and fact check and it comes out after a 24 hour cycle. So that thing that you say, but there is a, you know, I will not name this person, a very smart alecky media commentator, stroke, you know, he writes and talks about the media all over the place, very hip, very, this one said I was at some meeting to audience of students that the day of the editorial is over, editorial comment, because who are these bunch of old farts trying to tell you what you should think? And you know, I can kind of break it down and rubbish it. But basically, what I'm trying to say, filtration in a newspaper is critical, but it was not a dialogue. Letters to the editor and which got cut. And very few people, papers really give it much thought was no dialogue. You didn't like a piece, you lumped it, Twitter has no dialogue.

And for months, we never took a salary, we worked out of each other's homes. When I went to Delhi, I stayed with my friends, they came down, they stayed with me. That's how we managed. Some old karma must have played a role because for about 10 months, or 12 months, we never paid people. And now we do but because we just called in favor left, right and center, halfway through, people realize this was a platform worth writing on. So more people started writing. After about eight months, a high net worth individual came to us and says, I'd like to give you some money. He was turned out to be super generous gave us 50 lakhs. And since then, we've got money from foundations from grants. And now of course, we have a very active online donation program."

But here's my thing, you know, what you just said, both gives me great hope and also great despair, great hope, because it's wonderful to know that there are people for whom journalism is a labor of love, and they will do it no matter what. And, you know, they will fight the odds to do it like you guys started from your homes. But it also gives me despair that one has to depend on the passion of individuals and on, you know, the magnanimity of philanthropists here and there, and the common donor, rather than actually be able to make money from it. And that makes me very sad. And my question here, Peter is, and we were discussing this earlier, is that, look, I think everyone who reads Viyar or who reads Kroll, another excellent magazine, or Pragati Mayur magazine, everyone who reads any of these publications is paying for it, they're paying for it, because they're spending a certain amount of time on it. Time is money, there's opportunity cost, except there's no way for the publisher to capture that value. Now, earlier, the old school value was you bring out a newspaper, readers read it, you capture that through advertising, that is clearly not working. You know, you've worked with Network 18 for many years, and now with The Hindu, advertising no longer is enough to make money of digital media, subscriptions, really, I believe the Ken is doing very well and more power to them, but haven't really taken off to that extent. How do you make money with journalism is my question to both of you."

        "message": "Okay, so, you know, it wasn't just the subscription price that killed that caused the introduction price that caused problems. What came up was that no one, I think, from the beginning, learned how to deal with the internet. Because even if you're paying two bucks for your newspaper, and I could get the same thing online for free, paying the cost of my internet subscription, which was pretty high at that point, you know, prices have dropped there. But we got accustomed all over the world, for the internet to give us stuff for free. And if the internet didn't give us stuff for free, if somebody tried to, you know, charge you money for it, there were others were giving it free. So in a similar way that you couldn't combat the two rupee invitation price, and keep your money because the moment someone else succumbs, you have alternatives who are giving you, you know, your news at lower rates, then the guy who's charging higher will say okay, fine, we don't, even though that's, you know, a trivial amount, it's the cost of a Vodapower at that point, or whatever it is, you would still go to the cheaper alternative. Now, the problem is, I don't think any of us in the traditional media have really learned how to, or what we think enough about the internet. I think that in India, we have had a bit of a cushion. In the more developed parts of the world, newspapers closing down, shutting shop, slashing the sizes of their newsrooms and all of that. In India, we have a few fortunate things happening. One is that we're still a poor country, we're still a country with a large amount of a large gap in literacy. There are new literates coming in every day. We're not a mature market in that sense, right? So when new people are coming in every day, they want something to consume, in terms they want information, they want to be able to read it. And so we have growth, it has given us the illusion that the media is continuing to grow. Because there are new people coming in. And when you come in newly to literacy, you're not going straight to literature, right? You look at functional information first, where do I get what is the price of X? So where do I get good sales for, you know, find my markets for my produce, find out the basic information and then the media delivers that. But we have, we could have been using this time, I think, broadly in the Indian media to figure out how to find paying models. Whether it is as Siddharth was talking about, where you've decided that your funding is going to come from philanthropists and donors, or the Ken model, which is entirely subscription based or the hybrid models or some other stuff we haven't thought of yet. How are you going to deliver that content? We should have been having these conversations and been thinking about it for years now. We haven't because we've been growing in smaller and smaller, you know, jumps, but we've been still continuing to grow. The fragmentation that we were talking about, all the other stuff that comes in, you know, just one little point out there, we're talking about Twitter and everything and the things that all the Twitter and early blogs and everything, all the big accounts, mainstream media noticed them, gave them that and, you know, your credibility came from having been written about the Tsunami Help blog came, got credibility from being featured in XYZ and then the New York Times picking it up and then suddenly we were world famous for like five days, all of that stuff. There's still a huge amount of power in the media is what that tells me. Things are being discussed in opposition to the media, but you're still opposing that thing that's there. It's still important enough to oppose. So that gives me in a strange kind of way, hope that enough people take enough time to combat and debunk or fight against what they see as the oppression."

I think your own newspaper, The Hindu, after seven days, you need to pay to read anything before seven days, if I'm not mistaken, or register at least. Payment is going to come. You can't read the Economic Political Weekly. A lot of people want to read it. You have to subscribe for the online version. So everyone said nobody pays. The New York Times had a huge flop when they tried to introduce payment in the early days. Then they said, OK, columnist is payment, the rest is free. Now only three articles or five articles or whatever. And all the legacy brands around the world in every country, whether it's, you know, Spiegel, or whether it is Le Monde, or whether it's The Economist, The Times, in London, The Guardian, not.

You know, I when I speak to students, I'm reminded of something that I may have read years ago. By the way, I was never told about these things by any senior. There was no mission statement in my organization, or anywhere else. But it gets into your system. But I remember reading, I think it was HL Menken, who said, you know, journalism is about comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. And I think we are comforting the comfortable."

Indian cricket is covered as though we are the greatest in the world. And I'm sorry, we're not. India lost, England did not win alone, we lost badly. I'll end on this. There's a fantastic headline in one of the papers in Shekhar Kapoor's film, Elizabeth went to the Oscars. And it's a foreign production with a foreign cast with a director who happened to be of Indian ethnic origin. And it lost in the mainstream, they got only one or none awards in the Oscars. And the headline in this paper in Delhi was, and the Oscars goes to apartheid. I mean, look at the sheer idiocy about this statement. You have firstly no idea what apartheid is. And secondly, is it racism? Or were they better films? Is the world against us? I mean, this sense of victimhood, this sense of wanting to win all the time."

        "message": "Peter, let's start with you. The hope is that we're having these conversations, for instance, you work with Pragati, which is a startup in that sense, it was a relaunch of the magazine. You're finding ways to fund it. You're sitting here and doing this podcast and have been doing it for a while, have built up readership and are not making money on it. But you're doing it to build an audience. Siddharth and the team that he's working with have found ways to deliver old fashioned journalism in new ways. And as I was saying just a few minutes ago, that people find the media still worth fighting with or against is actually makes me optimistic because there's enough power there. Those are all, I see young people, there are the young people who will be happy to reproduce press releases for sure. But I've seen a huge number of young people who are still burning with that desire to go out there and tell truths, find out, dig. Young people in my organization, interns who are willing to, you know, we had a kid in here who didn't even do a one month internship. She interned with us for six months, doing a full time college course, just so she could get experience and for free, as in she wasn't even getting paid expenses. All these things give me optimism for the future. What makes me despair is this entire thing of this, again, internet enabled, I guess, in some ways, the polarizations that have happened, that we will retreat and be content to have our opinions confirmed rather than challenged. You know, for me, I have always, I mean, this is doing what you, I know you don't like very much virtue signaling, but for me, conversations like this are bloody interesting, because I'm learning about things that I don't know anything about. And it's going to make me sound like I'm trying to make myself look good. But I think there's not enough of that, that we want our opinions confirmed more than challenged, that we want to be made to feel good rather than to learn more. And all of that kind of feeds into one another. And it's sad that as you know, as that was also just saying a little while ago, it's why are people pissed off with the mainstream media, we need to do a lot of introspection on that as well. There are lots of things I think that we in the big media have not got right by any means. And that's why people were so ready to believe the worst of us. And if we don't figure those out and find ways to deal with that, and if we don't figure out how to make it commercially viable to produce good journalism, we're screwed. I hope we will. I hope we will while I'm still earning a salary in the media, and you know, I've not found some other way to make an income."

        "message": "But it makes me worry. So, So despair, I thought I was, you know, spooning out the despair. My despair is, apart from all the things I mentioned is that a lot of fantastic youngsters who are coming to this profession, full of passion, full of ideas, full of willingness to do work, and journalism schools are full as you know, but are either not willing or not encouraged to do walk the streets and get the story. You know, Google, mobile phone, Wikipedia, one court formula, and there it goes. And you need bosses who say sorry, not working. So when I meet a I, we've just taken a guy who will go to extraordinarily remote places and come back with stories on not the usual rural distress and all that. But and not even rural hope. That's the other thing. Everything should not be hope or distress. But come back with state of the ground, a state of the grassroots stories, you know, bread and butter like work. And I if any young reporters listening to me, I would say to her, please go out and report. If you were talking about how you travel down the coast of Tamil Nadu, you were doing old fashioned solid ground reporting, you could have easily, you know, sat there and kind of assembled this that and the other. So I that's a professional despair that really, the hope is equally kind of it's actually connected. I get invited to speak to students everywhere. I'm in Pune day after tomorrow, speaking to you at a university, large numbers turn up. I like to think that we must be doing something which wants them to connect and listen to us, not because we are evangelists. I'm a corporate evangelist because I'm constantly looking for money. But we are not media evangelists at all. But that gives me hope. Public union elections in JNU have given me hope. Not because the leftists won, because they saw something about uniting that these opposition parties have not been able to understand. So all those things give me hope. You know, people say, oh, the emergency all over again, rubbish. The emergency was terrible. Things are not good, but it was terrible. But what really pisses me off and despairs is that the establishment, media establishment is letting down the side and its own staff and its own readers. So this I would end on when I see all these small efforts popping up and when you said somebody is making money on subscriptions and all that they are not successful in a huge way. The Times of India is 180 years old, but by something in a few years, you are going to see more and more youngsters coming in saying, hey, this is not working. I wanted to start something of my own or join somewhere, learn and then go out and do something on my own. So on the whole, I think I've been listening to you intently, Peter. Technology is going to be a huge driver of ideas and innovation. And if those old and new worlds can be married effectively, I think we are on to a damn good"
