Well, you know, I think it's a tricky situation for any government to be in because their very existence is challenged by these subversive ideas such as free speech and people having a voice of their own. So, you know, like you, I started Medianama with no license required. It took me two weeks at that point in time, and most of that was spent in my attempts at designing a site before we launched because a domain name just costs 500 bucks. Hosting with an automated WordPress setup costs 500 bucks, and therefore that gives everyone the opportunity and the right to communicate to anyone who wants to read them. So we find our own audience in that sense, right? You found yours, I found mine, and that freedom is what I deeply cherish. We're reaching a situation now where as more and more people come online, there is fear about what if those people had their own voice and other people and, you know, millions of others could hear what they have to say. And we've seen this particularly in India if you think about it when it comes to stand-up comedy. Just like in the U.S., stand-up comedy has been, you know, a means of dissemination of news and also liberal thought. I think that's what's happened in India as well because, let's face it, us journalists are incredibly boring, and stand-up comedians have a better way of getting that message across. So I don't think it's just stand-up comedy, but, you know, the ability of people to, let's say, put the truth out there is something which scares those who want to control that messaging, and we've seen that happening globally."

The government's philosophy always has been to treat its people as its subjects and regulate everything, every action that you possibly can. And because no one saw the, they didn't see the internet coming, they didn't see this revolution which puts the tools of publishing in the hands of users coming, that to begin with it wasn't regulated. Otherwise traditional media is heavily regulated, free speech in any case is heavily policed, and we were just lucky that this was new technology, and by the time they figured out we'd already started and things had gathered their own momentum."

Just to give some context about how old both of us are, if you go back to 2006, there was this instance where all blogs in the country were blocked. There was an order for blocking all WordPress.com sites, all Blogspot, Typepad, and that was an order that the government issued for blocking certain blogs which they were worried about. And the ISPs did not have any means of blocking a particular subdomain of a domain and therefore they blocked everything. And I think a bunch of us actually led that effort in fighting back.

So if someone goes to IndiaUncut, which of course isn't active, I just archive my stuff there now, but back in the days when I was blogging, and looks at the name and says IndiaUncut, this is definitely a porn site, block it. Then I have no recourse, I can't fight back, and that kind of remains the case to this day, where as citizens, like 69A of the IT Act, and we'll talk about the IT Act, I'm going to ask you about that, has that where the government can block any website and there's no recourse?"

Are you able to access this? And then we go through this entire exercise of asking on social media, can you tell us if you're able to access this site and respond with details of your city and your ISP? And so we have this crazy situation where 20% of the people or sometimes 40% of the people are saying, yes, it's blocked, and the rest are saying that it's not blocked. And so I don't know whether a site is blocked. I don't know why it's been blocked. I don't know who asked for it to be blocked. I don't know how long it's going to be blocked for. When is the block going to be removed? And so one of the things that we expect and we should demand of our government is transparency. If there is speech being curtailed, and if there are legitimate reasons for it, whether if it's a court order, whether if it's due to some national security issue, if my site gets blocked, don't I have the right to know? And so, unfortunately, no one's challenged this secret blocking in court yet, but there is really no disclosure. So therefore, we can't hold the government to account. Whereas, for example, in Kuwait, if a site gets blocked, there is a page that pops up which indicates that the page has been blocked on order from so-and-so, and it gives an email address to contact for more information, hypothetically for also the block to be removed. I remember before the 66A case, I remember talking to a particular site called Mobango. So the shadi.com guys had bought Mobango, which was an app store similar to the Google Play Store, and it was blocked in India. And they didn't know why it's been blocked. They didn't know who to contact. So they went running around trying to figure out. And for six months, it was blocked,"

Wow. So there was private censorship that was going on, but nobody knew about it. And so here's the thing, right? Quite often if a page is blocked, you go and you get a 404 error saying that this page is not accessible. How do you know whether it's a technical issue or it is actually a block? Sometimes you get a standard response saying this website has been blocked on orders from Department of Telecommunications. Why has the Department of Telecommunications asked for it to be blocked? We don't know. I think the point here is that, you know, why we're having this discussion about online content regulation is because the Ministry of INB has set up a committee to frame rules for regulating the internet. And what they're looking at, they started off with regulating news, which is when there was this circular around fake news and therefore regulating both online and traditional media journalists. And, you know, the threat was that accreditation would be removed, among other things, if they were found to be dealing in fake news. And that was pulled after there was a massive pushback from the traditional media journalists as well as online. And then we found that there is a new committee that's been formed specifically for regulating online. The difference between that first fake news circular and this online committee is that the online committee was looking at both news and entertainment. And so it's very different. And if you think about it on the internet, we don't know what is news. We don't know what is entertainment. That definitional issue exists. Entertainment can deliver news. And let's face it, most of the news in India is entertainment or couched in entertainment and news channels run, I don't know, the shows on what Cobra is giving birth to human babies. I don't know what kind of stuff they put on some of the TV channels."

The UN Special Rapporteur on Free Speech, the last one, who is Frank LaRue, also included that in his report on free speech and also human rights and the internet. So the Supreme Court of India said that incitement to violence is problematic and should be stopped. But 66-A had these terms like disparaging speech and annoying speech. Which are vague and can be interpreted. Which are vague and are meant to be misused and those were struck down. So you know, while I think the internet has its problems when it comes to a bunch of issues, when it comes to hate speech, when it comes to death threats, rape threats, when you have instances of, again, incitement to violence, there are issues of fake news and misinformation, there are issues of filter bubbles and polarization, there is a potential for foreign state actors to get involved and change the course of a democracy through, you know, very selective targeting of messaging.

But who is to say that these same tools have not been used in other contexts in the past that may not have received this kind of visibility. What it has done is that it has made states aware of the implications of all of these things happening and therefore they want to develop systems of control over speech, some way of regulating, because the other thing that came through in the 66-year judgment was, and I disagree with this idea, it came from the Supreme Court of India, that they believe that the internet is a new medium and a new technology and therefore there need to be a new set of laws to govern the internet. Whereas my take on this is that if laws are built on principles, then the same principles should apply irrespective of medium. Where the internet is different from other media is the disproportionate amount of scale that it has and the kind of interactivity and participation that lends itself to lack of control and lends itself to more freedom and therefore the state often feels powerless when it comes to dealing with mass movements and mass organizing that happens via the internet. And let's face it, I have been involved in instances where we have used the internet to organize and build campaigns for freedoms, but the same tools and the same methodology has also been used for example by ISIS to bring people over to fight in the Middle East.

That's a mandate that we the people have given the state from that perspective. I mean, I've had this crazy conversation with someone, with actually the head of E-Residency for Estonia, where we discussed this idea of, and it's his idea of transient citizenry. You should be able to very freely and very easily move in and out of being a citizen of a country and you should move to the state that serves you the best and that leads to states being competitive. You know, we talk about competitive federalism within countries, but there is also this competitiveness between countries at a global level to retain talent.

I think one of the fundamental things that people are missing during the current debates is that it is not just this government you're fighting. It's overreach and power in general, that governments always tend to overreach. And on that note, I want to take you back to the IT Act in 636A and the fights that happened there. Because as we discussed when the internet first came, like the IT sector itself, one reason the IT sector did well, the field was so new that there wasn't regulation in that much stifling regulation in place as there is in other sectors. But the government soon went about amending that, changing that. And one of the ways they attempted to do that, and by the way, the rationale that you mentioned for we need to regulate the internet because it's a new technology, large reach, etc., has essentially been used through the ages for every new technology. Like, for example, our censor board exists because in the early 60s, I think it was when that court case happened, the government basically argued that, look, cinema has a much wider reach than books and therefore we need to censor it and treat it in ways different from books. And the same argument was made when the Gutenberg press was invented about books, where they said that earlier, you know, books would just go by hand and people would copy it, but now it's been printed and reaching wide dissemination and we need to control that. And so, like you correctly said, I mean, this fear on the part of governments is natural because, hey, they want to protect their power"

I mean, if you talk to police officers and district collectors, you will realise that their job is to maintain law and order in that area. They need to save lives. And their logic is that by shutting down the internet in this area, if I'm able to save one life, how do you put a value on that?"

In that case, you know, they can't treat everything like a natural disaster. Although quite often when mobs go on rampage, they treat it like a natural disaster. No one is accountable. It was an act of nature. In the same way, you know, like when a message starts spreading, if it's a fake message of, let's say, between one religion, someone getting raped because of a religious identity as a revenge of some sort, right, it's going to incite communal passions within those communities. And under those circumstances, the district magistrates, they don't know what to do. They have to prevent the spread of those messages. This is one of the reasons why we've had the highest number of internet shutdowns in the world, in India. Like 70 last year, I think there have been over 40 already this year, including, I think someone mentioned yesterday that just day before yesterday there were three shutdowns. Some of them are for nonsensical reasons. There was one instance where to prevent people cheating in exams, they shut down the internet somewhere in Gujarat. And, you know, there are laws in place, there are rules in place. The government doesn't necessarily apply them in a manner which is in line with their own guidelines.

Now, that was disrespectful, but it was clearly not violative of Article 19.2.

And so that was the sheer single case of this young lawyer from Delhi, you know, who had some legal backing as well in terms of great support. She went and filed a case for getting this declared unconstitutional. There were other cases also that had been filed and they got clubbed with this case. So there were other ITI cases on Section 79, Section 69 as well.

Right. So when we ran the Speak For Me campaign at that point in time, that was a story of now kicking in saying here's the deadline.

In some instances, obviously, there have been military coups, etc. But typically, long-term sustained tyranny has crept up and you haven't realized that it's hit you because then they avoid giving people that moment. And quite often, when it comes to attacks on freedoms and attacks on free speech in particular, we tend to keep moving on to the next one and the next one and forgetting the ones that got left behind. So sometimes it takes this one case and one instance which galvanizes a lot more people together to push back. So here's the thing. I think this attempt to regulate online content, I feel that it is just as worrying, if not more, than the net-utility issue. Because net-utility was about the ISPs controlling what you can and cannot access and charging you differently for what you want to access. This is looking at creating a framework for controlling your speech. This should matter more to people. So why there isn't as much of an outrage now is something I don't quite understand. We saw, for example, there was this huge outrage about encryption a few years ago where they were saying that all your WhatsApp messages you have to store copies in plain text form. It's a stupid policy that came out of the government. Immediate outrage, immediate withdrawal. If you remember porn ban, huge outrage in a country as overtly moralistic as ours."

        "message": "but I don't agree with it. Do you? So, I think there needs to be a pushback against self-regulation because of a number of issues. Number one is that it creates a distinction between the Internet that we get access to in India versus what we get access to across the globe. So, our exposure to perhaps content from across the globe might be impacted by people who do not conform to these guidelines. And secondly, what would happen is that there would be content that we want to consume here that is legal for us to consume over here. But because of overarching guidelines, I mean, you've had instances of innocuous words like breasts being censored on TV and in films. Chicken breasts. Chicken breasts, right? So, I mean, would you want Netflix and Amazon, etc. to start doing that? Think of people who want to watch Game of Thrones on Hotstar. You remove the nudity from that, so either you blur it out or you cut those scenes. And when you cut those scenes, then you lose the context of what's going on. So, I mean, there's an old question about what is art and what is obscenity in that sense, right? And so, I think we would be worse off in terms of getting access to the kind of content which is legal that we should be allowed to watch because of a nanny state. Secondly, what would they do about those players who choose not to become a part of this self-censorship regime? Would they be blocked in India, right? So, the internet was meant to create that competitive marketplace where if there are consumers who want access to that content, everyone will have to evolve to providing them that kind of content. Here, it's going to happen in the reverse, that it's going to get blocked if it's not a part of that. The third point is that it actually then takes us down the road of enabling government regulation. So, you have self-regulatory mechanisms in, for example, the News Broadcasters Association where channels who do shows on snakes, human babies, and shit like that, don't necessarily, they're not a part of the News Broadcasters Association, so they're not governed by it. And so then, for those who choose not to be governed by this, will that then lead to the government saying, oh, the self-regulatory mechanism is not valid, it's not working, but we understand that you want there to be regulation because you already have a code, now let us put our own code together. And then we effectively open the doors for regulation through self-regulation. Instead, if what we need to do here is push back on principles. So, number one is that there is no distinction between news and non-news content, frankly. And news is not the exclusive prerogative of journalists. Anyone on the internet can disseminate, can report news, anyone can have an opinion. That's the freedom that we have on the internet, which we don't have in print or on TV. In the sense, there's also, there is no distinction between a journalist and a non-journalist, between a journalist and an entertainer, between a stand-up comedian and a news anchor. These are all distinctions which have been made irrelevant, which were, there were roles and positions that were created through the implementation of control over who gets to communicate. I don't need an accredition to launch a news site. A stand-up comedian doesn't need a license to go and showcase his short film, right? And I think that's the beauty of the internet. We don't want to lose that nature, that it's not, you know, there's a distinction that's being made between professional content and user-generated content. On the internet, all users are both creators and consumers. Everything is user-generated content. So, therefore, when you start slicing it up into pieces, that's when it falls apart."

It's much better to take a stand on principle that, no, this doesn't need regulation and there will be no regulation. Once you agree that some regulation is required, but you say, we will do it ourselves, then, inevitably, the government will step in and find faults and say, look, you are not being able to do this because of X, Y, Z, but you have already agreed regulation is required, so let us do it. It's much better to fight on first principles and say that no regulation is not required, we will regulate you, not the other way around. And the second point is that I think, you know, there's this famous poem by Pastor Naimoler that, you know, first they came for the Jews, then they came for blah, blah, and by the time they came for me, no one was left to fight for me. I think whether they intend to or not, they might be achieving a similar effect here when they have all these categories of news and entertainment, and, you know, one of the questions that you asked yesterday, the cunning devil's advocate questions was that what if they'd come and tell the big players that, don't worry, we won't touch you, we'll go after the small fake news guys first. And the thing is, this is very cunning because this is going to end in a Naimoler kind of way where first they came for the small fake news guys, then they came for the entertainment, and when they came for the news, nobody was left to fight for us. And instead of this, we all have to band together and say, forget the categories, forget the ideologies, forget everything you believe in, just fight on this one principle if you agree with it, that no regulation."

And that's actually a part of the process of, you know, gaining greater control, because if people don't know what the truth is and they think that and they like, I think someone is mentioning that in case of Reddit, the organization is discredited, no one judges the content on the basis of the legitimacy of the content. So the source is actually delegitimized. And so I think we are still facing this problem as a country, as a democracy where news itself has been delegitimized. Many news organizations have helped do that because of the kind of entertainment that they have run on their channels. And so there is also this counterpoint that, you know, perhaps there needs to be a better control because that also has an effect on society."

For me, at one level, I do believe there's a need for regulation of large platforms because of the disproportionate ability they have to control narratives and speech and access to speech. And we need neutrality in the access to speech for people to get the right kind of information in order to make better decisions. And if someone is controlling their access to speech, then they're controlling the way that they're thinking. So at some level, I think we need to enforce neutrality amongst these organizations. And also, I do believe that we need to prevent mass targeting and mass personalization and behavioral targeting of citizens. And business models of advertising need to change because it is the blind nature of advertising that is taking us down this path where people are able to make money by facilitating or spreading fake news because there is no distinction between real and fake when it comes to the advertising business."

So if you prevent the collection of mass and very granular personal and behavioral data, that is going to address micro-targeting to quite an extent. If you ensure that people have choice about deleting their own history and therefore not feeding algorithms or keeping the algorithms or allowing the algorithms to profile them to a greater extent, then again you will be able to prevent personalization at that level of scale where there are filter bubbles that are created. So to each of these issues, there are solutions. So for example, if you see, Facebook actually deals with hate speech a lot better than Twitter does. So from a self-regulation perspective, I think it is up to organizations to change the way they work in order to ensure that there is no need for government regulation. And unfortunately, many of these organizations, including Facebook, have failed. They rode their luck for too long."

You don't specifically need to regulate the media or free speech for an instance like that. Agreed. But apart from that, the point I sort of made yesterday was that people often assume that when you talk about regulation, there are only two options, which are government regulation or self-regulation. To me, the best kind of regulation, the natural regulation, which leads to self-regulation but is an overarching thing, is competition. And I'll clarify on that when you talk about seeming monopolies like Facebook. Competition is the best regulation because markets sometimes have a bad name, so you can call it markets or you can call it civil society because markets are nothing more than a web of voluntary actions of people in civil society, citizens like us. And I think you see this playing out in the sense that after the outrage over Cambridge Analytica, Facebook has actually made efforts to do something about it that at various times, various platforms have been responsive to what consumers want. And I think as somebody made the point on the panel yesterday, part of the reason they do so is because advertisers are leaving, but advertisers are leaving because users are pissed off and therefore it comes back to civil society. I'm not so sure. I don't quite agree with this."

And so you and I may have different definitions of the market in the same way that you could say that\u2026 would you say that, let's say, if there is a single telecom operator in the market, it is effectively not a monopoly because it is also communicating with\u2026 direct verbal communications or it's competing with telegraph and mail for communication. So, definition of a market, I don't quite buy that argument of defining the market\u2026"

If you're\u2026 you can always define markets differently to suit different needs and it's a valid thing to do, but regulators have to look at it from the perspective of how is this impacting a particular market. So, for example, and also regulate for harm. So, let's take WhatsApp, for example. It was determined by the competition commission of India that WhatsApp has a dominance in the Indian market when it comes to messaging. They did not compare it with SMS because it deemed that rich text messaging, which WhatsApp is, is different from what regular text messaging is. But it also determined that WhatsApp had not abused its position of power. Now, I think it's very clear that we are running the risk of many of these large platforms abusing their position of power. And like I said, then we cannot, as a nation, we cannot depend on the benevolence of these platforms to maintain our freedom."

Because in this case, what it would do is government is not, you know, a benevolent beast that sits upon us and will act in our best interest. Government ultimately is a parcel of interest groups. And what happens when you give government power, when you give it the power to regulate something, is that where there is already a power imbalance, you are further empowering this specific set of interest groups, whether they be political or commercial or whatever, against others. And accountability in practice simply isn't there right now. And government failure is ubiquitous. Market failure is relatively rare, if it is there at all. And I would just say that all regulation that happens has to be non-coercive and has to come from civil society. If companies break the law, sure, prosecute them. That's the job of the state. But if they don't break the law, if you don't, if it's a question of preferences that I prefer this algorithm to that algorithm, there shouldn't be coercive pressure. It should be the voluntary actions of people which indicate what happened. And we can obviously disagree about how you define markets and monopolies. And I don't think either of us have a solution to the problem that we've sort of been lamenting over this period of time."

So if you can define certain harms and define the laws under which those are governed and ensure that platforms, so for example, if it's hate speech, if it's death threats, if it's intimidation, if it's incitement to violence, even if it's criminal defamation, which I principally disagree with, there are laws for that. And I think it's just about then holding platforms to account for it."

It's understood that the state's job is to maintain the rule of law. If the company breaks the law in any way, then obviously the state does its job. But if it's going to sort of regulate and give licenses or say that, no, you have to bleep out the word breasts, it's not allowed, then that doesn't break any law. And that kind of regulation is what I'm against. I'm not saying there should be a free-for-all where everybody does everything. I'm saying the rule of law. Again, I think that a lot of the laws that regulate free speech simply should not exist. And I know you agree with me on this. But the question is not about the rule of law. We need a state which has the capacity to maintain the rule of law as strongly and firmly as possible. We don't need regulation beyond that, which I think is what you're saying."

But I think one argument which also keeps coming up is, and from the traditional players, is that the need for regulatory parity between offline and online, in which case what we have and the problem that we are facing here is that the traditional media is heavily regulated. It is over-regulated. So their argument is you need to, so there are two ways of doing it. Either you reduce the restrictions on traditional media or you increase the restrictions on the Internet for that regulatory parity because I do also agree with this notion that you're effectively advantaging the Internet versus traditional media."

The interesting thing here is that I was at a TRI open house on uplinking and downlinking of TV channels about three odd weeks ago, and there both Zee and Star argued for deregulation, saying that we shouldn't be treated as broadcasters. We are content aggregators, and we need to have the same freedom as online players do. We need to have the same freedoms on traditional media platforms. And the other thing that came in was interesting, was that all of these codes, and like uplinking and downlinking are permissions, they're not licenses apparently. And this was brought in because the government did not know how to tax foreign channels that were being downlinked in India. So, what was brought in as a means of getting revenue and effectively tax collection also lent itself to being a means of controlling whether the channel goes live or not. And we know that there are, for example, I mean, this is generally talked about in the media circles, is how Raghav Behl's Quint and Bloomberg Quint, their licenses have been stuck for quite a while."
