I find it hard to get things started, or to keep them going once I do get them started. It was different with the seen and the unseen. When Amit Doshi, who runs I.V.M. podcast, came to me and asked if I wanted to do a podcast with him, I said no. I didn't listen to podcasts, I didn't understand why other people listen to podcasts, I wasn't interested. But he persisted, and I mentioned an idea I had for a TV interview show I wanted to do one day, called the seen and the unseen. He said, hey, let's do a podcast instead. And I figured, yeah, television wasn't happening anytime soon, so why not, let's jump into this. We did one episode, then another, and another. And here we are now, 100 episodes. The basic principle that got me here, take one step, and then just keep putting one foot in front of the other. There's a life lesson in there that I need to learn from."

I don't like to celebrate my birthday and so on. But I thought the least I can do for my 100th episode is get a special guest on the show. Not some celebrity superstar or a big public intellectual, but someone with whom I can always reliably have conversations that are special, at least for me. My guest today is my good friend, Shruti Rajgopalan, who teaches economics at Purchase College in New York, but happens to be here in Mumbai now. So this is actually going to be a face-to-face conversation, unlike the Skype conversations we usually have. I think this is her 8th appearance on the show, and quite apart from the fact that she is so brilliant and insightful. I think it might be because she is the one person I know whose views are closest to mine. We agree with each other on most things, which leads to two possible reasons for why I like having her on the show. One, she validates my sparkling insights. Two, she confirms my biases. I'm inclined to think it's a former, but that could just be my bias. Before we start shooting the breeze though, a quick commercial break.

I don't think of these things very critically in terms, I'm not judging every guest and every person. I usually think of it as, you know, some kind of a learning exercise that usually most of your guests have an insight that I wouldn't have thought of. And even if the insight is, you know, very straightforward, and it's a simple idea, they bring in a particular amount of context to the area of the world that they're speaking about, which I learn a lot from. So I usually think of this in a sort of professorial way of how do you more critically engage with ideas. I'm not very critical about the guests. I'm my favorite guest on your show. No, I'm kidding. I have a few favorites. I really loved Gunwant Patil. I think he was amazing. What I loved about his show was he has recognized the first principles of liberty and markets, but not the way I did, coming from books from Adam Smith and Frederick Hayek and Frederick Bastiat and so on. It's sort of like farming. He's sort of homegrown, you know. He just, through experience, he's figured out that state coercion has really led to the misery of farmers. And instead of treating the symptoms the way most of the elites want to treat just the loans or just the subsidies, he has really thought about the core problem, which is that farmers are denied choice. And he was so eloquent about it. He is by far my most favorite guest."

Our good friend, Barun Mitra, had organized his farmer's conference in Deolali in Nasik, which had a bunch of these Shedkari Sangatana leaders who'd worked with Sharad Joshi. And he wanted Bharat to meet India, in his words. So he took a bunch of English-speaking Bombay people along, me being one of them. And the fascinating thing I realized there was, you know, I always had the impression, which I now realize to be mistaken, that our ideas, being so counterintuitive, will necessarily be the ideas of the elite. And when I got there, I realized that, my God, that, you know, the way we view the world, many of these farmer leaders, like Gunwant Patil ji, Manvendra Kachole ji, and a bunch of, you know, really fine, deep thinkers, the way we view the world is pretty common, in the sense we've arrived at the same place, but in different ways. I've arrived at there by finding these ideas in books, thinking, ha, this makes sense, and then applying them to the real world, and over a period of time, they kind of get validated. These guys don't care about the books. These guys have seen, you know, life playing out and affecting them, and from that, they've come to these, what we would call libertarian conclusions, that, you know, they've reached Hayak without reaching Hayak, they've reached Friedman without reading Friedman, which is just, which was incredibly fascinating, and that was the one Hindi episode I did, because I just wanted him to be comfortable,"

I even had a 10-minute episode with Mohit Satyanand. I remember. Which is a miniature masterpiece, but it's a miniature. And then my episode with you on Right to Property went for an hour, and I thought, what a nice conversation this was, you know, and why am I doing 20 minutes? And then as I became a regular podcast listener myself, and started binging on other interview shows like Sam Harris and so on, I realized that, hey, most people who listen to podcasts regularly listen at double speed. So if you have a 20-minute show, by the time you've put on your shoes to go jogging outside, the 10 minutes are gone. That's double speed. It's all over. And the kind of podcast I would crave to listen to would be two-hour conversations, three-hour conversations, like Sam Harris sometimes, Joe Rogan, or Dan Carlin's Great Hardcore History podcast, and I thought I need to do more of those, and we reached a stage where now I aim for a minimum of an hour, otherwise I feel like it wasn't rewarding enough.

And later my husband pointed out to me the same thing that you said, that it's double speed, and he said traffic is so bad in most places that it's not like you're getting anywhere from point A to point B in 10 minutes. So most people are stuck in a car or some kind of mass public transit for at least 40, 45 minutes, and that seems to be an unexpected boon for podcasters."

We've all had the days when your mother said take half a bucket of water and you're done. So it just resonated with me, but the types of ideas he talked about, again, were just so ground up, no pun intended, and so sort of counterintuitive but very practical. And his general theme that we need to keep it local and involve local communities, I think that is an underappreciated idea in India. We want Sarkar to do everything and Sarkar usually means some centralized power.

With the FSI episode, what I really loved about it, and this you see in a lot of Alex's work, it's, I mean, after all, their site is called Marginal Revolution, a small step to change the world, right? So it's a small idea which could completely change many things. It can change the architecture of Bombay, right? We live tall instead of live broad, right? We live in smaller clusters. We think of distance very differently. We may start walking to work instead of taking a car to work, right? Prices may drop, so there's more mixed living in the sense that, you know, the person who comes to drive my car, the person who comes to do the housekeeping at home doesn't have to travel an hour in a local train to come and work in our homes or something like that. So, you know, it becomes more affordable. And then, you know, cities, as a landscape, they generate ideas. Cities are basically labor markets and they're innovation markets. What kind of ideas can be generated if you're not spending all our time in individual silos and cars on the road and instead spending it in communities, spending it in public areas, spending it walking around, spending it listening to podcasts and in closer proximity with other people? I think there's also a huge equalizing factor. If you look at cities like Hong Kong and New York, which are tall as opposed to sprawled out, everyone at every income level has to interact with each other. I go to the Metropolitan Opera, which is a fairly elite sort of interest, even in New York. And the moment the opera is over, everyone is walking out to the same subway. And there is something very lovely about that in that we genuinely, despite our income and class differences, we can genuinely interact with each other, make eye contact when we're in the same subway compartment and things like that. So a simple thing like changing the FSI can have very long-term consequences on the kind of spontaneous order"

Reclaim the sky. You know, we are restricted by how much land we have access to. Don't think of reclaiming the sea or reclaiming land. Reclaim the sky. Just build upwards. And all the typical objections fall apart, which he sort of addresses in that great episode, which was one of the early 20-minute episodes.

The number of times like some RD Burman riffs plays on radio, this is all because that is what is instantly recognizable. You're sitting in the car most of the times when you're listening to the radio. And you want people to tune in, which means they have to have either celebrity interviews or something like this. And your show could be wonderful on radio. Like it could get this fantastic market if it could be broadcast over radio waves, but it simply cannot be done. And the problem is exactly the same as what Ashok Malik discussed with television."

I mean, the idea is pretty simple. It is a direct transfer of public wealth, but we keep saying this is our wealth. These are public sources, but they are not controlled by us. They're controlled by representation of us, which is the government. So they really become the play thing of those few people in power, whether it is Indian forests, Indian mines, Indian roads, Indian land. I mean, we're in Mumbai. Half of the town part of Mumbai, the southern part of Mumbai, is state land, right? Whether it's the port or whether it's all these LIC buildings and all these old buildings. And that's a lot of locked up value which the state has no business holding on to. And Rajesh Jain's simple idea is we need the state to divest this wealth and put it in a fund and transfer it one time to every single family in India. And it has to be equal. It has to be non-discriminatory. And it is really the people's wealth and people will know how to spend it better."

But that was two hours long and everybody said it was too short. I wanted more of it, which is uniformly. And the thing is, you know, like I've told Rajesh and if he's listening to this, I know he won't mind my saying it, but I don't really think his specific short-term plans or what he's doing with Dhanwapsya are going to work at all. It's like almost a fool's dream. But where I appreciate what he's... I used it as a phrase, I'm not calling him a fool. Far from that. But what is important about the venture, nevertheless, is to make that conceptual breakthrough. Because most people just think that all the wealth that they have is the wealth that they have, you know. If they're poor, they're poor. But what Rajesh is trying to get across to you is that, look, our public wealth is so much that every individual is actually worth, you know, 50 lakhs or even more than that. And all of that is being wasted. And it's time to give some of it back to the people instead of just lying around. Especially in a poor country like ours, where, you know, poverty is still a problem we are trying to tackle 71 years later. So just conceptually in terms of realizing that the government is not a separate, mybop entity and what it has is what it has. Realizing that, no, the government is your servant and what we call public wealth is actually our wealth. It's our debt capital, so to say."

So I think about it in terms of the value of ideas and not how quickly this can turn into action necessarily. And there are ideas for whom the time may not have come yet, which are not popular enough. But nevertheless, I think this is something worth thinking about. And even if Dhan Vapasi by itself doesn't happen, the change in mindset that this is our wealth, they simply control it and we need to take back the control, I think that idea is very powerful. Right? Whether we redistribute 15 lakhs or 50 lakhs or whatever the number is or how it is done and whether it's an entitlement or a transfer, those are things, you know, which are less interesting. But I think that a simple idea is so powerful that this is really our wealth and it must be returned to us in some way. It's been taken away from us. I don't think Indians think that way. Right? It's usually government's wealth and we are clearly not participants in the government because they only think of citizens come elections. Absolutely. Another big idea, I think, which has a huge impact and India really needs is the episode that you did with Parth Shah. He's another old friend, a common friend of ours and I think what Parth is doing with the right to education and school choice is extremely valuable and I think the two-fold idea, you know, one that the right to education is simply driving out the private market because it's trying to... The Right to Education Act essentially defines all education goods as inputs. Right? What is a good school? A good school is one which has a playground, which has bathrooms, which has windows of this size and which has a midday meal and, you know, so on and so forth. According to me, a good school is one where the children learn"

So this mindset that you can have a good school only if it checks off all these boxes and it looks like a good school. Right? And this is, again, typically a problem of elites making policy. They go to Norway or Sweden or wherever and see what good schools look like and then they turn it into policy. The trouble is a lot of great learning takes place in tiny budget schools which cannot afford windows sometimes, which cannot afford, you know, a good teacher-student ratio or cannot afford a good student-to-bathroom ratio and so on and so forth. And they are providing a better service. We know that for a fact because poor parents are willing to pay a few thousand rupees in these budget private schools rather than send their children to a free school. I mean, that is damning evidence. I don't know what could convince people more that our public education system is failing. So I think Part's episode on how the right to education is really denying education and how we need to bring in school choice, which is another one of the themes you have spoken about for more than a decade. I think that's a very powerful episode. I think there is an entire generation which has been lost and I think more generations will be lost unless we fix that."

Yeah, that was excellent and this sort of conceptual breakthrough they're trying to get at is that, look, the quality of education and the choices that is involved in where the kid goes to school should not be determined by a Maibab state but by the parents because they have the best incentives. Every parent wants his kid to get the best possible education because they want to get a better life, right? And one school vouchers, which I'm no longer convinced about despite being an advocate at one point, but I think there is, anyway, that's a different subject, but they're certainly better than the current system and what school vouchers do is they empower the parents and it's the parents who have the power of sending the kid wherever they want rather than the state.

Poor people know much more than us about the world, I think, because they navigate a very different world, which is much, much more difficult. But most importantly, they know about themselves, which is knowledge that we cannot have. That knowledge is so subjective and so contextual. It is not possible to replicate that. I'll tell you an interesting story. I read this in Dean Carlin's book. So Dean Carlin is an economist and a policy person who wrote this book with a co-author. The name is slipping my mind. The book is called More Than Good Intentions, right? And he's basically talking about all the randomized control trials and other kinds of research that they've conducted in developing areas and some of the broad lessons that they've learned. There's a lovely story. I think it's about a flower seller. I think her name is Vijaya in the book. And they talk about how, you know, they go to Vijaya and they explain this whole micro credit thing. And Vijaya's daily routine is as follows. She goes in the market, you know, she wakes up in the market at four in the morning. She'll go to the wholesale flower mandi. Before that, she will stop on the way to the money lender and she will borrow money on daily interest, which as you and I know, can be extremely, it's a very expensive way of raising money. So she will borrow money in the morning. She will go to the mandi. She will buy the flowers. She will sell the flowers through the day. Whatever additional money she makes, she will stop back. You know, the money lender's right there. She'll go back. She will pay it back. And with the remaining money, she will, you know, buy her daily groceries and so on. And they did the math for her. They sat down, they explained everything and they said, you know, we will give you some micro credit. But if you don't borrow every day, you save X percent in daily compounding interest, which is very expensive way to do business. And before the end of the week, you will be putting away 50 rupees. By the end of three weeks, you will have 150 rupees. And then that is enough for you to buy the flowers in the mandi on a daily basis. So they laid it all out for her. And she said, all that's fine, but I can't keep any money at home because my husband's a drunk. And the only way he can be disciplined is because he knows that the money lender's guys will be after us if you don't pay the money lender back. So we think that she needs to optimize on how she does her flower business. But she's optimizing on three problems. How to run her house, how to control her husband's alcoholism, and how to run a successful small, you know, sort of, I don't know if you can call this a business, but a small entrepreneurial venture of selling flowers daily outside the temple. And we simply don't know what her optimizing function is, to use a typical economist term, right? If you don't know what it is that they're trying to optimize, how can you tell them how to do it? And that's why a lot of these patronizing people who sort of typically say, but they don't know better. You know, even if I had looked at Vijay, I'd be like, yeah, that's a terribly silly way taking money on daily interest. And my first assumption would have also been, maybe she doesn't know that there are other alternatives, right? That's our natural inclination. All of us who have access to modern credit, we all have credit cards, we just paid for our lunch with credit card and so on. So that would be our natural inclination. Our natural inclination is never to think that there is something about their circumstances that they know so much more about that we can't possibly fathom. And they must be doing what is best for themselves. And this is not to say that we shouldn't have financial literacy or education programs and so on, but they need to be the ones who apply the tools of financial literacy."

I mean, one major problem for Vijaya, presumably, I don't know much about her life, but presumably she can't get rid of her husband, which would be one way of solving the problem, right? Another way is we need to have a better credit system, which is more competitive at that level so that money lenders are not charging daily interest rates, right? If we had banking penetration at that level, if we had more microcredit associations and organizations who gave credit to women, which we've had, right? We've had this in Ahmedabad, we've had this with SEWA, we've had this in Bangladesh, right? He even won the Nobel Peace Prize for the microcredit work that he did in Bangladesh, Eunice. So there are ways to make this happen to make this particular problem less of a problem. But I think what is happening with Vijaya is a lifelong problem of having her choices taken away from her, right? I'm not sure how much of a hand she had in whether she gets to choose whether she marries or not, or who she marries or not. I don't know if she had much control over whether she can get educated or not. I don't know if her family skilled her in anything except household work, right? So I really don't know enough about her life to actually think of every single thing that has gone wrong that could have had some intervention and been fixed for this to not be a problem."

And I think in 2018, the penny might have dropped for many people that Modi is also going to be more of the same. And this is not because there's something peculiar about him or something similar about him to other dictators slash prime ministers that we've had. It's just simply the incentives are terrible.

But the problem there is that a lot of the ways in which they've recast themselves is for me a step back, in the sense that there is a soft Hindutva, where instead of, you know, just speaking of individual rights, and so on, as they should finally do, despite not having done it for seven decades, he goes to Kedarnath and when, you know, there was this fuss where the BJP accused him of eating chicken. And instead of just mocking them, as he should have, he said, No, I had shudh veg and defended himself. And so this coating of the soft Hindutva vote, then getting into all of these populist areas, like now farm loan waivers have become the rega. And I understand that farm loan waivers might even be a necessary anesthetic. But there are deeper structural issues that you have to take on. And those structural issues were actually caused by the Congress, but forget the past. But Modi's done absolutely nothing about them. Despite blaming Nehru for everything, he hasn't actually reversed anything Nehru did. So what are you blaming him for?"

And even when he's been asked questions this year in press conferences, he's been lauded for about Indira Gandhi's policies, he's defended bank nationalizations, he's defended the nonsense he did. He even said in a press conference recently, just three or four months ago, that the Congress was not involved in 1984. Now, I think what a lot of Congress supporters don't realize is that when I call him stupid, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.

It's also, you know, I mean, these are small things, just the peace of mind for people who have a different orientation, their ability to hold someone's hand. I mean, there's no way we can value these things as economists, right? These are just really big milestones for regular folks in India. And I'm so thrilled it's happened. And all the people we know who belong to the LGBTQ community, we are relatively elite. You know, we have not known too many people who've been extorted or who've been harassed by the police or molested even, you know, out of fear of being outed and so on. But this obviously, you know, the more powerless you are in India, that usually translates into the less money you have, the more you face these things. So I think this judgment brings about equality, not just between the different genders and different sexual orientation, but it also reduces the gap between people who are elite and powerful and could have led these lives anyway, even with 377, which was a terrible law versus, you know, poorer folks or people who don't have that kind of safety and security in the environment that they inhabit. So I think it's just a really wonderful thing."

So yes, technically it's a contract and technically one should be able to decide the terms on which you dissolve the contract and triple talaq is as good as any, right? But that is not the case in India. Most of these women did not choose who they were married to. The circumstances are such that they don't have much control or much choice and they are denied consent all the time in small and big things.

So I'll quickly give a shout out to them before we continue, which is Amit Doshi of IVM first came to me and his creative director, Thomas also sat together with me and we worked pretty hard. And initially we did like five or six pilots, which was a disaster because we were not looking at it as a straight up interview show. It was like a produced thing where I'll talk about something and there'll be soundbites from various people. And I remember you also gave soundbites and it was a disaster. And then one day I decided to hell with it, I'm just going to sit and talk with someone and that's the episode we'll put that. And that kind of worked much better. I have had three producers in the time that I've been here, first day was Joshua Thomas, who's now moved on and is heading the Indian Express podcast team, wonderful guy, who's also played the guitar a couple of times where I've tried out these little spoken word things in the intros, extremely embarrassing now that I think about it. My next, my second producer was a gentleman named Abbas Momin, who's in the studio now, who at some point got bored and decided that I am not producing the show anymore. I would rather produce Cyrus Says. And he left me for Cyrus Says, at which point I'm funnier than Cyrus Says, if inadvertently, at which point my next producer was Swati Bakshi, who recently left to pursue further studies abroad and Abbas is now back reluctantly, though he tries to smile now and then. All the illustrations that you see are done by Aleka Gupta, very quiet, unassuming person who just, you know, I'll give illustration ideas and she'll pick one of the ideas and she'll execute and it doesn't even need to come back to me to see it because she does such such an amazing job.

Like whenever Andrew would be served at a restaurant or, you know, an auto driver would take him somewhere and he'd be like, thank you, and he'd mean it. But Indians, if they say thank you at all, say it in a very pro forma way. And I don't know if this is a Protestant value or a Judeo Christian value or whatever it is, but people in the West just seem to say thank you and mean thank you, feel the gratitude more than people here do. And we were trying to figure out why could that be? I mean, is it is it a cultural thing? Is it because Indians have, you know, grown up in this zero sum environment where everyone is just going grab what you can, or?"

You know, when I was talking about this just a couple of days ago, I can't remember with whom, with Pranay Kothasthani, another common friend and a wonderful guest on your show. I was in Bangalore with him, we were having breakfast at MTR, a meal I thoroughly enjoyed. We were talking about how there seems to be division of labor, right? Lots of people working at MTR, but the division of labor is not the market division of labor. Person who takes your order is different from the person who serves you, and is different from the person who cleans the table. And it's not because there is so much business that they need to divide. It's because the person who takes your order will not touch the dirty dishes. Wow. Right? There is a deep caste element to this, which is in front of us all the time, which we just don't notice because we're so accustomed to it, right? And because we're fortunate enough to be on the right side of that divide, so we can ignore that and pretend it doesn't exist. There's a lovely Akhil Katyal poem on that, actually, which I can't remember the exact verse, but it talks about how a young person doesn't know his caste and he's 12 years old,"

It's called Order Without Design. It's by Alain Bertot. I'm not sure if I'm saying his name right. He's at the Marion Institute at NYU. And he has a lot of experience in urban planning and policymaking. And he's basically talked about how cities are emergent orders and how we think we can design cities top down, but it never works and usually has terrible consequences. I am really trimming the inside of his book into a couple of sentences. His book has great stories. It talks about the mill land, which was locked away, you know, because of industrial use and, you know, prime Mumbai sort of real estate. He talks about Beijing. He talks about cities in Indonesia. He talks about New York. He talks about a lot of cities. He has such fantastic insight. And I had the opportunity of interacting with him a couple of times. And his basic idea is that we need urban planning to sort of delineate what is a public space and what is a private space. And that's where the job of the planner ends, in a sense. They shouldn't dictate what one must do with a private space, right? This can only be a restaurant. This can only be an art studio. This can only be a residence. That is a really bad idea. And it also hampers cities from functioning the way they should function, which is as in, you know, enormous labor markets and innovation markets. So that book is really lovely. It provides a lot of context, very insightful. Another book, though it came out last year, but I must mention that I've had a new appreciation for it this year with all the elections, is Milan Vaishnav's When Crime Pays. I think it's an extraordinary book. It basically talks about the nexus between criminality and politics, how Indians manage to elect criminals and not criminals, you know, who are criminals like Gandhi and Nehru were for protests or civil disobedience because of criminals. They have kidnapping, you know, extortion, murder cases against them. And his idea is that, you know, it's more beneficial because of the way campaign finance is set up for political parties to have criminals because criminals come with their own funding and elections are an incredibly costly business. And the second part of it is individual citizens vote for criminals because they can get things done because of state capacity being so low. You actually want to vote for the local dada or the local goon because they will be able to get you your Tadkal passport or, you know, get something fixed or get you your ration card and so on and so forth. Right. They are the problem solvers."

And I found The Power Broker an absolutely mind blowing book because it wasn't just a biography of this one man. It was also a biography of a city of New York City. It was a chronicle of a philosophy in top down design, which is that kind of high modernist planning where you plan everything and there is a restaurant and there is this and we need bridges and demolish all these neighborhoods because we need to do this there and so on and so forth. With Jane Jacobs fought against arguing for the organic growth of cities. And it's also a fascinating character study of how power corrupts, of how someone who starts out as an idealistic young man wanting to make a difference can become this absolute immoral monster by the end of it."

I had shoulder surgery last year and I asked them, I said, why is this door like this? A lot of like elderly people in the building, why can't we just change it or fix it? And they said, we can't touch it. It's landmarked. So, you know, the show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, one of the outdoor shots is of my building. Right. And my building is in no way exceptional. It's quite ordinary. It's from a particular time, the early 1900s. And there are plenty of those buildings, all of the neighborhood, and they are all landmarked, which basically means that you can't change anything. It's a privilege of the elite to enjoy historical landmarks. These are not even that great. And it prevents incumbents and future innovators from building new and better buildings. And this is a sort of like Moses thinking versus like Jacob's or Hayekian thinking. And you're absolutely right. So yeah, I mean, Order Without Design also has a lot of Jacob's insights."
