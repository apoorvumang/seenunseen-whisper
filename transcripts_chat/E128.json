I can't quite say but I'm an Indian and like all Indians at some level or another I am a migrant my guest today is Chinmay Tumbe who teaches at IIM Ahmedabad and is the author of a marvellous book called India Moving India Moving is a history of a country on the move it documents migrations out of India, into India and within India and tells a story of a society that has always been in flux it's a riveting read as a book of history and it also carries much sociological insight into what makes us what we are a nation shaped and defined by its diversity before we get to the conversation though let's take a quick commercial break I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love the book I want to recommend today is by an author who is an Indian favourite certainly of my generation when we were growing up it's P.G. Woodhouse and the name of the book is My Man Jeeves but there are plenty of other books by him on Storytel and remember you get a 30 day free trial only at storytel.com slash IVM Chinmay welcome to the scene and the unseen thanks so before we kind of start talking about your book tell me a little bit about yourself I mean you've written a book on migration are you a sort of migrant yourself?"

But most importantly, for the first time Delhi is connected to both figuratively, you know, the East Coast and the West Coast. So this opens tremendous opportunities of maritime trade, merging with inland trade. So till then it was always separate. You also had urbanization in the sense a lot of large cities coming up of Delhi, but also by the end of the period Surat and so on, as a result of which a lot of people started moving to these places. And finally, there's also pilgrimage networks, which started and you had different religious, not maybe faiths, but philosophies. So you have the Sufi wanderers, then you have the sort of Vaishnav, Pushti Margi Vaishnavism, which is a new form of philosophical thought, which emerges. You have this Sikhism emerges, a religion. And all of these, I argue, actually, a lot of these religions had a much more benevolent outlook towards not only trade, but also migration. And so they weren't less taboos of sort of moving in many philosophies. So arguably, the pace of mobility increased. Note also, there's time of a lot of warfare. And so there's what economists would call as a military labor market. And this is different because you have full time warriors. But when the size of the army grows, you also need to have part time warriors. And so you also have like agriculturalists coming into warfare. And many of the dominant, you know, sort of warfare, warrior groups of India, consolidated themselves in this period, like the Rajputs and the Marathas, for example. And this is important because some of these mobility streams continued well into the recent past, that is, we're talking 200 years earlier. So there's some districts of India, which supplied the soldiers, you know, in Saran, for example, in Bihar, supplied the soldiers to the Shersa Suri army, then the Mughal armies, then the British, the Bengal native infantry, and then much later to the industrial sort of mills of Calcutta. So the same region, sending out people, and that becomes a sort of pattern for many parts. So the development of a military labor market in this medieval time, city building, which became very big, and this integration of inland trade with overland and overseas trade. So these sort of three major factors really boosted mobility in a big. Note that the speed didn't change much, essentially, for until the advent of the railways, the speed of the horse was the constraint. But because of this demand for variety of economic sort of needs, mobility increased tremendously."

It's almost like there's a gig economy and you can just turn on an Uber for warriors and figure out which is the most profitable war for you to go to. Another thing that struck me is very interesting, and I hadn't really thought about it in this way before, was that a lot of the urbanization, like you point out in South India was temple generated urbanization, you know, benefiting merchants and artisans, whereas typically we today we think of urbanization as driven by economic imperatives, you want to form larger economic networks and so on. But, you know, religion being a force in both urbanization and migration was really interesting. What I also found fascinating was your whole account of slavery. Like, typically, when we talk about slavery, we obviously imagine the American South and the Civil War and so on and so forth. But India was a market for slaves in both directions. Tell me a bit about that."

Different types of slaves, we are accustomed to thinking of slaves usually as men, but in Indian history also a lot of accounts of female slavery, whether it's in the Chola Empire, the Rajputs, the Mughals. So women slaves have always been there. In this time period, for roughly 15 to 18th century, especially when in the US and South America and North America, this transatlantic slave trade really began. India really, you know, developed two or three major circuits. One was from Africa to India via Arabia. And the most fascinating community, which exists till date, is the Siddhi community, who trace the ancestry to this sort of group. There's a famous guy called Mallik Ambar, who becomes this big noble in the Ahmednagar dynasty. And he comes from Ethiopia to Arabia to what we would call as Maharashtra today. And he comes as a slave, and he rises up to be a fairly rich man with a lot of power. And Jahangir hates him because he's, you know, thwarting the Mughal attack in the Deccan. And his descendants, you know, I mean, the community has a huge setback. The slave imports stop after they sort of lose wars. But the community still exists today. And so in some parts of the Africa, in Gujarat, for example, even Maharashtra, you'll find black skin people of African ethnicity living today. And I work at IIM Ahmedabad, and our logo actually comes from the Siddhi Saeed Jali Mosque, which is designed by these artisans coming from this community. So I often tell students, actually, that, you know, you have to really think twice before selling fair and lovely, because you have, you know, the logo of your institute was designed originally by a descendant of a black African slave. In terms of slavery on the other side, and this is a less known fact, one theory of why the mountains Hindu Kush are called so low is because they were killer of Hindus, in the sense, Hindu slaves being taken over the mountains, because of the cold. And so there's a huge slave market also of Indians, or people, mainly Hindus, being taken over the Hindu Kush to the slave markets of Persia and Central Asia. So there's a circuit from Africa and Arabia coming to India, but there's also a circuit from India going into Asia. Again, even in North India, slave dynasties existed. So very interesting ways in which slavery existed, of course, very harsh. But I would argue compared to the US experience, or the experience of the American world, a lot of avenues for upward mobility, which we've still not really found in the American world. I think that's a distinctive aspect of slavery in India. Many people have been able to break, it was never sacrosanct, you could always sort of rise to the top. If some accident happened,"

But there are a lot of, again, and this is the thing, some social groups started moving more, and some social groups are moving less. And the less ones are people who are sort of negatively impacted were precisely those groups who are historically always on the move. These are basically the nomadic groups, and the most famous being the Banjaras, famous in logistics, all different names in different parts of India. In Hyderabad, you have the Banjara Hills, for example, which comes from that. And the Banjaras, you know, are really affected, because one, the transport systems are being shifted. So there's a technology shock. Two, there's a surveillance shock where they need to be settled down in different places. And you can really see sort of, you know, communities getting poorer as a result of this. So this is one way in which a lot of communities became richer, thanks to colonial rule, but some communities became poor. And definitely the ones which are on the move historically, definitely saw a lot of, and they're some of the poorest social groups even today, in India. And I was just coming from Dadar, and the other station, the porters, even today, they trace the ancestry to this group.

One is the Aryan migration hypothesis many thousand years back. And then you come to the 19th century and people talk of indentured migration. And that's about it. And my reason of and this is a course of contribution of this book is to give a phrase to one of the world's greatest migrations. And these are migrations, which are male-dominated as there are three core features, male-dominated, remittance-based, semi-permanent. And they're happening pretty much even today. So, you know, when you see the Ratnagiri people in Mumbai, most of them do not settle down in Mumbai, they go back. And this has been happening since the middle of the 19th century. A lot of my research has been to document these regions, which are these regions, go there and find out more. It's remarkable, almost the entire West Coast on one side of the Western Ghats, from Ratnagiri to Kanyakumari a part of this, a large part of the coastal tracts on Eastern India, a whole chunk of Eastern UP, Western Bihar, Uttarakhand, pretty much all of Central India and the Deccan is actually out of it. They were not really affected by it. So, this is a story of mostly coastal India and the lower Indo-Gangetic belt. And what happened out here is that a lot of initial recruitment took place in the colonial era, not necessarily by force. Density was very high in these places. But these migrations have now led to a culture of migration, where young boys grow up thinking that they will spend their lifetime outside and come back. That's also key. And girls grow up knowing that they have to look after the family and land when their husbands are away. And it's so strongly rooted in many parts of India. And my sort of estimate suggests that, you know, these districts, if you have more than 150 districts out of about 600 districts of India, which have this. Another way of saying it is there are regions covering over 200 million people, which are completely remittance-based economies, principles of economy runs on money coming from outside. And it has been going on since more than 140 years. So, if you compare it with other epochs, this actually turns out to be the largest and longest. The largest migration right now is the urbanization of China. So, China has, you know, taken hundreds of millions of people out from farms to cities. But that's happened in the last 30 years. What's happened in India, much smaller compared to Chinese urbanization, but it's been happening for more than 100 years. So, the classic indicator for this is the sex ratio. And in India, you know, we typically, sex ratios of 800, 900 females to 1000 males in some parts as well. And we're used to this phenomenon of the missing women. But Ratnagiri, many districts in India have the phenomenon of missing men. And in Ratnagiri, for example, sex ratio has never dipped below 1100 females to 1000 males. So, it's a female surplus because the men are working outside. In fact, you point out that"

You would think that, you know, fertility reduces because the men are away, but that's not the case, because as I argue, you just need one good night in order to sort of, you know, get a kid. And these migrants do come back. It's not like they're away for years, they come back at least once or twice a year. So it's remarkable. As a researcher, I thought fertility would be affected. But clearly, you know, Bihar has very high fertility even today. We might think that women would get more autonomy, in the sense that the men are away, so they'd have to take more decisions. And that is true in some parts of India. But on the whole, not much has changed. What has changed on the West Coast, is that with some decent governance, they've been able to use this remittances in a smarter way. And you could say that migration has fundamentally transformed this region for the good. In Bihar and Eastern UP, however, it's been much, much less."

And again, they had a massive sort of natural calamity in the 80s, because of which many people went out. Many of these other regions also, there were a lot of famines in the late 19th century. But it's almost all of India is affected by famines. So it's not just the fact that there was something bad. There's a negative shock. But at the same time, like you said, happenstance, where they find an opportunity. And that is the combination which clicks. So while famines affected pretty much all of India, it's the coastal areas, where they had the opportunity to go to Burma, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, or anywhere to work, that they found this safety valve, where they realized that if there's a famine, they could always go there. Whereas much of Deccan India, though there was famine, they tried to move, but they couldn't, you know, get an opportunity to latch on to. And as a result of which, even though they had negative shocks, they didn't sort of cultivate these migrations, cultivate these migration networks, so much.

And my question really isn't about the child migrants, but that's an interesting thing in itself. But it's about how a common thread through all the communities and peoples that you describe in this, whether it's the Parsis, or the Sindhis, or the Marwaris, or the Gujaratis, all of whom we'll talk about later in this episode, but a common thread to all of them is the force of community as a force multiplier, so that if you want a better life, you just see where your community has gone. And you can be guaranteed that you'll go there and you'll either get a place to work and learn the trade as in the case of an Udupi restaurant, or in the case of say Marwaris or Gujaratis, you might even get funding from those community networks. And what therefore happens is that number one communities tend to specialize in certain kinds of trades, or vocations. And this almost then seems to have, in a way, a ghettoization effect, like I was chatting with a friend who was brought up in Surat on the show, in fact, I did an episode with Aakar Patel on Hindutva. And Aakar was brought up in Surat. And while he was describing Surat, we realized that Surat was both simultaneously globalized and ghettoized, that you had communities from across the world kind of gathering there to trade and to intermingle, but they were also deeply ghettoized.

And so the number one reason is marriage rules. It's also linked with the age at marriage. Even today, Indian women, for its sort of per capita income, marry at an extremely young age. We say, you know, 18 is a legal age for women to marry. But when you look at surveys, the median age for marriages among women today is 18, which means half the population of India today, even today, women marry below 18. And this is the way community has its grip, you know, because if you can control marriage, and if you can control marriage within your community, that's how it remains close knit. The minute sort of women, for example, can work till 25, 30, and then choose their own partners, if that freedom is given, then this community network breaks down. So that's the big trade off. And I would, of course, argue that, you know, women should be working or should be getting married by much sort of later age groups, and so on. Of course, the strange part about this is that, as you said, communities work as major agents of subsidies. They subsidize accommodation, food, networks, especially if you're going. And so what's interesting is some of the social groups which have been not in business, or not in sort of the, you know, money making activities, the way they've stormed these things is using the network, and using the community. And so you'll see this in the Sarashtra Patel's move from farming to business, the Gounders in South India from again, farming to business. And now slowly, some sort of what people are calling as Dalit capitalism, where Dalits themselves are using the networks. And so when you have some a body like the Dalit, you know, DICI, which is a Dalit industry in Chambers Commerce of India, it's basically a front just as you would have a Marwadi Samaj, for example. So they've realized the power of the community. And so what's interesting to me is that everyone now in India is trying to come up through a community ladder."

But historically, as you point out, at various points in your book, it's much harder for someone from a lower caste to really come up because there are barriers to entry. For example, if you want to be in the diamond trade, you basically got to be one of the Palanpur regions, and so on. So what you have is that, you know, the trade at the Marwadi's control, or the trade at the Gujarati's control, or, you know, across those, they almost have a stranglehold on it, where it's very easy for someone from their community to get a step up and become prominent. But that kind of upward mobility within that specific trade is much harder for somebody from the outside. And as you correctly point out that one reason why the lower castes both migrated less and benefited less from migration is because they didn't have access to these networks.

The first people in Singapore, for example, from the British side was the Bengal native infantry, and these were soldiers recruited from Saran. And so in the 19th century, some of the major sort of infantry stock was coming from Saran. And as British rule sort of consolidated, so actually the demand for army personnel sort of started reducing. In fact, if you compare the Mughal army and the British army, the British army is very thin. And so this whole military labor market, which had developed was beginning to collapse, which means people who are on the move historically had to find new vacations. And so people from Saran actually got hold of the jute mills in Calcutta. And so they became just like Ratnagiri labor fueled the cotton textile industries of Bombay. It was Saran labor, which sort of got hold of the jute industries. And one company, for example, Saran labor from across the 20th century, I think it went from being about one fourth to three fourths of the workforce. So again, a very strong network built between Saran and Calcutta. The fourth district I talk about is Ganjam in Orissa. And I call it cyclone psychology, because Ganjam is a very unfortunate geography. All cyclones tend to end up, you know, battering Ganjam. It's faced some sort of a super cyclone once in 15 years. And so 100 years back, they were going to Burma. Today, they go to Surat, Gujarat, work in a variety of, you know, urban sectors. In Surat, it's the synthetic textiles and so on. But it's a culture which kind of has come to the conclusion that if we just focus on agriculture, it's very risky, because the super cyclone is going to come once in 10-15 years. And so migration, relatively, is a very stable livelihood strategy. It can be harsh, it can be exploitative, it has all the social costs of separation, loneliness. But given the realities of climate, it's a very safe and I would say smart strategy that they've sort of developed over the last 100 years. And in all these places, they have the money orders, they have the migration songs, the folk songs. So this is a huge sort of, it's very similar. I mean, if you go to Ratnagiri, if you go to Ganjam, if you go to Udupi, if you go to Saran, differences in development, but that migration culture that you'll find that the kind of conversations are happening,"

So when they did this migration survey, they had to actually keep an option, you know, where are you outside India, they had to keep an option saying no man's land. And that was that returned the most number of sort of responses. There was a Goa migration survey done and they found that in taluks like Bardia Salset, about one third of the households were receiving money from outside. That's pretty much the same number in Kerala or Ratnagiri, that's mass migration, however you define it, where one third of households are receiving money. And that's happening in Goa today.

And that's because, of course, a lot of the population permanently left after this Portuguese separation to Portugal, Mozambique. But a lot of Goans also started developing new things, because it became, it faces massive tourism boom. And so a lot of construction activities started happening in Goa, etc. Vizag is another place where a lot of people used to leave, they build the port, and they start more migration towards Vizag rather than from it."

Immigration is people coming in into India, for example, Nepalese or Bangladeshis coming to India or Mexicans going to US, so they're called Mexican immigrants in the US. And we say migrants or internal migrants for, you know, people within the country. You might ask who is a migrant? In the census, there are two options. You can be a migrant based on the place of birth, which means if I'm born in Pune, and I'm living on the day the census officer arrives in Bombay for more than six months, six months is the cut off, then I'm a migrant on the base of place of birth. But you'll see that suppose I was in Pune, and I moved to Bombay, spent 10 years, and I went back to Pune. And if the census officer asked me in Pune, you know, what's your place of birth? I say Pune, and I'm in Pune, then I would be not a migrant. So in order to capture moves, they ask you a question, what is your last place of residence? And so in that case, technically, you should be saying Bombay. As it turns out, there are a lot of biases in migration surveys. And Kerala is a classic example. When the census and the National Sample Survey asks, you know, question, what is your previous place of residence? Now, we know almost a third of the workforce of Kerala has a Gulf connection. But surprisingly, very few people answers saying that their last place of residence was the Gulf, because for them home is Kerala. As a result, in the census and the National Sample Survey, we find very few, you would conclude that there's very little Gulf connection. There's another survey done by a research center there, a large sample size, and just a very specific question. Have you gone to the Gulf? And how many years you spend there? It turns out one third of the population has a Gulf connection. So it matters as to how you ask the question, and how a person relates to a particular place."

But it's a case of a highly educated state with less job opportunities. And so you've seen a lot of educated young people leave Kerala, both men and women, and go all across India first. And then in the last 30 years, the Gulf and then US and variety of places. Interestingly, the Gulf story starts with Mumbai, the first recruitment offices of the oil companies were in Mumbai in the 1930s and 40s. And interestingly, they had some norms as to who they could recruit. And so it was the Keralites in Mumbai who got those jobs. And that's how the network started. And so from Mumbai, the locus shifted to Kerala. And that's why you have, you know, this massive Kerala when the Gulf started booming in the 70s and 80s, when oil prices boomed, construction activity started, and this Kerala connection was formed. And so today, in popular culture in Kerala, you know, massive, massive migration from Kerala. Of course, now there's a lot of migration to Kerala as well, because Kerala is fairly rich, they don't want to do the low end jobs. And so you have the curious case of more than 2 million North Indians now working in Kerala. And there's just a Malayali movie just released where the film sort of breaks into a song.

One way to see it is when, you know, Gandhi and the national movement, one of the first sticking points for them was the indentured migration, and they got it banned, they got it abolished in the 1910s. But the interesting thing is when they got indentured as a system abolished, but the migration didn't stop. People continue to move, they switch destinations, but they start, they continue. So the pressure to migrate was always there. Apart from indenture, of course, it's exploitation on a day to day basis, people eviction, you know, insecure sort of land rights, as a result of which migrants in India, they lead fairly insecure lives. That is why this connection with the home is so important, because they know that they can always fall back on something. And so they never really snap the connection with the rural place, even if an entire family has moved. For example, my father's side family comes from Udupi. And it's the rare Udupi family which actually settled in Mumbai. I mean, of course, there are lots, hundreds and thousands of Udupi families which have settled in Mumbai.

And the postal money order was remarkable, because it's the first mass financial instrument, which everyone could relate to. India had a unique system. In 1884, they realized it was launched in 1880. Four years later, they realized that most of the recipients were women, they were not coming to the offices to collect the cash. So they changed the system to make it home delivery of cash. And as a system, a unique system only in India, which survived until it was shut down, the entire system was shut down a few years ago. And so for more than 100 years, you had a system of home delivery of cash. And that's why the postman became this symbol in many parts of India, of like this Messiah, because he would come, he would undo his bag, and there'd be money, there'd be physical cash out there.

And I want to quote from that, and the quote is in your book. Quote, these Marwari's leave their own country for the purpose of trading and they are spread all over Hindustan. A Marwari's shop may be seen as a hamlet, may be seen in a hamlet consisting of only four or five cottages. In fact, were you to search all Hindustan, it would be difficult to find an agricultural village without a Marwari. When they arrive here, they commence by selling gram. And in the course of four or five years, they become opulent bankers. The causes of this are they unjust dealings. Therefore, my advice to my countrymen is this, that they avoid entering into any transactions of this nature with such deceivers as these. Stop, quote, and fall. My Marwari listeners, these are not my words. I was quoting from the Times of India. And this takes us back to a sort of this very suspicious outlook towards trade. Again, you quote from the Arthashastra, which is, you know, 1800 years old, which also refers to traders as, quote, all thieves in effect, if not name.

But there are also cases in history where there's anti-capital migration. And the classic example is Marwadi migration in India. And in the Bengali nationalist PCRA called them parasites.

        "message": "double the size of the international diaspora. Yeah, this is actually not well known. For example, the number of people who speak Bengali, there are more people speaking Bengali within India, outside Bengali heartland than outside. Like me. Yeah, you wouldn't have thought I was Bengali, right? And this is also a surprise for me, except the Malayalis, I think. The Malayalis have this massive international diaspora. But it was most Indian linguistic groups have a larger internal diaspora. And this is important because often the internal diasporas, firstly, what is a diaspora? A diaspora is basically a scattering of a particular, you know, identity, whether it's a language or ethnicity, or religion. And if you see the global diaspora is about 25 million, internal diaspora, linguistic, I say it's about 60 million. And the internal diaspora is like a launchpad for the international diaspora. Often, like we said, you know, the Biharis who are now going to the Gulf, are going via Kerala, through networks cultivated in Kerala, the Gujaratis who went outside, Bombay was a major launchpad, for example. So this is this matters, you know, these these small sort of connections matter. The international diaspora is varied, it's so diverse, you have the old diaspora, that you can call it the plantation diaspora. So they were mainly sugar plantations. But there's rubber plantations, tea plantations, coffee plantations, and these are the guys who went to Mauritius, Fiji, and so on. And in a lot of those countries, Indian ethnic Indians now make up more than half the population. The new diaspora can be summarized as a U-turn, U meaning three U's. So that's US, UK, UAE. And these three countries specifically, you know, today attract a lot of Indians, a lot of investment, a lot of overseas investment, a lot of remittances comes from those places. And today, India, you know, earlier, they've also concerns of brain drain, and so on. Today, nobody talks so much. And the fundamental reason is India is today the world's largest recipient of international remittances, and you get more than $70 billion from people outside. It's about two to 3% of India's GDP. I mean, it's a huge part of the balance of payments. Without it, India would really be struggling. So we've kind of recognized the contribution of migrants from coming from outside. And a lot of this money comes from Gulf, which is on, you know, which also has a lot of low skilled labor. A lot of it comes from the US, which is at the high skilled labor. Today's diaspora, however, slightly different from the old diaspora, because it is much more elite, in the sense the guys who are going out are disproportionately drawn from the upper castes. Religion wise, it's different, because in the Gulf, there's an over-representation of Muslims, in the US, over-representation of Hindus. But caste wise, there's this massive Gulf, which was not the case 100 years back, because it was almost like a cross section of an Indian village would be found on a boat going to Fiji. But today, when you see the plain, it's not really a cross section of Indian society. So it's much more elite. And in the US, like the political scientists, Devish Kapoor and others have called it the other 1%. It's really an extremely elite diaspora. So when we say, you know, Indians are so brainy, or a classic comment I get is, you know, Indians are very good at mathematics, and they're looking at"

But Malaysia, Singapore, especially are still very strong. So today, I mean, outside the three U's, Singapore definitely is a huge hub for Indians, a lot of Indian entrepreneurs, businessmen. And it's here, when you talk of diaspora, inevitably, we start talking about the Sindhis. Because the Sindhis are a group which have become so transnational. I mean, virtually every country, Gujaratis and Punjabis, I would say, Sindhis, Punjabis, and Gujaratis are most transnational. And then the Malayalis and Tamils, of course, Karnataka is to a slightly less extent. What's interesting is Bengali diaspora, of course, we add Bangladesh, it's very wide. But the sort of more recent sort of migrations have been more internal. That is, you know, from West Bengal to different parts of India. But again, what's not changed is that Central India, this whole arc of the Deccan Plateau, and Northeast India, like 100 years back, they are really not into this international migration in a big way. Why do you think that is? It's again, these historic networks, I would argue that. So less opportunity, therefore, basically, more like, yeah, the coasts have had sort of starting advantage, because they've had these old ties. And so they've just been synced with it. Because remember, the British Empire worked from three ports. Delhi came much later. It was Bombay, Chennai, Calcutta. So the coastal sort of India had much wider exposure to trade ideas, movement for international sort of connections than the hinterland. So there's this clear bias towards the coast rather than the hinterland. In sort of independent India, apart from Delhi, and now much more recently, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore. But apart from that, there's a huge part in the center, which is kind of been sort of ignored. And with migration, you need information. And so it's only now that the information is percolating.

For example, the Brahmins have this classic grouse that we were forced to move because of reservations, you know, there's this huge identity around that. So I think these are the sort of different tensions in which each community is facing. Some, which justifiably have been exploited for long, and some which now feel that they're being exploited, even though there might not be any evidence on that.

But the multiple partitions you sort of point out, you know, the Bangladesh in 71, the Burma just before that, and all the displacements, for example, in 1990, the Kashmiri pundits being forced to flee. Another striking statistic in your book is about how two thirds of the people in Delhi are in some way migrants, especially in 1951. Yeah. And do you think that lingers on through the generations?

It was a horrendous incident, this whole Kashmiri pundit exodus. But fundamentally, it's the same reasons. It's hyper nationalism in Kashmir at that point. It's hyper masculinity, aggression. And unfortunately, this is being repeated now in different ways in India. Partition, you're absolutely right. For example, the RSS would say that, you know, it is us who actually protected people at that point of time. So, you know, a similar thing in Bombay. A lot of people love the Shiv Sena because they say, you know, in the 90s, during the riots, it's the Shiv Sena who stood up and protected us. And so this becomes a very solid part of the identity building process. And so there's a clear connection. I mean, Sindhis, for example, very, very closely aligned with hardcore nationalist feelings. There's also the case in the case of Sindhis of trying to prove themselves that they are Hindu in a very, very strong way. And so this kind of seems to dominate a lot of the logic because a lot of people, because they're often being taunted as being coming from the other side. And so in order to sort of dismiss any notion of that, it kind of go to the other extreme and say, no, no, no, we are, you know, you need to assert your identity even more. So I do think some of it comes apart in that way. I don't know if there's any empirical relation, like on average to Sindhis, you know, are they more nationalist than others? I don't know. But I can clearly see the reason why. And there's no, for example, Kashmir Pandya, it's very clear cut. It's a solid injustice which has been done against them. It's still not really been solved.

I mean, he's not called an environmentalist then, but I think it's the harmony. And even today, you'll find this return to this idea of environmentalism that, you know, this rural life is much more, is less polluting, etc. In the book, I make my position very clear that I take the Ambedkarite view that India needs more urbanization, not less. More people have to move to cities. And ultimately, it's coming from Ambedkar's perspective. Because if you look at caste-wise urbanization, you know, people, if you look at social groups as these small concentric circles, it's the well-off have these wide spatial networks, their concentric circles span the world. And the social groups where these concentric circles just span a few villages. And if India really has to flourish, one, these concentric circles have to start interacting, but they also have to start widening. And that's what migration brings about. And so what India really needs is more rural to urban migration, of course, of the safe kind, not exploitative, and so on. But to have a blanket policy saying, you know, we should have reverse migration, or let's... And the other thing is, I think what people have failed in this Gandhian world of rural development is the basic flaw in the ideology that is rural development almost always gets more, gets you more migration. That is, as people get rich in rural areas, they actually leave. And you've seen this in coastal Andhra, where people became very rich, high productivity, and they start moving to Hyderabad, US, because as you get richer, you're not going to farm work, you're not going to do backbeating from, it's a basic."

And, you know, you're seeing it in India, it's still very slow in India, compared to in China, because as I say, in this book, the great Indian migration wave means people also go back. So it's not that people are coming and setting in Indian cities, a lot of them spend their life here, but they go back. So India, in a way, has an inbuilt check on permanent migration. I argue mostly it's coming from the source region, women are moving less. Some of it is also housing, high exorbitant costs, people can never really put a foot in the city. So these three views of the nativist, of the completely sort of celebratory account of migration, safe migration, which is Ambedkar, and Gandhi in the middle where he loves the idea of, you know, ideas moving about, or even people moving about. But fundamentally, the focus is always on the village. And if possible, there should be no cities, everyone should be living in the village. And Ambedkar would never support that. And the three positions are, for me, very fascinating. And for Ambedkar, of course, the crux of this was caste in the sense that if you move to the city, you would sort of weaken your caste in it. Now, it's a good question to ask, has caste really disappeared once you move to the city? And I don't think so. But I would argue it's less. I think that that's the whole"

And there's a lot of evidence now suggests that the anonymity, it helps our entrepreneurship, it has a variety of things. So overall, this this romantic idea, which policymakers in India have had for a long time, that is, you know, if we do enough in rural areas, people won't have to move. have to move, is fundamentally flawed. In fact, if you do enough in rural areas, people will still move. And the rural areas will also then consolidate into urban areas. Absolutely. Yeah. And which is happening, you know, you see these small townships and so on"

You know, one of the very interesting things that you say in your book, which kind of seems obvious now in the light of current events, but if you told me this 15 years ago, it would have seemed very counterintuitive. And I would have said no way, which is that just as you point out the major ideological battle of the 20th century was between capitalism and communism, your sense is that in the 21st century is likely to be between cosmopolitanism and nativism, which we see playing out all around us, but is nevertheless still a little surprising to me, because you'd imagine that as we become more urbanized and cosmopolitan and globalized, there'll be less chance for nativism to rear its ugly head."

        "message": "Actually, I mean, this is not completely new. I think I mean, I use that sentence, just because in the 20th century, capitalism can be very strong. But you did for a brief moment in the early 20th century, also have this battle between nativism and cosmopolitanism. For example, after the Great Depression, or actually after the First World War, there were these massive racist visa walls that emerged, blocking off, you know, migration flows in Europe and US. So this is not the first time, and there have been people like Trump before. But because this economic ideological battle is pretty much done and dusted with, there might be new ones which might emerge in the century. And because we have this massive backlash against globalization, remember, it's more backlash against globalization of people. There is, of course, the trade war and the capital flow war. But between the movement of people, goods and money, or capital, political sort of position is towards the first, slightly less against the second. And on capital, nobody's talking about stopping capital flows. Everyone loves that. But it's the people which people have a problem against. And so, you know, I mean, this is a battle that's going to really rage on. And we've seen it in all the elections across the world. In India, where immigration is such a huge issue, it was never a political issue for a central election. This time, you know, it also mattered to some extent. And so I argue that, of course, there's a bias. I myself happened to be born in Mumbai, cosmopolitan city of India, maybe Asia. But I in this book is a celebratory account of cosmopolitan. It's a defense of that. We benefit from ideas transferring. Some of these ideas may not be good, but, you know, you might even have counter ideas coming from these exchange flows. And I think history serves as a nice reminder that especially for social groups to rise, migration is very important. And if not for any other reason, I think that's one of the reasons why one should support mobility."

And the reason is because the earlier linguistic barrier, Hindi speakers trying to learn South Indian language is kind of broken, partly because now the wage difference is so high that people don't mind learning these languages. And so you're finding, you know, Bhojpuri Bengali speakers who are learning Tamil or learning Malayalam or who are working without these languages because they're desperate for good wages and they're getting very good wages. The added benefit being that the South has better labor laws. So they're actually also getting better labor protection than working in say, Gujarat or Maharashtra."

Until now, you've not seen any political movements against migrants, thankfully. But this is definitely a feature. And so the great Indian migration wave, which I argue went East 19th century, West 20th century, is now going South. Then there's a point of climate, climate change. And you're seeing crazy temperature variations. It's going to affect agriculture. Historically, migration has obviously been linked. Even the Arthashastra has a mention of what kingdoms should do in terms of famine, move the kingdom to another place and so on. So that's, you know, very climate change, especially because the flooding, you know, if the sea levels rise and so on, Bangladesh is a low-lying place. And so that's like a, you know, huge hotspot of migration. And third is, of course, also expats, you know, of international immigrants coming into India. And so far, we've had Nepalis and Bangladeshis in large numbers. But with India growing, you'll also see immigrants coming from Europe and US. You see that in a few cities, but it's still in the few thousands. And this could dramatically grow up in 2050. You might find, you know, walking down the street in Bombay, and you might find literally a lot of races, which you're not seeing today. In a way, it would be a in a way, it would be a return to the late 19th century."

And I have had the opportunity to travel a fair bit in the world. And every time you travel in India, it's just something new that, you know, opens up. Writing history, especially for a general audience, has been really fun and also a real eye opener. Because there are many aspects of history where, you know, I also had certain preconceived notions. And when I sort of dug in more, I realized, okay, hang on, you know, need to sort of look at this in a very, very different way. So yes, I think it's been a very fun process overall.
