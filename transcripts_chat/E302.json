        "message": "What goes into the making of a life? Sometimes, when we look at someone at a particular point in time, it might appear that they are who they were meant to be. This could be hindsight bias in play. In hindsight, we see events following a linear path and everything seems bound to happen. That's never the case. But having said that, it also may not be the case that everything is random and anyone could be anything. We do have an essential nature, even if that essential nature is itself accidental, and the paths we go down on conform to that. Now, many of the episodes I've recorded in the last couple of years have been like oral histories and have an element of the memoir to them. And one common pattern I have seen is that my guests never planned to be where they landed up. When they were young, they did not have some grand bird's eye view with which they planned their lives. Instead, they were often locked into a moment they did something that made sense at the time, and one thing led to another. In fact, I invite you to think about your life. Are you where you plan to be? How much of it was intentional? If you had to do things all over again, what would you change? These thoughts came to my mind because this episode features a remarkable guest with a remarkable life. And speaking to her, it's clear that she did not set out to be remarkable to be a brave dissenter to go to prison for her beliefs. Instead, she always followed paths that interested her, that were authentic to herself, and to the moment. And then life happened. And here we are."

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Trishta Settleward, who most of you will know as a human rights activist who has relentlessly fought to get justice for the victims of the 2002 riots in Gujarat. She succeeded to some extent, but the fight continues, and she even spent some time in jail recently, persecuted by a regime that she continues to fight. But Trishta is a lot more than just a bleeding heart activist, and her activism involves a lot more than the 2002 riots. She was born to an illustrious family of lawyers and could have followed in those footsteps and lived a plush life. She loved to write, and she was interested in politics. Her first published letter to the editor in 1978 protested the authoritarianism of Indira Gandhi. She joined journalism after college and was a reporter between 1983 and 1993. In that time, she covered various kinds of communal violence and realized that there was a deeper current in our society that mainstream media could not cover. She formed Communalism Combat in 1993 with her partner Javed Anand, with the aim of fighting communalism from all communities. They wrote about the horror of what the Taliban was doing in Afghanistan, about the plight of Bangladeshi Hindus. They criticized the Jamaat-e-Islami in India. And Trishta herself wrote five important stories on what was unfolding in Gujarat before 2002. She saw society getting increasingly fractured and warned about Gujarat exploding into criminal violence well before it happened. And when the 2002 riots took place, she played a part in helping the victims and in fighting for justice for them. That's a fight we know her for, but she's also fighting for other causes, such as the unseen chaos that's unfolding in Assam over the impending Citizenship Act. She's also a fine scholar who's been teaching young students about history and politics for over two decades. In fact, the thing that struck me most about Trishta was that she is both a thinker and a doer, and the thinking and the doing inform each other. She's had a rich life and has tons of insight to share on our country and our times. I loved her memoir, Foot Soldier of the Constitution, which I recommend all of you buy. And I love this conversation. Note by the way that we didn't discuss a few things that are sub judice, but there is still so much here to marvel at and to learn from. Before we start though, let's take a quick commercial break. Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction. In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing. That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you. Teesta, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Great to be here, Amit. You know, normally, when I'm sitting with a guest, we go a long way back and talk about their childhood and all of that. But with you, I want to go even further back. Because just now at lunch, we were talking about Maharashtra and Gujarat. And you were telling me about how Maharashtra has so many different syncretic traditions. So it's not just the RSS strain of a particular kind of Hindutva, which is relatively recent, like you pointed out, but it goes back centuries. And equally, you mentioned how Gujarat interestingly doesn't despite producing outliers, I guess, like Gandhi and Patel. Can you elaborate a little bit more"

        "message": "on this for me? Yeah, actually, it's a fascinating discussion in itself, because for many of us who look at history and Indian constitution and law, not just in books, but in practice, have found that this subcontinent, you know, the soil, this India, South Asia, has had a very strong strain of resistance, if you like, of questioning of rationality, which goes back like, centuries, centuries, it could even go back to the early Indian period, or even the certainly the early medieval period, early Indian as well. Because if you look at the entire question of Buddha Buddhism, Jainism, Buddhism, then of course, the resurgence of Shankaracharya, trying to bind it all back together for the Sanatan Dharma. Then you look at the early medieval and you have the Bhakti Sufi traditions and you have, you know, across the country, and particularly Western, Central, North India, Bengal, East India, Northeast, this entire business of looking at faith, spirituality, the individual, her or his space in it and questioning and always looking at equality and non-discrimination through it, has been there, has been very much there. I mean, you can name them, you can look at Basavanna in modern day Karnataka, Narayan, Guru, more modern period, you can look at Kabir in Banaras, you know, and we know where Banaras is today, and you look at Guru Nanak, and you look at coming back to your, you know, your, the Western Indian, what I'm talking about, that RSS is a very new thing. I mean, it's a new modern proto-fascist concept. It's, before that we had Eknath, we had Namdev, we had Tukaram, and then we've had Phuleyambedkar. So the argument for some of us is that the inherent values of the Indian Constitution, you know, which formally came to us with the discussions around the Karachi Resolution, which was an Indian National Congress in the 1930s, where Subhash Chandra Bose as president and Gandhi as the mentor, but it was Subhash Chandra Bose, the agricultural struggle, the workers struggle, the left traditions that influenced and pushed the Congress into making the plea for fundamental rights for all, which included workers' rights and women's rights and rights of all genders, etc. Those are not entirely foreign. And anyway, I'm not trying to say that there's anything wrong with internationalism, because we know the modern discourse that came with the French Revolution was also a metamorphosis across continents. But there's a strong strain of our people, particularly people who are lesser privileged in terms of class and caste, questioning the rigidity of caste and of privilege. And Basavanna talked about gender in a very, very strong way. So, you had the Rashtra Seva Dalas worked on Maharashtrian women saints of the Bhakti tradition, single women. And later on, we saw Nargis and Jogin in the middle part of the 20th century, you know, and she was representing that. It's the Miras and the Janabais and all of that, who took to the streets singing to their God and said, we are not going to be living within the family, within patriarchy and within the bonds of marriage or whatever. And you had the Gargi and Jayabala in the Vedic period also saying that we have a right to the Vedic scriptures. So, there has been a strong strain of this. And all of this is also metamorphosed into the constitution as much as modern ideas of equality, fraternity, justice and non-discrimination. Now, between Maharashtra and Gujarat, I found it fascinating because I speak better Marathi than, though Gujarati is my mother tongue, but I speak and read better Marathi because this is my karmabhoomi, if you like, because it's three, four generations we've lived here. But thanks to my paternal grandfather, I can read and speak Gujarati as well. But I've seen that in Maharashtra, with all the rigidity of a kind of Brahmanism and conservatism, which is evident in certain traditions, you've always had this subaltern questioning and that has manifested itself, manifests itself in reform. It manifests itself in something fascinating because I teach history in schools and I try to go by what Fred said, that the classroom should be the, should be the location for questioning and not for a one-way traffic between what you're told to be taught and what you're told to be learned. He said in 1848, Savitri Bai Phule and her partner opens the first all-girls school, possibly in the world, possibly in the world. And what is the, what is the concept that in one class, you like girls of different castes and communities studying together. Now, this is before you have the civil rights movement in the US and the anti-segregation civil rights movement where black girls could also come into the classroom. So, what does this mean? It means that there's a huge churning and an assertion and that I think still survives in Maharashtra with all its other regressive tendencies. Gujarat has been different and because of my work as first as a journalist, then as an activist in Gujarat, I've always asked that what is this difference? Is it because there was no strong anti-caste movement like you see in many other parts of the country, particularly in Maharashtra? Of course, you had Narmad and his poetry apart from Gandhi and Patel. Of course, you had Wali Gujarati, one of our, Wali Dakhani, one of our early Urdu poets coming and settling in Ahmedabad and calling Gujarati his own land. It was his tomb that was dug open on 28th of February 2002. But there's a mercantilism which runs across communities. There is a sort of prosaic non-questioning that is prevalent, you know, so that has affected things there. And therefore, I think for the project for the Hindu Rashtra and the project for the masochist authoritarian state to revile and to discredit Gandhi in the land of his birth, Porbandar, Gujarat was very, very important, has been very important."

        "message": "So a couple of strands I want to sort of follow up on. And the first is this that if we look back through the centuries, if we look at that tradition of questioning existing structures and so on and so forth, I would imagine that for most of our history, those would not be against the state because the state would be a very distant kind of thing. It would more be against power structures in society around you where you see caste play itself out, or you see gender play itself out, and so on and so forth. And this sense of this strong authoritarian state, which is like a distant beast, somewhere far away, how do you even rebel, blah, blah, blah, seems to be a relatively recent phenomenon, if we talk in terms of centuries. Has that dimmed the fire somewhat? Because just kind of looking back through the decades of our independence, one strand that kind of stands out is just one of apathy, one of inertia that you let things happen, you know, people almost become fatalistic. Now, it's possible that people were always fatalistic. And, you know, it's a bit of selection bias that we remember all the rebels and all the countercultures and everything, and that those exist today as well. But is it that it just seems harder to fight the distant state, which you know, you can't beat anyway. So, you know, you just get on with things."

        "message": "You know, I think it also depends on what history we read, and which struggles we pick and which icons we remember. I've been fortunate through the work I've chosen to do, which has not become a ninth generation, high profile lawyer that I could have been because given the settler tradition, I could have been the ninth and you know, apart from maybe being good at my job, I could have earned all sorts of money, but that's not the issue. The point is, one chose a path of, it's not about activism, it's about interrogating power structures at various levels. So, apart from the work I'm more known for, which is human rights and fighting for justice in the courts, one of my passions is education and pedagogy of history teaching, and social science teaching in the classroom. And for that, we had this coach project, which we kind of undertake, and we are doing it in municipal schools and private schools in different parts of the country. Now, fortunately, one has been able to look at therefore, history and turn it on its head. And if I, answering your question, if I ask you that then what made the Adivasis and the agriculturalists be the first challengers to colonial rule, before anybody from the cities got up and found out even before Dadabhai Naoroji's historic pamphlet on poverty? I think, because they experienced firsthand what colonialism and to what extent colonial power economically and culturally debauched them, you know, which is not to say earlier oligarchies, coming to your question earlier oligarchies or monarchs had an equitable relationship with them. No, there was a feudal relationship, they would take their share, but they left the lands alone. Okay, they left the lands largely alone, there was a transactional relationship, which was, of course, iniquitous, but what colonialism did was completely ravaged our land, our population and our people. If you look at Indigo, Indigo rebellion, the Santal rebellion, I mean, I mean, I've been fortunate enough to work with Adivasi, All India Union of Forest Working People for the last nine years and I have seen firsthand those struggles and how they've kept their oral histories alive and that has opened my eyes to the fact that we've really not looked at urban India and upper caste, upper class India, liberal India has not looked at these subaltern histories which have been manifest in challenging colonialism. I mean, that is why the land law was passed in 1848, that is why the forest act was passed in 1927 because the British had to clamp down on these struggles and if you look at the way the lawyers and the doctors and the names you and I know or we knew in childhood started fighting for freedom and all of them are very admirable, that happened like 150 years later, but these struggles had already been born and were being challenged and they lost lives at huge cost, you know, there's Birsa Munda, there's named from Assam to Maharashtra to Karnataka and these are modern-day constructs, but to Bengal huge, Tibhaga struggle to Telangana, modern-day Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, you had the agriculturalists and the Adivasis challenging colonial powers like nobody else did, you know. So, I think that is a very important thing to remember in terms of answering your question. I think a point will come when I think even with this fractured values that neoliberalism has caused us where all of us are in little aspirational bubbles and it's not easy to collectively organize or unionize or protest anymore, traditionally protest anymore. I think a time will come and I just hope that human cost is not too high by then when people will just find what's happening is too much, just too much, even though the state is, it's not distant ever. The state is never distant. In fact, today the state appears very oppressive and very intrusive just like the colonial state was and I think what we are experiencing today is a kind of neo-colonialism really because if you look at the corporatization on the one hand and the snatching away of civil rights on the other and of course minority rights being right out there first, that's what we are seeing. So, and constitutionalism and what the freedom struggle fought for is being turned on its head. So, Ambedkar becomes an icon for the regime and yet the collected works of Ambedkar, 18 volumes are sold without the six critical volumes at the Delhi Book Fair which is the most and which are those caste and minorities, sorry state and minorities, annihilation of caste, riddles in Hinduism, the most critical books of Ambedkar when it comes to the Hindu religious and social structure are not part of the official volume sold by the government of India anymore. So, you are picking and choosing, you can't ignore Ambedkar, you can't ignore Bhagat Singh, you can't ignore Subhash Chandra Bose. So, you pick and choose and you appropriate them and you try and hollow them out. The essence of these people was what they stood for. I mean Bhagat Singh's writing on the dangers of communalism of all kinds, Ambedkar's writing on not just the caste question but also on communalism and the state majoritarian project and why even I feel like really looking at Gandhi's stand on the communal award and the communal electorate because I think Ambedkar was right in saying that reserved constituencies should allow that section to vote for that section because otherwise you won't have representation of Dalits and minorities in Parliament and we are seeing that. So, so many issues get thrown up and I think a time will come when I think the apathy will be overcome by the sheer intrusion of the horror that the state is undertaking at the moment."

        "message": "So, number of strands to go down on but it's interesting you should mention about how people are trying to appropriate Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh and so on because we are recording this on October 27th and just yesterday there was this announcement of you know Arvind Kejriwal saying we must have Laxmi and Madhurga on the currency notes because our economy will do well and on the background there were these photographs of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh and you know I mean what would those men have made of something like this and when I meant a distant state I didn't mean a distant as in it doesn't affect our lives. Of course it does. It's distant in terms of accountability, seeming accountability but its tentacles are all over us. I refer to our state as a predatory state. I'm fascinated by what you said earlier because you're right that you know what we make of history sometimes depends on how we've studied it and what prism we are looking at it from and what you mentioned about the first sort of pushback against colonialism coming from Adivazis and agriculturalists is not something I've really read much about. So, why don't you you know give me a little potted"

So, we've done a chapter for this book that is a part of a foreign university publication and we also brought out a booklet for the union and CJP and I think it's very important to look at this because it tells us four or five things it tells us first of all that coming back to your question that this history is very important history of struggle because the history of struggle is the history of actually obtaining your rights and that's always a fundamental for any civil liberties activists which I primarily am that no rights have come for easy no rights have come for free okay they don't come unless you there's a struggle for them worldwide we've seen that from Africa to the United States to any part of the world I mean even now I mean if you look at the United States there's still barely a recognition of what they've done to their own American Indian people and that conversation is beginning to happen in Australia to some extent with the with the indigenous and the Maori populations and all and it's a painful conversation because it's not easy but I think all of us particularly from the privileged sections need to have that because we we don't realize to what extent that appropriation of resources has happened by those of us who have come from from privileged sections so coming back to this you know during the COVID period in fact which was otherwise a very difficult period because none of us could travel as much we normally do and particularly going to some areas we undertook this exercise of ensuring that all of us in the I'm not that citizen for justice and peace the organization which I represent and also the other one of which I'm vice president which is the Akhil Bharatiya Vanjan Shamjivi Union that the in all the units of the unions we should stay connected and CJP helped helped helped hugely in this because we said that you know technology is such a faraway thing and technology in the village and the Gram Sabha how do you do it so we sort of did these zoom trainings and the zoom workshops I mean connectivity India is very we think we are greatly committed very very poor if you look at the non-urban areas so all of those were huge challenges we tried to overcome them and we started having weekly meetings if what eventually became Gram Sabha meetings on zoom I mean I cannot even tell you what that experience was because I could be sitting in Bombay or Pune or Delhi wherever I was in that one camera that was in Sonbhadra in UP where Sukala was the president of our union she's the most amazing woman she's been jailed twice in her lifetime and unlike me when she was in jail for a month she didn't eat food she just survived on fruit and milk I don't know how she did that so she would be sitting on her camera on a phone phone camera with at least 150 women in the same room and each one would have their turn to speak on the zoom and all of us would be able to listen so it was amazingly humbling and democratizing process and through that we decided collectively that knowledge about the constitution and Adivasi rights and the making of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 which is our mantra for the Adivasi and indigenous movement because it's the law that came about because of these collective struggles in the land and forest because it turns the whole notion of elite conservation on its head that you can't really conserve environment without protecting the rights of the people who've lived in those environs you know and because they are the best conservers of that it's not a hostile positioning it has to be a collaborative thing so when this started to happen you realize that they were also during the COVID period commemorating their histories all the time so they were saying we will start our own kind of schools which will be shifting schools which will be telling our own histories and the histories of these struggles are alive to them we think that you know we have to dig them up from the odd historian who actually has had the grace to look at Adivasi struggles in English or Bengali and the Bengali translation or Hindi translation and there have been some amazing bureaucrats also from the IS and earlier from the British colonial period who documented some of these despite being part of a colonial hierarchy and you collect this information and then you know these struggles are being actually today celebrated commemorated as well they haven't forgotten them but then you give it a discussion gives it a deeper form and a context you connect it up with today's struggles and through those exercises that one and a half two year period and through that we saw the farmers struggle okay and I want to mention this because it was an amazing thing what what happened to India during that pandemic particularly the second half I mean you saw that from June of 2020 and then you saw November 2020 and you saw how that I mean where was the pandemic for those for the farmers who went and sat at outside Delhi you know and I mean they compelled and impelled all of us to to look at their struggle and they brought history and context to their struggle because everything they were saying particularly the BKU Ugran and all they were talking about Bhagat Singh's grandfather and Punjab and you know what what the what the impoverishment of colonial rule meant and how our policies are taking us back in that direction by not by passing laws that are going to corporatize agriculture completely and leave the bargaining power of the farmer out of the question so you know all these things are very very crucial so I think for me it has been a learning through actually working with people's struggles and having the humility to always understand that you don't know it all in fact you're in a constant process or yes you bring something of your experience and learning to the process and that's why it's collaborative and important but there's so much you need to learn actually from people's struggle and you know like we were talking earlier that we are a strongly oral history tradition you know and if you remember the Pathalkadi movement you know which father Stan and others when father Stan died in judicial tragically died in I mean to the judicial murder but that Pathalkadi's struggle was doing just this in in Tharkhand you know what were they saying they were saying that we will on stones and on pillars put up our constitutional rights which have been granted to us so whether it is schedule nine or schedule five or the constitution or whether it is article the directive principles which give Adivasi rights or whether it is a Niyam Giri judgment or any of the judgments that the court has given us we will put that down so tomorrow when the forest official comes and pretends not to know of these laws which have been passed by the Indian Parliament we'll say we'll tell you we'll do a legal education for you you know and there is this very strong belief that the constitution is ours among people of this country that the laws the progressive laws passed the recognition of land rights recognition of forest rights the land acquisition law which was amended and by the UPA to government before the present regime overturned it again all of these were not because the UPA to government wanted to give it it was because there was being a coalition government being not a authoritarian strong government they were compelled to listen to voices from the ground and that's what a democracy is so I think coming back to your question of history and Adivasi history it all boils down to working with communities on an equitable basis equal basis and realizing that any struggle that you're involved in today has to hark back to your past because eventually you are based on your symbolisms your I mean the strong women's presence in Adivasi struggles has been there from the beginning the very strong women's presence number of women lost to the battle against communal colonialism has been huge they know the names they know the name they sing songs to them they know that they advocated education for the kids they educated the rights over forest produce and that it should not that should not go to the colonial powers and the forest bureaucracy but unfortunately there's always been this distance between urban and rural and Adivasi and non-Adivasi and hence it's taken a while for the rest of us to open our eyes to it."

Panikkar and I'm talking about the 80s 80s and 90s when we used to hold workshops with them first to learn and then I organized workshops with them for teachers and you've got a great interview of Romila ji also I'll link that from the show notes for me the most I mean and for them I organized three workshops where they came and actually interacted with the school teachers from about maybe 40 schools in Bombay two schools each and three four days they interacted and so and my thought behind that because Khoj the pedagogy of Khoj was evolving at that stage now we've got about 54 modules going and resources permitting we can do that or we can't do that kind of workshop all the time but we are editing it and we're trying to make it available so we can use that input idea being that the those original thinkers and historians who are actually looking at history in a particular way should interact directly with the carriers of that history into the classroom so that that pedagogy of a non-didactic teaching not no final full stop always a question mark have the humility and courage to say you don't know something and you look it up and come back and the child will respect you more the young mind will respect you more not less all of that went into this exercise so I remember those kind of early days when I was also sort of learning all this and I'm still learning is that they would say that you know and that's when Narcissus of course it's going to be 100 years old in 1925 into 2025 so it's worked very hard for what it's done apart from acting having obnoxious amounts of money which it shouldn't have but that's not the point that one of the bulwarks against authoritarian supremacism is local histories and diversity and pluralism okay this was always what we said and came up with at the end of these discussions and workshops that and we need to do this at various levels we need to do it as at the at the finer academic historical level where there's a certain rigor of the discipline where local histories emerge and maybe even contradict the national narrative doesn't matter let the let the dialectic emerge but we also need to do the level of people and communities which is the question you are asking so I think it's very important and this continues to be a passion for some of us you know and we are also doing so many things that it doesn't always happen the way we want it to happen but but wherever I go wherever I speak into workshops speak about civil rights liberties I keep trying to say that put together a group of citizens whether it's Belgaum whether it is Mangalore whether it is Chiplun a tiny seaside town in Maharashtra put together you'll always have those 10-15 people 5 people 4 people who are obsessed with your past and your history and your tradition put them together meet regularly start documenting and put it out you know because I think that is our only bulwark against this this top-down homogenization which has a sinister political motive without question I think this is what we've tried to bring into the coach classroom and if you give me a few minutes I want to share this because it was fascinating for us when we evolved these modules and one of the modules is which we do I mean unfortunately because they're dealing with India school structure and the classroom and we don't make it a honeymoon experiment with those special schools we've we've decided to look at the school as it is for everybody you know which is a problem but we have to tackle it so we've tried to do it in middle school like 5th 6th 7th a three-year program not not necessarily go 8th and 9th only special classes because the whole exam pressure gets too much etc so towards the end between the 6th and 7th we do this migratory history model you know which is my history the child's history the idea is to introduce to the young mind which is about 10 11 12 by then 11 12 by then that let's explore your family history each each each one of you need to explore your history and how do you we don't finish it in one class ever it goes through three or four sessions once a week maybe you come back to it even a month later two months later idea is ask questions in your family and in your community where are we from which village which district which state which language do we speak do we have connections with that with that place still do we go back if not where did we directly come from there to Mumbai or Pune wherever the class is being held or did we go somewhere in between and start chasing this start chasing it make notes jot it down if you ask enough questions you'll find a couple of people who are willing to kind of wax eloquent about this once you get them to wax eloquent cross check the sources a little bit cross check with two three people the facts and all that and start penning this history migratory history of say Dhruv Prajapati or whatever the name is and start writing it down and then at the end of nine months one and a half years whenever it's ready when these are sort of shared in a live classroom atmosphere I cannot begin to even describe to you what happens in the classroom because the entire temperature changes the classroom sort of almost becomes from a kind of a uniform straight in a line benches it suddenly becomes multicolored colorful somebody brings in a Kannada word somebody brings in a Telugu word Tulu word Urdu couplet a funny story a tragic story and the diversity is really lived and felt because that's how all our realities are whether Mumbai might be more than that some cities might be less but I show me one one one classroom any part of India or the world where this diversity does not exist we are all we are all migrated from somewhere to somewhere we are all creatures of movement and travel that's what human beings are and maybe some are not but even that is very interesting so I think that whole concept that you understand each other through the story through the language through the past through the present is very important for the young mind to develop and if you do that I feel and that's been one of our reasons why we are doing COGE even now after 20 32 years is that it's a very small thing it it it'll take a long time but but but the young minds who go through it never give up that questioning and I don't believe in this business of teaching secularism or teaching the Constitution you can't do what you can do is if you want to share an understanding of article 14 and 15 which is equality and non-discrimination then you have to teach them about discrimination share stories about discrimination and struggles against discrimination so that's the only be a sense of what that article is will actually take root in that young mind and then you at the end of 13 years might get a citizen that is a questioning citizen and not just somebody who's looking for job and pay hikes so I think that has been the that has been the basis of this whole thing when we look at homogenization when we look at authoritarianism it's all connected why is there this obsession whether you look at the fundamentalism of political Islam or whether you look at Hindutva or if you look at extremely rigid Buddhism that Sri Lanka also threw up when it massacred so many Tamils and not Sri Lanka why is this obsession with homogenizing and uniformity it's as if it's as if diversity itself is a threat and therefore the patriarchy comes in the rigidity comes in the attacks on women come in all of this so I think the ability to connect some of all of these things is very very important and can we do that can we do that in our struggles can we form alliances in our struggles this has been an abiding concern and question and I don't think we've always succeeded but I think the effort itself is very important effort itself is very important because you're able to see that not just this struggle which you've taken up just now is important of course it is but there are also many other myriad struggles that need to be looked at to be able to question this absolutely crude homogenization that we are seeing."

        "message": "I find this story you've told of the magic you created in the classroom very resonant because it feeds in with a theme that I think about a fair bit which is the importance of the concrete in our lives like what often happens is that if we just think in terms of abstractions like nationalism or purity or race or the other or Hindu or Muslim those abstractions can be dangerous and can lead us down you know problematic paths but the moment you make it concrete and I see that's what's happening in this classroom that's what it seems like to me that it's almost like a show don't tell brought to life that each child is making herself concrete by talking about her past and where she's come from and you know showing her authentic self also in a sense and showing the joy and that and everyone can then relate to each other in a different way it's a lesson about discrimination in the most beautiful way because it's a lesson about the joy of diversity which is automatically an anti-discriminatory lesson right so that that's a lovely story here's my next a digressive question and obviously that cliche is of course true whatever you say about India the opposite is also true right so we are deeply illiberal in so many ways gender caste whatever but there is a lived liberalism which you can you know see in our languages in our cuisine and our clothes assimilations from everywhere and you've also spoke at the start of this conversation about how Maharashtra has had much older traditions in the RSS which go back which are syncretic tolerant which celebrate you know differences but here's the thing my sense and we were chatting about this at lunch and it's a theme I keep going back to is that if there is one way in which I have realized I was wrong about the world it is that you know growing up in my little elite English-speaking bubble I always thought that you know India is broadly tolerant we are liberal there are fringes but that's okay you know we are what we are and my sense and I can perhaps get too pessimistic about this is that no that you know we are the bubble and society is always been extremely illiberal and these strands that we see in political Hindutva today they're not recent they've been like I did an episode with Akshay Mukul on the Gita Press and all fantastic book and all of these issues from you know love jihad and cow protection and conversions all of these were live issues exactly a hundred years ago as well right and if you see sort of the sales of the books on the Gita Press including their manuals telling women how to behave and innocent in sanskari ways and so on and so forth you realize that this is a very big in our society and therefore one begins to wonder about whether the experiment that we tried with the kind of constitution that we had was it bound to fail because what we seem to have done is we took a liberal constitution not as liberal as I would like but still much more liberal than society and imposed it on an illiberal society and assumed that the job was over that we are doing it top-down things will take care of themselves you know Madhav Khosla in a brilliant book an episode with me describes a constitution as a pedagogic exercise and it seems that politics has caught up with society and therefore where again I'd look pessimistically at what you said about at some point something's going to give at some you know I don't know if at some point something's going to give because the majority is having its way now who's going to do the rebelling it's not that society is being forced into a direction against its will or whatever you know this horrible direction that we are going in seems to be if the majority aren't actively clamoring for it they are perfectly content with it which is you know obviously it's a very pessimistic view and I know you're not so pessimistic so I mean what's what's your sense of this am I being too negative"

        "message": "no I just it's it's a it's a kind of expected question and it's a question that is that needs to be asked if you like but I just would like to take a little bit of issue with say the proposition that Madhav would make or whatever because I think it shows very little regard for what went into the making of the constitution I mean to think that the constitution or the constituent assembly debates that resulted in the constitution and to forget that the constituent assembly debates had the partition bang in the middle of it and the fact that the constitution actually emerged after the 150 175 years of the struggle against the British I think it really disregards the entire sacrifices or the pains of the national movement against British colonialism so I just like to contest that very strongly because I think to say that it was a pedagogic constitution is actually to disregard that the what I said right in the beginning that the values that were thrown up from the freedom struggle from the national movement also harked back to much earlier struggles but they coalesced in a certain way and they represented a large and vast section of our people in fact I think the problem is with liberals who think that we are the cocooned minority but I think the vast vast vast section of these people of the people of this country have actually battled inequality and oppression of various kinds under British rule and they actually were part of the movement against the British so I want to repeat that and I think therefore the values that were then sort of nichodoed and put into the constitution came as much from there as much as from the higher intellect as we like to think of it of people I mean why was Babasaheb Ambedkar chosen I mean that question I think Madhav Goswami should also answer because why was Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar a man a young man who when he was a young boy of maybe 12 or 13 in the Elphinstone school Mumbai sitting in a classroom and a brilliant mind and a maths problem is put to him and nobody in the class is able to answer and he puts his hand up confidently and then the teacher is compelled to allow him to come up to the blackboard to write down the five steps solution to the maths problem which he does he solves it correctly and the attention of the class by the time he's reached the last the answer is not on the fact that he's got it correct but the fact that a quote-unquote untouchable has reached the blackboard because all their tiffin boxes are behind and therefore they will not eat their food anymore because now it has been polluted now this is the man chosen quote-unquote not chosen he's the man who obviously the person to write the constitution and how can we therefore ever say that the majority of this country are sworn to a kind of a majoritarian authoritarian deal no I think there is a certainly the subaltern there's a whole section of the underbelly and that has grown from the meagre 0.5 or 10 percent of the Jan Sangh once had to maybe even a 30 percent or 35 percent or 40 percent of the population but I do not think that I will accept that it is a hundred percent what has happened for sure is that the rest whether it is 20% or 60% we can argue numbers but I think they have been silenced at various levels particularly the ones who are in a position to speak one is a kind of a sense of self-preservation and fear that we would not like to be the next persons who are a target whether it be through state agencies or through any sort of vilification and there's a larger section our problem is the Indian middle class which is just too obnoxiously large by world standards which actually does not care one way or the other it does not care either whether we are going to be a democratic constitutional state or an authoritarian state because it's navigating its life but they are not the majority of the population they are obnoxiously large but they are not the majority of the population so I think it's the fragmentation and the silencing which is not letting the rest sort of come together in a way that would give hope to everybody that something is happening if you are looking and working at the grassroots if you are looking at the kind of the struggles in various parts of the country and there are myriads of them I think one will realize that it's not an entirely hope it is fairly hopeless but not entirely I'm not a stupid optimist but I'd also like to say that the hugest and biggest abdication of the last decade and a half has been by the media and I think all of us in some way or the other are products and have been associated with the media so I think we need to understand what this means you know and I remember when I did these long interviews with Sainath who's really interrogated this thing very very deeply and of course there are many others that when you know he said it's not it's a kind of a triangle hold on Indian democracy now through the corporatization of the media and the politicization party politicization I mean media has to be political but you have if one party dominates the ownership of the media and corporates and those same people are then now the dominant in Parliament so then when he calculates like Sainath does that how many percentage of our parliamentarians are billionaires and which industries do they represent then it's mining telecom and television companies so then you know that the digital communications industry your commercial television and your political representation is all the same and therefore you're unlikely to see a debate happening there on what you were talking about which is a homogenized banana or the rice varieties which are being completely finished off because of the kind of priorities we are giving to agriculture forget a lynching or a Mohammed Clark you won't even have a debate on homogenization of agriculture because it's not in the interest of you know the section that would benefit from this homogenization who are sitting in Parliament to do that so actually therefore we are talking about as in when and if the resistance happens in our lifetime and I hope it does even if it doesn't seem very imminent is that you really need to be looking at electoral reform judicial reform media ownership changes you know so you need to look we need to look at judicial reform court and you need to look at so many things being turned on their head which is like individual and collective struggles that encompass all of this and is that feasible is that happening can it happen is of course seems so overwhelming that we most of the time feel it cannot happen I mean just look at what the election commission is doing look at the electoral bonds issue I mean it's so brazenly non-transparent it is brazenly non-transparent you know and then therefore there's inordinate hope that is required from the judiciary and will the supreme court cope therefore these debates on who the next chief justice is going to be so all of this is we are looking at these one two three places for us to get manners from heaven and to get solutions from them all of this can only happen if there are these myriad struggles that are constantly pushing these institutions to answer and many more people who are willing from the political opposition to not say Lakshmi and Ganesh on the vote but to actually say we are prepared to go to jail and let's flood our jails with the opposition doesn't matter if you want to do it but we are going to raise some inconvenient questions we are going to raise questions of the lynching of minorities the lynching of Dalits the attacks on girls in Uttar Pradesh we are going to raise these issues even if it's inconvenient so there is a sense of despair because of the quiet we see but I think we need to start looking for constructive noise"

        "message": "and constructive struggles so we will talk about each of these one by one as we go along in the conversation but first there is a book by Rohit Dey called the People's Constitution which makes exactly that point that these are not just imported values these are lived values and they reflect in people's struggles in different ways let me ask you sort of my final digressive question before we get back to our chronological narrative of your growing up and your family and all of that and this one nicely segues into that because you know you said a little earlier that you were almost sort of the ninth lawyer in the family down the family line and all of that and it would seem to me that in one way you are doing exactly the same thing or working in exactly the same spirit as your grandfather and as his father before him in the sense that they were using their skills to work for a better society in the role that most made sense to them at the time right so flush after independence for example your granddad M.C. Settlebarth first attorney general it would have seemed that yeah I know the law this is independent India needs people like me and that is what an idealist would do and we find over time that that idealism and that hope in the in the virtues of the state have kind of vanished that we are faced with a much starker reality and it might and and you would obviously you don't know whether it's true or not but I imagine if your grandfather was born when you were he might have gone down on the kind of line that you did because you can't anymore make a better society in that way from within the system because it'll just corrode you and it'll eat you up and in a sense if you you know want to go down those paths you end up like your root in that sense feels natural like on one hand and and and that's you know a separate side question that how do we become what we become how much of it is contingent and how much of it is has something to do with our essential nature and on the one hand it might seem contingent different things happen you know your first journalism job you're covering those riots you're covering criminal violence on one hand it might seem contingent but on the other hand in these times what else could you have been is another question that comes to my mind yeah actually"

        "message": "that's interesting this I was just rereading my grandfather's autobiography my life law and other things and there's a very interesting chapter in it on the Mundra scandal which was the independent India's first huge financial scam and scandal and he was Attorney General at the time and the fact that and the whole question of autonomy of autonomy of opposition if I look at today with the Attorney General I mean today we have a very decent Attorney General after many years but look at how the Solicitor General is functioning today it's so crude you know apart from anything and so it tells you a little bit about how these institutions need to function because he narrates it was the Chagla MC Chagla the Doan was appointed as Commissioner into the scandal and he was representing the government government as in state not in government in power so he and he had made that very clear and the entire proceedings were in our city which is the old town hall where now the Director General of Police sits and it was hugely attended by the public Chagla had taken the decision that it'll be open and of course Settelbad was arguing and that all these evidence was coming etc and the very interesting passages from there because obviously the dispensation and that was our first Prime Minister highly regarded and it was about the LIC scam LIC investing out of turn more than a crore of its capital on in private enterprise when it should could not have done that without under the act under which it was formed and without consulting its shareholders which is the public so anyway so of course the stand that my grandfather took and then the praise he got from the newspapers and all of that and obviously dispensation was not happy and including the Prime Minister was not very happy with the kind of independence stand he took yet after the whole thing got over and the T Krishnamachari was compelled to resign after the Finance Minister so it was like a huge thing internationally as well he described the first visit to the prior Nehru's residence after dinner because there were a lot of rumors that now Settelbad will resign because he was Attorney General for about 12 years because the government is unhappy with him and I think Nehru went out of his way apart from anything else to say that that is not what he intended at all though he was upset at the time so it's both things you see you see the fact that yes there was this tension and the tension was unfortunate and should not have happened that you saw the Finance Secretary and the Home and the Finance Minister and the State Bank Chairperson and the RBI Chairperson behaving in ways they shouldn't have but you equally saw the Attorney General and MC Chagla and others functioning above I mean beyond par you know and then he writes there that then you know after that he talks about his father Sir Chimanlal Settelbad who my great-grandfather went because he cross examined Dyer in the Hunter Commission and because of it that but for me it was so important also to see about Chimanlal and this I'm hoping that his autobiography we are reprinting now my as well because if people demanded but it's out of print is that he was a close colleague of Babasaheb Ambedkar and in 1924 Chimanlal was president of what is called the Bahishket Hithkarni Sabha which was formed with the aim of ensuring the construction of 124 hostels for Dalit girls and boys because the whole understanding being that you know they're left out they can't stay there because only residential colleges are possible so we must have this and it's not just Chimanlal the entire trust the board of that was one Parsi one Jew so different castes and communities recognizing the vision of Ambedkar of course this is the tradition one has grown up very proudly with and knew about this but I was very personally it was sort of assumed that I would be the one we are just two sisters I would be the one who does law because my sister was not particularly interested I was always very interested in the law and current affairs and everything but I mean 12th standard changed all that 7th standard changed all that when I was about 12 years old when I just a book that my father bought me actually all the precedence men and I said no I just have to do journalism and I told him that one day in one of our myriad discussions and arguments that I want to now do journalism I remember he didn't say a word he didn't even say that there was no pressure no pressure at all he just sort of kept quiet for a few minutes and then he said you have to do what you are most happy doing and I think that feeling of being brought up in that sort of environment where you had a father who asked him to call him by his first name he never asked us to call him father or papa or daddy or whatever we always called him Atul both of us and he was very comfortable with two girl children I think my mother probably wanted a son but because there were two miscarriages after my younger sister but I don't think he was at all at all concerned that he didn't have a son I think this also gets allows a lot of self-confidence to grow so then you not only decide to take on a profession which is not this thing but you also ask questions of your father who's told you once that don't study your kundra and your history textbook read the history from your library that you're lucky enough to have because he had a huge personal library of history and stuff then I would ask him but why do you have more Nehru and Gandhi and Patel and why don't you have Avinash Ambedkar and Phule moment I was in junior college so all that questioning and turning would begin your political my own politicization in in Elphinstone College which again I chose because my father and grandfather and had gone to that college so there was this thing of always being proud of that tradition but also also being quite self-assured about questioning it and taking a different path and I think that is also probably comes from that upbringing upbringing but of course you're also your own person so even as a reporter I covered the courts immediately after doing my university beat and political beat I was very keen on legal reportage and coverage legal analysis of judgments so I think there was the attraction of the law and understanding it or try to deconstruct it didn't ever go away though of course one was looking at it from a different prism than a practicing lawyer you know and but I still will see and maybe then you want to ask you something more is that I still have had the good fortune of it through my work coming across a wide spectrum of lawyers who are existing in today's much more difficult system than it would have been for my grandfather or my father and great grandfather also that and we're doing such a fine dignified job of it you know and it must be so much harder because we are facing a very viciously reprisal oriented government and yet they they just carry on at great personal risk and displaying huge moral courage so yeah maybe that's the trajectory I took but I'm so glad that there are lawyers within in in our courts whether it is Gujarat High Court whether it is Bombay High Court whether it is Delhi Supreme Court who are still there to be able to take up the causes that we all"

once you're in the midst of it even if I were to allow myself to think what is the point like you said or should I give up is that is that is that an option at all because you're not representing only yourself you're not representing only an individual maverick attempt it is part of a collective process that has metamorphosed into something okay so can you just give it up even if you even if you feel more you're a more real person now you're more grounded than when you began in terms of the experience of the system you're more cynical even can you afford to give up that that's one question I'm placing on the table secondly I think you also realize that there are different ways you can take the same struggle forward okay which is that yes even if you look at certain aspects of say targeted killings and communal violence and the accountability we demanded from the state through a battle in the courts which was very rigorously fought and unfortunately was not echoed by a political battle by the opposition of the same kind because that that's also what I say in my book that when when the battle against proto-fascism gets limited to a battle in the courts there is no way you're going to win it okay so that that is also a story which needs to be that's also a strand that needs to be explored in our conversation that why is the political opposition so wary about looking at some of these tumultuous issues as part of election campaign hearing till that happens till we met can that ever happen till we metamorphose into that South Africa did happen many many countries we've seen those language of electoral politics take the language of a of an emancipatory struggle whether it is a question of rights of Adivasis or the rights of minorities or targeted killings that's not happened in our country yet even right to education does not figure as an election manifest to battle so the issue is not just about these are settled word in the courts or whatever it is about the issue the issue is okay you're trying to demand accountability and transparency in heinous targeted killings based on hate speech and hate violence through the courts courts have a certain conservative structure they're not diverse they're not accountable they're appointed we all know that they're top-heavy they take too long all of that can the battle ever be one only there yet if you look at what happened in Gujarat 2002 even now with all the setbacks the kind of convictions we got has unprecedented compared to 84, 92, 93, Meerut, Maliana what I'm trying to say is that and the question you earlier raised which we didn't fully I didn't fully answer is that you know the post independence what this what was expected of the state and what was expected of society I think the state did some of it but not enough what this you mentioned about Nehru did the decent thing he did a decent thing that one time about Mundrabad if you read Nehru and the anonymous column he used to write in the statesman he said that I'm becoming more and more dictatorial because there's nobody to question me in my cabinet and he then the way he proceeded and you see a certain degeneration and you see whether whether it is inducting family or whatever it is and the disrespect for federalism and I think that is the important thing about the constitution which again has not been understood that it's a unity but federal structure and we are seeing this noise is coming from the south we are seeing DMK make that noise in a very considered way we are seeing the Kerala make that noise now whether it'll be effective or not but it's a battle it's and eventually we are 75, 76 years down look at other democracies and how they've evolved is democracy the best way even history will tell us that but but it has taken 200, 150 years for capitalist entrenched democracies to even get their quote-unquote institutions to a level at which when Trump is trying to capture that election which one and a half years back you have election officers many of them women saying no the last vote will be counted you know which given America's foreign policy is no great deal because they massacred people all over the world but at least as far as that institution is concerned it gave me a lot of hope you know so I'm just saying that it's a very complex battle that we are fighting it's a battle to deepen the institutions of governance of democracy in this country to yet our structure of our society and state is very very casteist classist and feudal or we did not allow the structures of state to get you know to have representation as they ought to have had from the sections that needed the most and deserve it the most in terms of if lived democracy had to come in anytime any Dalit intellectual talks about and the issue of Dalit representation in the higher judiciary they're shot down but it's a very valid question Dalit representation gender representation minority representation why can't we raise it because it's a fact that it's only when those representations come that you will have a sense of your responding and I don't think it's about just identity politics it should be about workers about farmers do we have farmers as judges workers as judges teachers as judges you know it's all of these kind of cross intersectionalities that we need to think so I know I've gone all over the place but what I'm trying to say is that the battle for accountability and transparency the battle for from the state certainly can be more successful in the courts if the courts are more accountable and I'm not running away from that question but it cannot only be fought there it just cannot only be fought there and when we're looking at communal violence or targeted violence against sections of ethnic populations caste or community it is a kind of a I mean it's a historical reprisal as the section sees it for what happened in partition and and that also shows a lack of understanding of history because in partition itself if you look at the map of India and I'm sure you if you taught history you do the same thing I'll teach history that way that you know you look at it from the east to the west and if you look at the trajectory that maybe in Bengal you had no Akali and Hindus were massacred most but in Bihar it was large sections of the Muslims and in Punjab it was the Sikhs so it is everybody it is it's three communities doing it to each other pretty much playing it out and that demon of communal politics that actually sits within all communities and which at one stage you're a majority another stage you're a minority is what we need to tackle that that's the hate politics that we need to tackle and there's a danger of it becoming majoritarianism when it's Hindu were here but equally Islamization in Pakistan or the Buddhist state in Sri Lanka so that understanding we need to get among our people which means a strain of rationality and a strain of questioning and the right wing the supremacist right wing is better organized it's it has had its gold in fact it made it clear when it assassinated Gandhiji and that was in fact my the first book I edited I don't know if you've seen it it's called beyond doubt because I mean for me it was an eye-opener when Jagan Farnes's book I read in Marathi in 1998 where I first as a student of history first his book was called Mahatmanji Akher and he first wrote and it was his original work that there were five attempts on Gandhi before before the last one that successfully killed him and this is not part of the dominant narrative even now I have to keep telling people that did you know that there were six attempts totally with a six was successful and in three previous attempts Godse was part of it so it was not a spontaneous act it was pretty organized pretty well thought out and all of it so I just feel it's all of this coming together let's look at the world the world is also going very right has gone very right so it's not just an Indian phenomenon there's a grappling all along and so much has to do with economic structures and you know the the kind of path of neo-liberalization neo-globalization that the world took which is now being questioned at some level if you look at South America and some of the states there but have we reached a state where we are questioning it I don't think so because if you look at what we are doing with the forest conservation rules what we're looking at the kind of model of development so you know for civil rights activists also like me we have to develop our understanding of economics and what kind of priorities because I'm keen on reaching and discussing with the people who feel today that they are jobless and hopeless and therefore they can sit and watch propaganda videos we need to reach those people because they are the same people who supported Trump you know it's it's the white American workforce that supported Trump and I think if that white American workforce is feeling completely isolated and without job I cannot say that we can't speak to them I cannot say this this is them it's not a them it's a it's a them which is being pulled there because of a certain economic reality you know so it's a huge challenge for all of us who are trying to work at the people's level at the struggle level at mass organization at building up a political opposition we it we all realize also that we have to work with the opposition we've got it's not going to radically change the way we want it to so how do we make that happen how do we work with it you know these are all all very complicated questions and then it boils down to okay what is your struggle and what is your choice and do you stop what you're doing what you're doing and then I think the option is not there to stop maybe you take a break take a different path for a little while but I mean for instance I just wanted to share that apart from the school program the work we're doing in Assam at the moment I don't know if you're aware of it it is looking at the law on citizenship and the way it's rendering millions of Indians genuine Indian citizens a civil death because that's what it is you suddenly wake up and say that you know Amit is not an Indian Tista is not an Indian and then I have to just scramble around putting together documents to prove my citizenship which is not even required under the Indian constitution and we have a team there CJ my organization has been working there since for the last seven years local team diverse gender diverse ethnic diverse working in villages and we're ensuring paralegal and legal aid now according to me that's if that's a that's a follow-up trajectory to what the kind of work we've done before with targeted violence that you're using the law bottom up from the foreigner tribunal level up to the supreme court not just going straight when there's an incident of mass violence but this is an everyday annihilation of the people you know just rendering them completely non-citizens and I think therefore we it's like using your previous expertise in a way where a huge humanitarian crisis is brewing and when I was in jail and I found and this is what I like to just share with your viewers that for a person who has never been looked at herself as an individual but part of a collective battle to feel that the kind of organization building that my CJP has done and that we have now teams working in Assam we have a team working in Purvanchal and we keep telling our supporters that you know these are the teams we need to support it's not a thista or a individual but human rights workers and peace workers on the ground who are able to take up these little and bigger challenges"

        "message": "important question you know I can't tell you how important it is and I'll try and just do some justice to it see I you know it boils down again to this I mean I like the way you put it that is there a lack of imagination I think there is a lack of imagination if I believe as a as a Rahul Gandhi or a Krijiwal or a Mamata or whatever if I believe that this is where society is that this is there's actually everybody has now always been or has become so divided and so polarized that that's the only language I can speak then I will keep perpetuating this lack of imagine but if I actually and I think that's the other problem that if you look at the election figures of number of people who don't vote I think that's a figure that really important to look at it tells a very despairing tale it means a lot of people are just so disillusioned with what's being offered it's not that they're going to this or that they just seem we don't want to vote okay then if you put it together with those who are not voting for this regime I think the figure is pretty large pretty large so I think it's lack of imagination to first say that it's lack of imagination and that lack of imagination is not simply from what the way you put it that go to other issues I think the other issues must be gone too whether it's unemployment or prices and all but I think it's also about tackling diversity and secularism head-on and there I want to hark on something which is something that people don't want to talk about which is that how did Javed and I start the work we did from about 1986 onwards 93 we began combat formally but actually this whole turning began in around 1986 I don't even know you were born then but it was a very incredibly critical period for India I was a teenager then I'm just joking thank you for that very critical period for India very critical period for India because you saw so many things happening at the same time and if I just want to encapsulate those two three were one was of course we you you referred to it opening what Priyanka said opening of the talas of the Babri Masjid but not as as important was the reaction of the Muslim male clergy to the Shabano judgment okay now this was within weeks of each other both happening within weeks of each other and we saw as young journalists we saw that what awful effect it was having on the ground because the VHP VHP had made this the Babri the construction of the Ram Mandir their program from 86 onwards BJP adopted it a year or two later but the Shabanu judgment was like a manner from heaven for the right for the Hindutva right because the manner in which not just the Muslim male clergy reacted but the manner in which India's centrist party reacted which is the congress was was horrendous instead of negotiating and navigating with the vast majority of India's Muslims which includes its women you know they were negotiating with just a top heavy clergy and the response they were getting in terms of the shouting and the hordes and the slogan hearing was confirmed to that middle road a Hindu who had not gone over to that side that yes this is a section that wants special treatment under the law and wants is not even prepared to give 125 rupees for an old woman who's been divorced what does this mean you saw minority communalism feeding into majority communalism exactly what led me to do so much reading of my history pre-partition and I teach it now in the class to the 8, 9, 10 standards junior colleges that we have to understand the trajectory of this country between 1857 1847 to 1933 and then 1947 why till 1925 did you not see the emergence of these sectarian forces from both sides and then what happens between 1925 and 1937 when you first have the Muslim League pass up a Lahore resolution you know to believe for anybody to any critical thinker in India to believe that secularism can only be two things that secularism can only be a battle to for Hindus to become liberal and to Hindus to battle caste and that minority should not be touched I think it's not to understand what secularization of society means number one and I think number two is not to understand that historically this has always played up that minority communalism has played into majority communalism and whereas of course I agree with Nehru when he said that majority communalism is endangers the state because the structure of the state changes what happens to society when minority communalism is given a free hand and is not tackled is that it's three or four things first of all you don't give agency to the moderate liberal dissenting voices among Muslims you don't allow that you don't allow that leadership to emerge and you ignore the Muslim women completely you know and can you imagine something more horrific than the fact that it's under this regime that an issue like talaq is raised when organizations like the Indian Muslim for Secular Democracy which my husband partner represents has been talking against triple talaq polygamy and halal for like two decades and yet you know the it's just completely ignored by mainstream politicians so this lack of imagination encompasses even this that what is secularism secularism is not about giving Friday holidays to Muslims or to give the prophets birthday as a holiday to Muslims that's not what the vast majority of Indian Muslims have ever wanted it's like an insult to them the vast majority of Muslims in this country are working class artisans craftsmen self-made people and they're from the subaltern caste they're not from the Ashraf Syed caste who've been the leadership of the opposition parties they have been asking for their share in the economic social cake even within the community they haven't got it so I think if if political parties started articulating what India stands for in terms of all of this secularism means this secularism equality non-discrimination between various faiths and within communities as well I think if you have the moral courage to do that and I can't see which leaders are very few there are a few who do it in their own way I think it's it's possible that your disgruntled hassle voter who doesn't vote will get inspired to say yes we believe we are like Muslims who are secular we are Hindus or secular but we don't want this nonsense kind of secularism that you're electorally peddling out to us which is meaningless we want real secularism and I think the real secularism exists it's it's morally people are living it all the time Muslims have I mean if you look at today's Muslim you look at the number of Muslim girls who are kind of educating themselves they've not done it on a free lunch they've done it out of the battling patriarchy within the battling patriarchy within the families but they just need articulation why is opposition politics not keen on doing that and I think it's possible to do that it needs to and these things need to be said I mean when someone like Tikayat the farmers leader in Muzaffarnagar has that slogan Har Har Mahavadev Allahu Akbar it's a transformational moment because all of us are wondering Rakesh Tikayat used to be a fairly reactionary big big farmer but even that whole struggle and his interacting with the small farmer the middle farmer the woman farmer the Dalit farmer and his realization that where is this politics taking us has made him kind of utter those slogans you know even Mamata Banerjee when she was faced with a couple of times during the Bengal elections she was trying to articulate Ishwar Allah Tero Nam this is my secularism don't try and tell me when the I think the congress on the left hand try and put up an ultra right-wing Muslim against one of her candidates so we've seen glimmerings of that we've seen glimmerings of that but this needs to be an principled accepted position that we are going to battle for secularism which is intrinsic to intrinsic to this country staying one and united and that means no nonsense politics which talks about equality and discrimination so yes much more imagination is required and moral courage so i used to find it a little bit of"

        "message": "i won't use the word pseudo secular because i think it's a it's a it's an abuse term but i think it's uh it was a hollowed out secularism that was trying to be uh tom-tom and it's ironic that the same party that did that because it was a party let's not forget for 45 years uh also uh you know today even before kj val started playing its own version of soft hindutva now kj val has taken it to another obnoxious level so i think obviously i think that a lot of what happened and a lot of the ceding of power to the hindutva right has been possible because of the mistakes of earlier parties without question but on this point i really really feel very very strongly that so much ground was lot and it's not as if and you know it was both things and i want to join that as well because this is something that the hindu uh privileged castes and classes not all of them who support the hindu right need to understand and were rightly angry about what the congress did on this score is that they also did not do enough to protect the life and economic livelihood of minorities when it came to riots and all of that so both things were happening so you alienate even the minority by not doing enough whether it is an 84 with the sikh community or made at malayana nellie nellie was the first post-independence massacre of muslims in in bengali speaking muslims in asa so you see you did both things that you hollowed out the word secularism so much so that you neither like protected the life and livelihood of the religious minority as stringently as you should have done and equally well you hollowed it out by quote unquote these silly pampering acts which were meaningless through which you kind of created a coterie of this uh of male clergy privileged sections who became the spokespersons of the community with whereas the community had moved way ahead disgusted with that same leadership you know so you don't want to navigate or negotiate with a modern looking uh you know um you know a man or woman uh from from who may be a believing muslim maybe an agnostic but who definitely represents his or her community because he or she is going to question the way you look at her community that don't stereotype me i have been working i'm working that i'm a busty level worker i'm a self-made person uh please don't patronize me it was a relationship of patronage not a relationship of rights and i keep saying i used to say this because i have a certain equation with the muslim community because my work i used to say this in-house all the time that why do you have this relationship of patronage with the opposition party that time it was a ruling party demand it as your right as a citizen of this country as a citizen of this country you need to be protected you need to have economic livelihoods you you shouldn't and you should demand that every time wise you're taking four generations back every time there's a riot so much of your property is destroyed and you know this is under which regimes before before before 2002 you know so uh so it was both things happening i just wanted to table that equally well come this very good question you raised minuscule sections of the muslim community were raising this question of codification of the sharia law from the beginning and uh i don't think the hindu community should feel resentful about it they should be happy that at least that happened to them but they should certainly ask the question like indian all indians should as to why there was not a similar codification of the sharia bill i don't think uniform civil code is the way to go but the codification which will then ensure certain gender just provisions emerging and then if you want a certain gender just code or the special marriages act to become a more gender just and representative diverse thing certainly do that i think that's another very valid proposition when you've had voices within the muslim community raise this question again and again and again that please codify these three practices like like again i'll repeat polygamy triple talaq halala and others they don't exist in other muslim countries so why do they exist in india and yet this uh so that's the other thing that happened with the shah banu thing which is i think important to table here is that the the the creature called the muslim person of war that had been dead for about 80 90 years didn't exist in terms of the political consciousness of this country or community or the muslim community was resurrected by none other than rajiv kanthi because of that stupid exercise of getting that special law passed now never mind the fact that you know that law itself that muslim women divorce protection act has also been used by muslim women to get their rights because that's what people will do but but the impulse to pass that law to take out a question section of the community away from the purview of normal uh criminal law is it was what uh alienated large sections of the majority population so i think that is something we need to recognize that how do we view different communities when we govern what do we mean by secularization of society uh you know what do we mean by secularization of state so congress also precurs the uh majoritarianism in the state if you look at 1984 i mean if you look at mrs gandhi's statement that she made from jammu i remember i think 1980 i was horrified horrified when i read that when she said and that's why balasaheb devaraj of the rss had said that she's the tiger and we need to support her is that uh she was she said i'm faced with khalistan on one side and i'm faced with uh separatism in kashmir so i'm appealing to hindu india to vote for me you know so it's not as if the majoritarianism had not started creeping into the state as well earlier the the state in the latter years of the rule of the earlier opposition largely the congress but even even the coalitions did ignore the whole question of the communalization of the police force which was like a hugely a problematic issue which had thrown itself up i did a lot of investigative work on this when i started covering communal violence and found that and so so all of this built up into what we are seeing today you know so state agencies police governance in governance agencies it's one thing to be secular neutral uh you know that you don't really bring a live secularism but another thing to allow the induction of those kind of people who actually have an ideology which is hardcore rss and there's a big difference it happened started happening so you know veer"

        "message": "just kind of uh i mean let me just come to the last three years or four years in maharashtra okay and we had this experiment it's like a crazy experiment maharashtra vikasagadi and i don't think i could have believed anybody could have believed that such an experiment could have been even possible or whether it would succeed and i think it reasonably succeeded and i think the biggest test for it was covid the biggest test for it was a pandemic lockdown period if you look at the manner in which the lockdown was handled from delhi and from the thali punching and the lockdown and then that led to the millions of people i mean after partition it was the most miserable migration we saw of our migrant workers on the roads and how many of them lost their lives and all of that that was central government were inflicted and then we saw what happened in maharashtra i'm not saying other states didn't do it but i'm saying the manner in which it was handled in maharashtra far from perfect but far from bad the manner in which a man who became chief minister completely untested we know the background we know everything but the manner in which he sort of uh commandeered those uh one and a half years i think got respect from many of my friends in sitting in delhi uh who were even appalled by the way kaj kejwal handled the delta the second round where there was death and devastation in delhi and uttar pradesh and gujarat and others so my point is uh i think over intellectualizing uh and dismissing issues like federalism and diversity like you've done it won't help you'll need to concretize uh what i'm trying to say with with moments when this could have happened or can happen in future uh and can it happen realistically is the question we need to deal with okay that can this kind of diversification and uh decentralization actually happen or is it too far gone a story now and i think that's the challenge we will have to face and it's going to happen i believe because of the manner in which economics is going the manner in which the workforce pressures are going the manner in which agricultural pressures are going and the cultural and religious issues we are facing it i think that that is going to be the only solution people will finally find or we'll split up you know into god knows how many fragments because this kind of thing is unfeasible not feasible to continue for a long time so either you're going to be able to figure out and this is exactly what Kamal Nath is talking about every single day which is that we sitting in Bombay and Delhi don't read about what's happening in the south because the south has not mattered to our consciousness we are so north oriented you know we are so Delhi uh Sarkar oriented i mean this is a conversation that is happening every day when they're saying that we'll call you not union government with central government it's very very fundamental issues that are being raised and and those are successful strong governments that have raised them where there's a strong social justice component where there's also atrocities on Dalits and all that we know that so my point is it's happening at a real level also it's Maharashtra was an experiment Tamil Nadu is something else Kerala is something else so let's just see i mean let's just see i mean today what's happening in say Telangana and what TRS is trying to do what just came out in the papers this morning in terms of how it's i mean we know that they're trying to buy off these MLAs and MPs all the time how far is that buying out going to go because the politics that we are seeing which this regime has perpetrated Modi and Shah as you put it is not a genuine centralization of politics it is also huge amount of money throwing around after demonetization we everybody knows how this money got into their hands yet there's no institution that is prepared to question it yet so all of this is up in the air and out in the open it's known and yet it's unknown it's known and yet it's untackled you know so i think it's therefore not a fair level level playing field at all by any means whether it's the election commission you're talking about the courts that are willing to question etc so my point is we have to see how all this plays out is it going to be getting much much worse before it never gets better or is it going to get slightly better so there's going to be spaces created where there'll be more resistance that is the question"

        "message": "so before we go in for a break one sort of final question sparked by what you said about uddhav and this is just me thinking aloud in my grand tradition of randomly thinking aloud which is one thing that i really loved about uddhav was his style of speaking to the people where it's like he's speaking to a friend that you know angela merkel has the same thing for example where you're not declaiming in front of an audience grandly but it's it's personal it's intimate it's almost like a friend is speaking to you or you know your elder brother is speaking to you it's it's that kind of a connection and that leads me to thinking about a you mentioned earlier that across the world people seem to like strongman leaders so every once in a while that's the narrative that's a narrative no there's actually an evolutionary explanation for it that all our instincts evolved in prehistoric times we lived in small tribes uh you know it's a dog eat dog world you want the leader of your tribe to be the strongest bigger biggest mofo there is so it's perhaps you're instinctively drawn to leaders who appear to be strong yes but i don't think that's yeah but and i'll now come to what appears to be a completely unrelated subject that one movement i've seen in the creator economy is that whereas the superstars of yesterday and perhaps all the way till recently were people who were larger than life right so you have your amitabh bachchan and you have your uh shahrukh khan even and you build temples to them and they're just larger than life and today in the creator economy the people who do really well are people who are authentic to themselves who build an intimate connection you feel like they are your friend and i wonder if a similar sort of connect can be made in politics as well where it's not just the larger than life you know modiji declaiming in you know his shudh hindi or whatever but just someone like udhav sitting talking one-on-one almost as if he's a guest on a podcast kind of uh chatting with you and i wonder if a leader like that can also then get a mass following and and kind of get through i mean what what do you think because you've uh you've written a lot about the shiv sena in your book as well neither of us is too fond of udhav's dad for example and i'd done an episode on maharashtra politics with sujata anandan where she did kind of see it coming she saw udhav as someone who is you know not cut in the same mold what is your sense that is this that when we talk about a new politics do we need to look at a new politics not just in terms of issues but also in terms of manner of communicating and reaching out because as an activist you are communicating and reaching out all the time what do the people want what do you know see we need to understand that"

though it has changed so much and so and and it has always been juhu as home for me except except four years like i said when java then i moved out and started living together much the chagrin of my parents but anyway so that place where we live now is is off the beach on the beach and very lucky place to be because particularly now with all the like you said buildings coming up i won't call it a monstrosity but you know large buildings everywhere construction everywhere actually more than the buildings i feel the fact that they don't they don't allow trees around them as is mandatory required you know you're 14 inch spaces you should have trees that's another story but growing up was like uh so next to the bungalow where we live in now which was built in 1964 there's an older structure which is next door which is an old old bungalow and that is where my grandfather motilal moved in 1933 when he broke away from the family home at napiency road which is off settlevard lane over there it was named after jim and lal and he was a great man for the outdoors he liked he liked open spaces green spaces and all of that so he moved out with his two children atul usha was my aunt and atul and his wife and i remember that uh we growing up with these stories of his moving out and the older house and the new house as all families have and we still have a lovely black and white photograph of the napiency road home which is known as jim and lal's residence and when he moved here and my mother had this i saw it after my father passed the old land agreement on where my grandfather bought this property there's his signature and there's grd tatas so that was all tata land you know so and he didn't buy just this plot where we built the home in 64 the old bungalow he bought right he bought about like 20 bungalows worth of the whole stretch right from that where naval vakil's bungalow now is where now jai roo auntie lives right up to asha parikh's bungalow because his vision was that you know i'll move there and then i'll we'll sub sell these plots to friends and family and this this be one large community of all of us living together and it worked like that for about 25 30 years for him because i mean 40 years 50 years for him because 1933 we are talking about so for instance um my father and i were born in that 1933 that older bungalow and then this this place was vacant land and then there was my there was my one aunt another aunt then there was india bombay's very famous dentist bg bg kher's brother he had one bungalow then there was gajjar dr gajjar who was bombay's primer pathologist who was a friend of my grandfather so it was like that was that sort of a world where my grandfather did all that and then of course things started changing in the 70s when people sold off and buildings started coming up and everything but what i remembered is that there never was a there was never a compound wall so it was like a huge stretch of bungalows bungalows bungalow and gorgeous gardens and we used to just run through all of them as kids because it was like no question of security no question of uh walls or you know traversing gates or whatever so it was a very very lucky existence and the beach i mean for me the sea and the beach was everything and i remember right up to when i was 22 23 swimming off juhu beach and swimming at midnight by moonlight as well which much to the horror of my sister she'd be really worried because my parents wouldn't know i had sneaker so it was a safe beach it was a safe place it was a clean beach so it was quite quite quite nice and the sound of the sea has always meant huge amounts to me the sound of water in the sea but the sea and i think waves sort of always the gentle or the more ferocious waves always sort of reflected the mood i was in whether it was upset angry or very calm and i don't know why that has always always been a huge thing for me and my mother was a very avid gardener and painted planted huge number of trees and she was into you know biodiversity and indigenous trees and all of that and she was quite a bird watcher as well so a lot of that sort of came through i never had enough time for this till now now last 10 12 years with all my hectic stuff i love to cram in four five hours a week in the garden doing planting ensuring that i pot report do nursery stuff give plants to a lot of friends in because i think the more greenery you can spread the better so there was all of that books were a big thing i mean my father my father actually my grandfather had a library not so my grandfather my father was a crazy reader i mean he was one of the fastest readers i know i think my son after that and i am also quite a fast reader but my son reads very well so he would just devour and a lot of it was non-fiction so he had a fun he has a fantastic library so we had a benefit of that and also benefit of a father and mother who said that don't bother about your textbooks this is what you need to know you need to get into books marks are not important but the book knowledge from books is so i think that is also so precious and so important it was also lucky because one didn't have to get into the rat race of high marks and jobs but so it was obviously privilege but i think privilege used nicely you know rather than in a money also i remember something very intrinsic past of me is being very very my mother teaching us to be very frugal i mean she used to be very strict about money very strict so we never had pocket money in school ever everything you needed you asked for and then it was within limits you got it but only after 11 11th and 12th standard college we started getting pocket money and always public transport function within your even your films and your books have to be savings from your pocket money so i think these things are very important markers about what you become how you live how you relate to people i mean yeah money was there is there but it's also somebody something you respect you don't you're not crass about it you don't there's a humility that come i have this story which i always tell people and sometimes javed throws it back at me when i'm careless dada used to come we used to he used to be in delhi most of the time so the months he spent in juhu or the months we he had another lovely home in uti uttakamal the months we'd spend with him there in in whether it's here or we went to delhi to one of the lovely government bungalows or into saint patrick's in uti uh you know he'd take these morning and evening walks so i'd feel very important walking next to him so as a toddler i'd be walking aping him putting my hand at the back and walking and stuff and on the in the juhu bungalow it would be in the front lawn he'd go walking up and down so i remember once i think maybe i was in standard four or something and it was a sunset time walk and at moment i saw him go out from his bedroom i charged from mine to join him and he of course smiled and i started walking together and then i suddenly saw him turn back towards the house and go into my bedroom because i left the light on and he didn't yell he didn't shout but he just went and put off the light and came out and he said you know that so that that's those are kind of lessons you that stay with you that no wastage of electricity no wasted of money no wasted of resources you know you you you live you you have money you live in a fancy place but you you must remain grounded and respectful of people and what they are and and domestic help was always family their families were family i think all these things really are very very crucial to you and for me they were very precious so there was that and of course there was a constant engagement with current affairs news law politics a constant so newspapers reading the newspapers listening to like you were saying you know earlier that we were so starved of entertainment so listening to all india radio listening to whatever forms of news you go at was extremely important and then discussing that with my father at the dining and for me that that dining table for was an arena for discussion debate and argument and i think that it's it was it's it was such a precious site because my father would encourage both our sisters to argue and to contest what he said and i think that was the biggest lesson i learned in terms of parenting or in terms of teaching even which i started doing later is that you are not threatened by discussion or debate or argument that you need to encourage it at every step because that shows growth that shows evolution and and regardless of where that argument took us even if it was most bizarre things we said but he would encourage us to argue so the days when they would go out for dinner with friends or whatever it is i remember listening to the news bbc all india radio writing down all the important news points that i had to discuss with him the next day and i would leave the note for him i said this is what needs to be discussed tomorrow so i think that sort of discursive upbringing you know which is very adult even though you are growing minds you're treated as an adult you're given that respect your mind is given i think is is so important and then there are so many things you remember because the asian games took place when i was in college elphinstone college and that was a big thing because it was the first time india was hosting something internationally like that and very exciting for young people so we booked our tickets to delhi we said we'll go to the stadiums and watch and everything and all of that and we were there for a good week or 10 days watching all of this and then one weekend we took off that's a good friend of mine my sister and i we took off to jaipur just touristy kind of a thing to go and see the pink city when we were coming back and this was the early 80s 81 i think coming back to delhi and and we went by st bars the bus was stopped and all the sardar boys were asked to get off and they were frisked and i remember getting so agitated and upset by it so upset by it and i used to have this habit of constantly discussing everything with my father everything including things that really angered me upset me and that time there was only std phones not easy to call but i remember making sure that day i went to an std booth and taking extra coins and i said what are they doing okay we might be faced with this problem of khalistan or whatever but is this the way a state should deal with it if they want if there was a fear for a stadium in delhi or some terror attack they should have searched all of us why are you singling out one community the moment you do that you're going to alienate and anger that community you know and i experienced the same thing in 1995 in charar sharif when charar shir was burned in 95 when i was going from uh shinagar to yusmark so this attitude of the state of you know singling out had begun and i think this is what we were not able to see how to handle it and i was remember remember feeling very disturbed by it anyway so these are things you think back on you know that when you realize that an understanding was growing about some of these issues which you then engaged in later family was very important to my father and mother both so family holidays were like a huge thing he never ever did not take family holidays so a lot of it was with my grandfather in delhi either as attorney general or then a member of parliament law commission and all but also ooty so and in between we would go other places like we go to himachal or we go to kashmir was very very important to us because my uh there's a family connection actually because sheikh abdullah and my motilal were very close friends because my uh he was my grandfather had was the indian council and representative of the united nations for the indian position on kashmir and the fact that the sheikh had wanted to stay with india was a huge thing so they were very good personal friends so i remember when we went to kashmir one of the one of our family holidays uh he hosted us and it was such an awe-inspiring occasion that my father mother and the two of us they hosted us for tea and there was a keva and there was a macaroons from kashmir that we ate then the other time when we went to dalhousie and the dalai lama hosted us in a similar way because just these were like private meetings but i mean they meant so much because you realize these were really incredible people that you had a chance to meet simply because uh you had a chance to you happen to belong to this family or whatever it is so these were some of the things that stayed and there was one one little ditty that my sister and i would keep singing to ourselves which we were taught i think by somebody in the family which is that atul motilal chimanlal harilal brijrai harrai setelwal which would take all the of course it was very patriarchal because the women were not counted but it just showed the long lineage of lawyers in the family so there was all of that there was all of that and there was also the fact that my grandparents both sides vegetarian uh gujaratis but my father beef eating alcohol consuming atheist a sense of rationality that you make your choice so i used to ask him that how did you begin so it was because he went for his llm in post-war britain so he stopped drinking stopped drinking sugar in his tea but he started consuming beef so there were things like that which were very interesting and my mom was never really a committed non-vegetarian but she would indulge my father and she would eat a few things here and there she preferred vegetarian she preferred curries rather than meat as such but there was all of that there was all of that and we were of course both my sisters are non-vegetarian and there was no problem in the family on that my grandparents had no problem there was also a huge respect for girls and women's status in the family and education so the other thing i remember is my mother very strongly always saying that because she was also part of the settlement family from another side so they were second cousins so that dowry is something that was frowned upon during marriages so as a principle when there were marriages in the family the girls would never be given a dowry and that was one of the thing precursors discussions that you know and i think and that on the one hand and education and higher education for girls on the other so i think all of these things stay with you and you realize the value of that has come to you through a trajectory so there's it's a humbling experience also it's not something that you have"

        "message": "didn't do enough of it at some point and you feel that it would help you know i like to kind of make two comparisons one to your earlier earlier question and this one that there's something very very similar between the art of conversation and the art of letter writing and i was very lucky to grow up with fine conversationalists so i mean whether it's my father or my grandfather or another person who was very close to us H.M. Sirvai who was my father's senior and his son Navrose Sirvai who continues to be a very dear friend there was joy in conversation so and that conversation was personal political books poetry all of it intertwined so you realize that the time you spend together with such people and my father spent a lot of time with his chambermates what's lawyers call their chambermates so the parties for juniors were like big occasions for us because not only would a lot of good food be planned but there would be lots of very lively conversation so all the family friends we had all the chamber friends we had conversations were very important and these were not conversations about Shadi and Bihar and Dowry but they were conversations about life about what was happening around the emergency i mean the emergency was a huge thing in our childhood you know i've written about it also but i mean for me it was a formative moment when i'm in standard 10 in 77 when the elections are called and you have your parents both telling you that listen your studies are not as important as your campaigning to get this government out and you know in the pre-emergency in sorry in the pre-election period during the emergency it was the homes of the Settlewad and the Chaglas and the Bhatkals in Bombay that all these meetings would take place as to how the Janata party can come back and we need to get this government out and etc so you know that that's a heavy dose of life and politicization that happens and then you're out by public transport going to the Bhatkals place in Prabhadevi picking up posters and plastering posters all over town and the matter of great pride that Bombay returns six seats to the Janata party you know that so that sort of thing now these things don't happen just like that they happen as a lot of conversation my first letter to the editor in the India Today today was about Indira Gandhi's growing authoritarianism in 1978 and stuff like that so you know all of this is so much part of the same thing that you're thinking you're conversing you're learning through those conversations you have the benefit of some fine minds whom you're conversing with all the time I mean I became a life member of the PUCL at 15 years because my father paid the cheque for it and because he knew I was passionate about civil liberties so you know all of this is getting imbibed at various levels and you're writing you're writing by hand so I have my notes my essays my diary notes my letters to people and of course always encouraged by my mother to write letters to grandparents and others so writing and communicating was always important you know I mean the gift was not important but the letter was important and I was writing even before the JLT I was writing a lot at least once or twice a year I'd write long handwritten letters to close friends and family whom I felt like saying something to but after this experience I want to do it much more because now I feel it has to be something that has to become part of your life again it cannot be just something that you do to just say thank you for those letters but to try and continue because it is an important exercise to get some nice handmade paper from Chimanalaz to think of that letter pad write it out or recycle paper from an organization that does recycling work and and write it because I think it's that communication that receipt the receiving of that letter is so important and there's an old family friend of ours who lives in San Francisco and she half her half her time is spent in and that family is also in my very important part of my upbringing was my my mother's best school friend was Preeti Desai and her three sisters Jyoti, Sita and Bindu and one brother were like family to her and my father so we lots of holidays together and Bindu was Preeti and Bindu were like my political mentors cuttings about Palestine and cuttings about resistance in South Latin America South America all of that would come from the Guardian and the time that they would get and they would send it to me to read these we've lost the others but Sita's are there but Bindu is so much part of my life still she I got maybe five ten postcards from her in jail and she wrote to many of her academic and doctor friends all over the world who then wrote to me when I was inside so you know there's so much of this which is so important and continues to be important and why is it important only because you feel important at that moment or you feel loved no I think through every postcard that you get or letter that you get there is an idea there's a thought we are making a connection so Dilip D'Souza when he writes to you will be writing about his visit to Portugal where he saw that particular monument where he's which is writing about in the postcard that makes you reflect on that then you think of Mario Miranda and his postcard you know there's so many things that happen to you when you are reading and writing letters and the first letter I got in jail was on 27th of July and that was in an envelope and it was from Son Badra it was from the Adivasi union leaders women leaders Rajkumari and eight nine others had Angutha chapped it and they had written out this letter and it the my fellow inmates in the barrack six were saying what are all these letters why are you getting so many so then I would tell them about the women who have written them who's Rajkumari and who's Sukalo so about for an hour that conversation would take place till interest would wane I said no these are amazingly fantastic women you would never meet such women in your life they live in this thing they're fighting for their land and this thing writes they've been in jail twice I've been jailed only the first time so you know all these comparisons analogies become extremely important I don't know what it meant to my fellow inmates in barrack six but those conversations were very important to me to have"

journalist as well but never mind no but I just want to say that I think what is often forgotten is that you know how is the whole concept of the fourth estate evolved I mean the fourth estate both internationally and nationally within India and South Asia it's evolved as an entity or a thing which is outside the state which is for which is by its very inherent nature anti-establishment and needs to question structures of state and society so you need the independence you need autonomy etc then as you evolve further and you get into a democratic setup you know you have this notion of ensuring that the journalist or the media and we begin with print then we move to electronic and digital should be equipped to question every governance structure that exists within that democracy right now having said that step back for a minute and look at the way our national movement and the freedom movement given what I was saying earlier where you have our best leaders and even the using media for political mobilization so Gandhi as an editor Gandhi as a writer but there's young India Harijan all the publications he edited Babasaheb Ambedkar edited like 15 Mukhnayak so many of them so many of them and each one of them had a different stage and evolution so on the one hand I'm talking about the post independence what it ought to be or should be what it has become we'll come to later and what it has meant in terms of political emancipation I also flagged so it's very important to understand that the focus needs to always that of course the editorial in terms of comment and comment writing or feature writing is important but I think the journalists and publications and television channels and portals should never forget the primary duty is to report now reportage means what reportage means understanding the structure of society and state and having meticulous independent autonomous coverage of it okay so in traditional terms what this meant for us when we began was beat reporting okay beat reporting and what I would like to flag today is and I say this all the time because I take journalism classes also is I really bemoan the complete obfuscation and eradication of beat reporting today and I think this is very important so what am I saying here that you traditionally and there were lacunas there also it was not perfect so we'll come to that in a minute but what do I mean by I mean that how did we begin when we began as cub reporters or trainee reporter you begin with the crime beat then you go to the corporation beat then you I'm talking about cities then you go to the university beat then there's also health beat and then there's also science beat for the experts and there's also legal beat law beat court beat and there's of course the pinnacle which is everybody aspires to the political mantra elevator the vedan sudha beat or the parliament beat so these were the traditional I'm saying even then some of us were questioning like for instance we formed the women and media committee which I write about then there were the labor writers and all even then we would be moaning the fact that there was not enough attention paid to the labor beat workers issues agricultural beat no attention at all even that time or very little maybe sporadically when there was a drought but not as a big beat so farmers issues were not regularly covered agricultural issues were there was no environment and climate change was never really an issue you know so even then all this was being deepened and questioned but my point is that the beat journalism is gone never mind that those that didn't exist or were eroded didn't didn't exist even then you know so I think one of the things we really need to flag again today when we are looking at alternatives and your own experience Amit with this entire podcast is actually a reflection of this that to say that the market doesn't want it is bullshit you know I really whether it's with Bollywood and the kind of films being trashed out or whether it is media I don't buy that because who is deciding and who is giving we know the game of advertising what it was I mean it was it was all a bubble you told yourself that this is what worked and you told yourself this was the market wanted we know the world of TRPs where we know whether TRPs are represented or there enough critical studies on that so I think let's come back to the fact that who is honest enough to actually return to being a decent newspaper or a decent television channel or whatever and who is willing to back that financially because the issue really is ownership money and all of that which is what Vaya is trying to do that you know that funding by the viewer and all of that all experiments in the making we don't know if they're going to succeed in the long term scroll we just hope they do because if they don't then I think we are sunk because what little options we have will go so I think I'll return that I think there's looking at this entire business about number one reportage being as important as comment and when I mean by reportage I'm not about just individual fragmented stories but through those individual stories you're actually picking up trends you're picking up this thing and then you're doing an analysis so from the reportage comes the knowledge of analysis not just sitting in a editor's chair and doing the analysis with no knowledge of what's happening on the ground so today for instance and this is what I found so tragic and many of us were still involved with the Bombay Union of Journalists and the Delhi Union of Journalists is that you know 475 to 500 journalists lost their lives during COVID and it's not a national story just as you had nurses and Anganmadi workers and health workers who risked their lives so did journalists but it's not a story even for the media why would it be for politicians so you know I think this is where the huge disconnect lies that there are still journalists who want to do their job there's still journalists who are trying to do their job there's still journalists who are actually sacrificing lives for the job but they just don't get the visibility or the or the or the respect that they deserve maybe that was always the case but it is far more acute today so I'm just saying that you know so crisis reporting conflict reporting beat reporting and reporting before and no overemphasis on comment will itself sort of bring down the hysteria levels and the hate levels because I think facts speak stronger than words and many of the things that I'm talking about will actually the syncretism the lived secularism of people will also get reflected in those stories you know which is why there's a group of people in Tamil Nadu started this thing of My India or whatever they just report on all the good news stories because that's the other thing many of us used to feel as reporters that bad news is news but good news is no news you know so so much of this needs to be brought back to the debate obviously forms will change because media has changed so I'm not saying we go back in the in this go back four decades or three decades or two decades but we re-examine the proposition that are we doing justice to reportage and if reportage has to be engaged in fairly today of the various structures of governance how do we do it and if this is an age of shared news and syndication and shared platforms can this be done collectively I think these are some of the challenges that we need to do because the digital portals are trying it you know so you have a mukhnayak you have a wire you have very very interesting experiments you have a that Khabar Lahariya you have Gaon Ke Log many small and big interesting experiments taking place in the non in the non-english arena as well but this is no match for the kind of bombardment and this thing that we get from our electronic commercial channels I will I refuse to call them mainstream anymore they are commercial they're pure commerce so how does one counter this that is a huge challenge and of course some of our best journalistic minds are engaged in it but are they"

Kolpe and they saw that I was I was frenetic after the 92-93 violence I was really both a journalist active doing whatever I could really upset I'd also done the police violence messages exposed that which showed the communal violence and you know Kolpe said just sit down and listen to me this is not entirely new and that's what I remember that conversation I've gone back to free press I've still not located that clipping but he went back to when he was a reporter in free press journal and he covered the first first round of post-independence 1961 Jabalpur and what did he tell me I've written about this also he told me that he was sent to cover it 10 days after the violence had been raging and there'd been a set narrative nationally okay what was the narrative that this Muslim BD worker had abducted this Hindu girl and therefore the communal violence broken out he goes there he's sent by his editor that you go there something is wrong you go there cover it properly he goes and he meets the superintendent of police he meets all the like we all are supposed to do in the beat and he I remember him telling me he said you know those days he was a Kashmiri Pandit he was Hindu and he told me he said listen all the damages damages being being generated by this one rag which is published here which is RSS affiliate which has started this narrative and all the publications are syndicating and picking up from there there's no independent government yes there were issues between the families but it was a love marriage but the class was different this guy was a working class he was a Hindu she was a middle class girl he was a working class boy so obviously there was angst on both sides that you know it's the love jihad of that time if you like but it was not conflictual in the sense that is being made out and then it was it was a periphery that got into the act and the violence broke out so he wrote those pieces two or three pieces for free press journal and he got a letter from Nehru Pandit Nehru saying that you know thank you for doing a national service to the country by putting right the narrative so you know that strengthened my conviction on that but journalists need to be trained on how to cover communal violence just because you're a decent journalist doesn't mean you'll get it right because it's a particular kind of beast there are forces and organizations at work who are trying to generate a viciousness within us who are trying to generate hate within us who are using hate speech as the currency as their currency so unless we no one are able to catch that and the police often don't tell you about it or project it right or even prosecute it because there's a there's a infiltration there so you have to be alive to all of this and there will also minority communalism which is feeding into all of this so you know all these dimensions unless we are aware of when we are entering the field you can't just cover it i mean i was lucky because i was sensitized like this i was at that time and then i went my trajectory way i read more i talked a lot of senior journalists read up all the commission reports uh all the judicial commission reports on communal violence so that developed my analytical thinking but how many"

        "message": "entirely natural or is entirely taught right it's both correct so but if you're serious about what you're doing and i think i was extremely serious and honest about reporting on communal violence very honest i was always interrogating myself how do i put it down how do i communicate this because you know you are writing on something which is potentially uh you're going to reach people you enjoy a certain credibility then you it's all the more reason why you should be doing it extremely carefully before i try and answer it further i want to give you one more example of something like this in 1991 i was covering the rath yatra that rath yatra and uh that takes place in jamalpur every year ahemdabad i was in business india and i was lucky in business india allowed that space to explore the issue a little bit so it was not just like newspaper coverage where you were covering on a day-to-day basis so it was a particularly uh uh brutal brutalizing period that was happening all along because uh uh you had seen that whole development post 1986 and then of course it culminated in 2002 like i've written about but 1991 i actually traveled by train from bombay to baroda surat then surat to baroda surat then finally ended up in himmat nagar ahemdabad and i kept talking to people including businessmen who happened to be hindu and one just was really appalled by the level of crass hate that was being openly spoken about about the muslim minority but that apart that also reflected in my business story but uh this particular incident i remember being really very very horrified by which is that narangpura the posh area of ahemdabad uh one of the narratives of the vishwa hindu parishad at that time was to distribute to journalists this map of ahemdabad which was painted uh orange and green and i'm looking everywhere my people come a hoarder when i'm a real archivist but i can't find it to show that you know anytime a muslim couple or a mixed marriage couple try to move to a quote-unquote more elite area which by their definition was a hindu area they would ensure through violence to push them back and there were many such incidents one such was really brutal because this particular gentleman khan was his surname living in this building second floor of a building in narangpura obviously had moved out from the old city and in the height of the rathiata violence this couple of baksum gujrati sari-clad women had pushed him to his death from the second floor back it was something that chilled me because it was like so many things in that incident because it it was and how do you and how do you ensure that a community remains ghettoized and the brutality of the violence the fact that women are now engaging in communal violence as much as men which was not something i saw till 86 87 in the country at all so you saw the handiwork of the vishwa hindu parishad and the sadhvi then the sadhvi ritambaras as as icons you know it's working it's working in society so it was horrific at so many levels so anyway i was in the process of writing this book so i was speaking in nagpur and this is i think just a few months before the book came out in 2016 and there's a public meeting in nagpur where i narrated this incident and i write about this also in the book and after the meeting is over on the stage and all if you remember i see this young man sitting there and he's shaken really shaken right and he said ma'am can i have a word with you and all i said sure and he's he's a reporter for the times of india won't mention his name and he said i just want to finish your story you mentioned that incident and i was just 12 or 13 or 14 when it took place and it had chilled me and my family and i don't think you know this because you've reported gujarat so closely i'm telling you so you can round off the story that that navratri three months later those women were felicitated so you know you realize when you're writing coming back to your earlier question that how do you write these stories that you have to write about every nuance and every tone if you're honest about the story you have to also write the fact that when you reach godhra the first time i reached godhra godhra was on 21st 22nd of 21st 22nd of no no that was on 9th of march 21st 22nd was justice with justice varma that visit was preceded by so many rumors as to why godhra had taken place and you have to actually unravel those rumors so the rumor was one rumor for the majority community one rumor for the minority community all of that because you know by then you had tv internet emails had begun and all of that and one particular story i remember was about this muslim girl at the godhra platform who was eve-teased by the karsevaks okay so that incident happened it was bakrid that she was returned bakrid i was few days back so she was returning to baroda with her mother and her younger sister and she was in attractive teenager and she was actually eve-teased but what did the rumor among the muslim community say that she was pulled inside one of the compartments and something so you know the story becomes another story you know so one of the things i keep saying in my lectures to journalists and suggestions is never report incidents of communal violence unless you have verified every incident even of the survivor or the victim because because there is a tendency to of the of the untruth to also spiral into truth you know because that's how the rumor functions and rumor is something you have to really guard against as a journalist so long winded answer but to say that be honest be truthful cover every nuance but never forget that the human victim needs to be central to the story victim or survivor because you're not writing about numbers you're not writing about numbers of death but you're writing about a human being a set of human beings who've lost their dignity and life it is something you learn i don't think anything is just pure instinct or natural but it's something i learned because i was serious about continuing to cover it though it was a deep personal cost because it takes something out of you every time"

life he went straight after graduate coming out of iit he was a gold medalist and all he went straight to working in rural maharashtra joined an organization called freya and then isre so engaged with kind of alternate development working in marathwada the 71 drought and uh uh you know then a library movement in the state and all of that he entered journalism through a very unusual trajectory which was not planned like like i wanted to become a journalist is through the textile strike so he had started as a labor activist looking very closely at the whole reason of labor unions and all that and started reporting on the textile strike for the blitz and the daily and those reports had done very well and they were very very highly read and all that which is when russi karanji offered him a job of special correspondent in the daily so that's when his he sort of transitioned that was a couple of years before me so i joined in 83 and that's where we met and uh we got to know each other almost immediately in 84 we covered the communal violence together so i think it was a uh obviously it was a camaraderie and all that also respect for the profession but also i think apart from a kind of perspective on labor and human rights and generally i think this whole huge concern for the targeted and communal violence was a was also was a shared kind of shared concern and i remember long conversations with javid when he would come back from bivandi i would come back from covering bombay and you just needed to talk it out because it was so brutal you couldn't sort of rest that night before you had long conversations and sorted it out or nothing gets sorted but at least you share it and that was a huge binding time very difficult painful time but a binding time and then i decided to quit the daily within a year and few months because he got promoted to chief reporter and i just did not want to ever have the uh anybody because he got personally involved also i didn't want anybody to ever kind of and people will you know that's saying that i would get any and i was very clear and that i was a decent journalist i didn't want to get that thing about my having any favors because he was chief reporter so i had also begun doing a lot of legal reporting and i was covering the antulay trial so by then i got an offer from express so i shifted the moment i got it so it was i think a shared concern about where the country was going in terms of targeted violence and what i found was a huge complementarity was that of course i was hugely concerned about majoritarianism and the you know impending doom of hindutva which i saw but i realized that he had this capacity i think because of his own biography because he grew up as a believing muslim came to iit and iit sort of radicalized him completely so he became left and all of that but i remember him telling me that when he was younger he was not only would recite the quran but didn't want his mom to abandon the burqa and i can't imagine that to be the javed i know so there was a huge change so he would always be talking about the absence of rationalism within the muslim community and i would always need it needs to be talked about as much as majoritarian need to talk and i thought that was a very interesting dialectic because i was of course very concerned with the majoritarians of the community i was born into but he was always very interrogative of the regress in which he saw and the obduracy so among the leadership even over babri masjid of course everybody was extremely upset by the demolition but he he wrote this piece i remember which i thought was a pretty pretty brave piece he wrote i think in sunday observer which even siyasat carried translating it in urdu where he he was writing to the likes of shahabuddin that don't make this into hindu muslim battle make it a battle of the battle between the constitution and non-constitution and leave it to the majority to fight that battle because if you make it into hindu muslim battle you're not winning given the trajectory of pakistan and i remember not getting up slightly while writing that but realizing the sense of it because you saw extremely hysterical outpourings coming from the minority side which was matched then by the aggression from the majority side and the sufferer is always going to be the minority in in this situation and he was able to see that dialectic you know which which is a huge learning experience and continues to be because even he wrote this recent piece in the express on the hijab thing and i don't agree with it entirely because i think the education of a muslim girl is for me paramount even if she is forced by a pfi kind of outfit to wear the hijab but i i realize the importance of a javed and writing what he's saying is that that you know outfits like pfi cannot be given currency because they are just the flip side of the rss and they're a whole he says for instance that a whole generation of extremely intelligent muslims were lost to simi and now we are losing them to pfi you know and it's very sad that there's not a another kind of politics that young muslims are going into so there's there's there's that there's that engagement as a partnership which i think is always plot a complementarity to it we've also had very strong arguments but i think it adds a lot to your own perspective also so the so like he always says it's very important that this work is risky or she does the work she does but it's very important that i continue to do this kind of interrogation so i think and nature wise is much calmer than i am maybe but it's it's been a great partnership you know i've"

the i mentioned earlier in our conversation about 1991 and that khan sahib being pushed off the this thing so that is also the build-up that is even before combat so so this is something i'd been following i'd been following about gujarat and it just bother me because see at the end of the day my ancestors are from there i'm a gujarati i i spent at least one or two holidays a year in ahmedabad because my mother's maika my mother's mama was there we would go by gujarat mail we'd stay there dhargarh old city the cloth market the bera famous mutton samosas which my father would bring they were all part of one's upbringing so one knew ahmedabad and yet one was seeing this happening later much later as a journalist and as an activist and as combat particularly and you saw the lawyers associations getting bifurcated you saw teachers associations othering the muslims i mentioned earlier to you that i mean i was appalled because i chief justice of india later much later this is emma d one of our best chief justices hails from ahmedabad and a horrific story i heard from senior lawyers at that time was that when he was first appointed as chief justice and this i heard retrospectively he said several sessions lower courts went on strike how could a muslim be a chief justice i mean this unheard of in any other part of india at that time so what was it about gujarat that this was possible why was it happening who was making it happen and i remember one of the in face to face with fascism i tried to deal with some of this in earlier stories i tried to deal with it uh is is ask this question that what was it about the gujarat's uh socio-political territory the political economy that allowed this kind of othering to happen so one of course i said before that i think there was a particular vhp rss project that discredited gandhi because gandhi was their biggest hurdle uh in terms of hindurashtra you know so they they got him dead but they couldn't kill him so easily so so discredit him in the line but that was a broad sweep statement what what next i think the fact that like i said earlier that anti-caste movement social reform movements only went up to so much and didn't go further in gurus not that there were no movements but they didn't go as radically deep as say they went in maharashtra or karnataka or whatever i think that was important the other another factor was that so for instance dalits they will call themselves harijan they won't call themselves dalit you know and i think the trade unions only are mostly gandhian and socialist they're not really left except in certain pockets so these are some of the patchy sort of insights one started getting or started this thing and then girish bhai patel was a senior lawyer and activist amazing personality i would have conversations with him and others and try and understand what is it about gujarat and talk about the land reform movement never having gone below the patel community patel is like the forward obc like the maratha years so you didn't really have land getting into the hand of dalit farmers but then how many states has it gone even punjab you've not had it gone to dalit farmers but still you don't have this level of deep-rooted communalization so it's a complex story not yet figured it all out but one certainly was doing reportage and investigations to warn people that something awful seemed to be nothing because there was this galvanization of the mob our private armies weaponization all of that threshold distribution so anytime there was this group of people fed on hatred and narratives that was available for a project and you know unfortunately we saw that happen so i think that is why i did those stories and it was no great satisfaction for me long before 2002 at every meeting one would address to keep telling people that please pay attention to gujarat something terrible seems to be building up there we are not paying enough attention and i think and we're very very sad to say that it happened and you know the one thing i wanted to just mention because so many things i when i go back to those cover stories i did the first one that you mentioned welcome to hindurashtra 1998 just the one after that we did one on the taliban in afghanistan which is what combat was about i'm mentioning that was hell on earth and i did this telephonic std call interview with the revolutionary association of afghan women and nobody in south asia at that time certainly not india today our premiere magazine sunday magazine none of them were bothering to look at the you know majoritarianism there or whatever it was only after bamiyan buddhas in 2001 that everybody started waking up to what the taliban was but but we were trying to look at this everywhere i'm trying to look at i mean i visited uh uh sri lanka in 1997 and wrote about the majority and buddhist tendencies there so one was trying to understand this as a phenomenon not just to do with the hindu religion but whenever the majority hindu religion gets means majority religion gets close to state power what are the potential disasters that can happen so coming back to that welcome to hindurashtra story you know it's not a coincidence that the two villages that are mentioned there which is based on a pocl report at the time randikpur and sanjeevi where for a three-month period after a brutal attack on the muslims living there they were living outside their village for three months till somehow they crept that is exactly the area around which bilkis was then in 2002 gang rape just outside randikpur so i mean what do these connections mean what does this trajectory mean what do we ignore as society and state for the build-up i mean i still remember doing this interview which is there in that issue of combat i think it is the same issue welcome to hindurashtra where i interviewed uh then director general of police cp singh and i asked him i said listen you know there's this constant rumors of love jihad the love jihad was not a phrase till after the bamiyan buddhas but inter inter-community marriages and all rumors around them that they are forced and they are this thing in fact babu badrangi went into a whole racket with patel girls at that time uh and i said that how true is it that these forced marriages are happening you know the gujarat government under keshubhai patel had set up a cell in the police to investigate inter-community marriages a completely unconstitutional act because once you're above 18 you can marry whom you want in this country but yet the gujarat government had done this so it was the government that was functioning out of the purview of the indian constitution for a long time i asked director general this question he said all those stories are based on rumors and they're untrue we have investigated each one of these cases and they're all voluntary marriages i've quoted him in combat on that so the rational the rational debate is one thing the facts are something else but yet something completely"

look at supporting survivors of targeted violence then we look at the whole issue of constitutional values in the classroom and now we're looking at citizenship rights so basically legal rights and legal aid is the concept behind cjp and you know if we wanted to engage in battling those cases of course gujarat 2002 but not only that because we've also done engagements with bomb blast survivors 26 11 before that in gujarat etc uh it's important to see what that whole process of engagement will mean it means understanding the law it means legal aid it means uh staying with the survivor for for periods of time that are long because our court process takes so long you know and advocacy and all of that so that is why it was set up and many of the persons then and now were involved in cjp had seen bombay burn in 92 93 so i thought that was a very important understanding and link that came out of that now of course we have some new people also and the it was very important to have that that thing in place now i just want to say that you know the experience we got out of 92 93 bombay where we didn't actually engage in the courts but we were engaged in the campaigning for the sri krishna commission report to make sure the report was published getting it published we actually published the report two editions of it was also very important to understand that you know that do we stop there or do we now get into the courts and also battle the cases so that was one part of the story and now we've actually reached a stage which is very fascinating because i think the experience has also meant that you know for for human rights and civil liberties and legal aid to be used in the courts and to and legal aid to be sustaining and enduring we need to create local teams on the ground so therefore to have this team that's going in asam which is a really vibrant team of 25 plus people paralegal and lawyers who are working on the question of citizenship i don't know how many people in the rest of india know but this whole nrc process national register of citizens process which which it's important to tell your listeners this because you know asam has a 3.3 crore roughly population and at least a third of them are kind of completely being there's a humanitarian crisis of huge proportions so there's a background and trajectory to it but the conflict and the violence in asam pre and post the asam accord has led to kind of led to kind of demand quote unquote that outsiders should be identified and citizens should be citizenship should be scrutinized in a particular way and the matter was taken to the supreme court and all of that it's a complicated thing and on the cjp website you get a lot of information about it in 2016-17 when the draft list was brought out draft final list as many as 44 lakh people were left out of citizenship which is like a huge number then when the final final list came in in 2019 which is august 31st the number came down to 19 lakhs now even that is being contested by the political class they seem to want to reopen it further but what has this entire process meant first of all it's a huge cost to the state exchequer figures like 1700 1800 crores are being crores are being thrown around this is the kind of money that has been worsted on this whole exercise but it has meant that virtually in every village in the state of asam you have families and extended families who are completely devastated by this and their meager allowances are being spent on you know trying to navigate a very very hostile legal system the foreigner tribunal etc now you have something a creature called the foreigner tribunal in asam which is a kind of a legal entity pre-independence under the foreigners act very complicated which is doesn't happen anywhere else in india and the the adjudication there the level of evidence gathering there is completely contra to what the indian evidence act says so you know all of this has meant first of all me and our team understanding this issue then us trying to do legal education with batch of lawyers who have been doing this for a long time but trying to discuss and how we can do it better understanding the superior court judgments high court and supreme court and trying to bring in national and international law so all this been a very intense exercise for the last seven years and we've been very lucky to build up a very very vibrant team and the work carries on day to day week to week and village to village in about 12 districts and for me the greatest satisfaction when i was incarcerated the last three four months is that the work of this kind whether it was hate watch or assam or constitutional class in the classroom in purvanchal continued and i think there was a first shell shocked of the first week when it all happened and i was arrested but after that teams galvanized and motivated each other and the work carried on and for me that is the biggest answer to this kind of strategy and this kind of targeting is that the work should not stop the work simply should not stop that's inspiring you know why"

thing was that she herself had given previous statements to the national human rights commission signed affidavits to the nana vati commission where they were you know where the whole version had been laid out so her suddenly saying that all of this was not correct or was coerced out of me was could not hold out in a court of law and i went to the supreme court you know saying that her allegations are serious and please investigate which very few people know i said that when she made those allegations i said please investigate and that's when the supreme court set up a registrar uh general's inquiry we all appeared she had to appear and then that is that inquiry that found her guilty of perjury and all of that so but it's a arduous process to kind of counter all of that's right coming back to what i'd said earlier that once you engage in it there's a risk of this happening then it's an arduous process to then have correction and a lot of energy goes into that as much as fighting the actual battle besides that what i want to say that technology is it's it's not an apolitical beast okay so let's not completely glamorize it because i want to just flag five six very very problematic things that have happened with the same technology and not with the kind of result that you're yes certainly it's coming to the public gaze but it has not generated the kind of outrage that at least i would want and i'm sure you would want and one is this recent public flogging of muslim young men in kheda other one was a similar kind of incident in jharkhand which uh which where you had this horrendous killing and lynching and all of these are being captured on through technology by the perpetrators you know so they're not attempting to hide them they're actually wanting to play to the uh the support base that you were talking about to be able to galvanize more hysteria and hate uh in their corner so i think let's also flag that issue when you when you raise this question and having said that yes if if technology is truly democratized and has it been i don't think so i think it's not been democratized if you really look at how deep penetration internet is uh uh it's i think it's it's a patchy story i wouldn't say it's a negative story but it's a patchy story i mean even now there are a place in uttar pradesh including banaras and others where it's very bad internet penetration is very bad so you can't have zoom calls and conversations so it's i'm just saying that let's also be very clear that the penetration is very patchy i'm not uh and if somebody would like you were to map where india has really good broadband i think it might tell a different kind of story so yes it is possible and feasible today that there's going to be a huge god forbid a huge targeted violence tragedy or something happens that's either for the wrong reasons like i mentioned or for the right reasons it will get documented my question is again coming back to what i was thinking as a journalist what happens then does it generate the kind of response it ought to or should have from either the the institutions that i request required to correct it or from the political opposition that should take it up that also is not happening enough is what i feel because i mean just to give this take up this first example i gave of the flogging you just see that the two major parties in political opposition in gujarat who are now claiming that they might make some headway i don't know about winning that is congress and up have just not commented on that incident and i don't know what kind of message that sends to either the citizenry which is part of the community that of the policemen that perpetrated it or the survivor victims that have undergone such a humiliation what does it mean what is that what is that signaling mean i have not seen one of my one of my constructive criticisms for the higher judiciary which is high courts and supreme court is that they have a very interesting power called the suo moto which is that you can actually see some violations of fundamental rights taking place through the media through the social media and actually generate a legal action without it being brought to your notice and there have been occasions when the court has done that but those occasions are very rare i have not seen any constitutional courts be it in jharkhand or anywhere up or gujarat or anywhere actually initiate sumo to action on these kind of public violent humiliations and targeted violence against minorities for a long long time it didn't happen earlier didn't happen it's not even happen earlier even before so i don't i will not put the 2014 marker for that you know even it did not happen in nelly did not happen in 84 in fact i've had very very intense discussions with advocate hs fulka who's a one of the advocates who's really stuck by the sikh survivors of the 84 pogrom where the congress party was involved and he says that you know the kind of silence he encountered from the institutions was was was awful and in fact at least in gujarat we got a few glimmerings of hope with a couple of very good judgments from the supreme court transferring best bakery bilkis bano out of the state sending certain signals whereas they got nothing so you know i think some of these introspections are important and necessary as to when was it the national security narrative around mrs gandhi's killing uh that it was a sick body what was it that prevented uh the higher constitutional courts from intervening because it was delhi it was happening in delhi so you could not claim that you did not know every wretched resident of the capital would know judge or not a judge so why was that no there was no sumo to action i mean these are issues that need wider discussion and debate and i think some of this is also linked to the fact that we need to have sane sensible debates and conversations about institutions without hysterical responses or be or be threatened contempt of court or anything because i think you're not talking about crass motives sometimes what you're talking about is a general level of lack of accountability and i think that is something that citizens should start engaging in you know so whether it's a question of how higher courts deal with uh sexual assault or rape or in posco cases when you have a string of judgments suddenly it's not string but i've seen at least three or four saying that you know everything will be fine as long as the the perpetrator marries the victim i mean i just just the thought makes me cringe you know that is this a notion of substantive justice in the criminal law amendment by the way i have to point out i did"

        "message": "no i just like to uh nuance your second proposition um while not discounting the first and third at all which is yes the society today that is the kind of huge support echo chamber for this kind of political dispensation that is our problem i'll reiterate what i said right in the beginning i think is that you know what are the numbers are we talking about i mean where do we balance the numbers yes there is no question in my mind that a large section of our society has become the support chamber the support base for this kind of politics but i'm not still willing to believe that it has crossed 50 51 i mean that too on the very outside okay so that is the first thing the question is what about the rest are the rest and uncaring couldn't they couldn't care one way or the other are they scared are they scattered what is it that is what we need to figure out i don't have a uh pat answer for that i think it's some of all these three that they are uncaring some of them but i think a lot a lot of them are also scared and many of them are scattered so the question is the scattered and the scared what do you do with that how do you work with that etc so that's that's the first thing i just like to first drop in the in my response secondly i think i don't think one can hope and this thing hope any that hope for the state to improve and all of that no but i think if one accepts the fact that at the moment the structure exists and the fact is that for whatever reason we are a notional or real not so real democracy then do we or do we not speak and i'm asking you this question back do we do we or do we not speak about things like uh eventually you have the preamble which makes the people sovereign not the state and therefore every decision of parliament every decision of the supreme court every decision of the election commission that is constitutional bodies is eventually answerable to the people at some level obviously in an organized fashion so how do this mass of people become articulate enough to be able to challenge anything that they find so different wings of the state if you desegregate because it's too overwhelming otherwise how do you desegregate and actually start challenging this and can you do it at all that's the question so can you really realistically talk about judicial reform is it ever going to happen or no our is the appointment of judges the diversity of judges never really going to change okay those are the questions i think we need to keep raising okay and i think in the raising of the questions you will maybe get some answers there cannot be one person or three people giving you the pat answer one of the major reasons and this was stated by i think by mr sybil the other day when he was being a couple civil when he was being felicitated for 50 years at the bar is that you know what you need today is a lawyer's movement for social justice to counter uh the kind of uh silence that is there from the bar today when there's according to him wrongs done by sections of the judiciary so you know this could be one answer i don't know but the point is i know from a fact from my father father and grandfather and great-grandfather and everything that they've experienced from their writings that the bar and the bench are intrinsically linked okay when you say bar is the not the that bar but the bar which is the advocacy advocates so if the bar becomes supine like it did during the emergency except a few outstanding voices then the judiciary also will just have one dissenting hr khanna okay but i remember that that year in 1973 when the super session took place uh kc college june i mean an amazing meeting takes place i still have the booklet from that meeting where you who did you have you had daftari you had hidayatullah you had uh setelvar you had kt shah nani palkhiwala all of them speaking about on the outrageous act of the government and superseding and making ray the chief justice so you know there will be those moments now was that unimportant was that dissent not important i think we the fact that we are referring it to it today in a conversation means that those dissents become very very important to the growth of a democracy do i see that dissent today from the bar no which is why leads someone like mr kapil sibal to make that statement it's coming it's coming from other sections of the lawyers and advocates who are not the big big names but it's coming from dogged practitioners who are working you know on the most difficult of cases so uh the issue is how do we then tackle this all this indian state as you put it do we just give up on tackling on it or do we try and maybe think of ways to segregate the different wings of it and think of talking about chipping away and challenging i mean the way the election commission has started behaving is outrageous it's been written about it's been talked about one or two previous election commissioners are somewhat writing about it but that's not enough i mean they have to be able to understand that the voters at some point is eventually whom they are responsible to not the government of the day but when will those voters get mobilized outside an adr association of democratic reforms to challenge the election commission that becomes the question of people's mobilization resistance etc it's a very tough call because it means organizing it means organizing non-violently in a cohesive way in an informed way communicating this challenge you know all of this means working on electoral reform judicial reform structural reform criminal justice reform i mean what was my lessons that what was the lesson that we learned after the best bakery case was that four things are necessary in our criminal justice system first is independence of investigation which is police reform which nine police commissions have told us we should do but nobody wants to do but it's not a citizen's issue it's not an election issue how do we make it that okay then the question of independence of prosecution because only i think two or three states in the country have the judiciary appointing the prosecutors otherwise it's the government appointing the prosecutor so again you have a collusion when the cases are argued then witness protection which again came to the fore with the Zahira Sheikh case and finally time-bound trials you can't have criminal trials going on for 10 11 no survivor will have the will have the stamina to even want to live through that tragedy for 12 why should he or she you want to wrap up and move on right so two or three years time-bound trials now these are very simple things it's not rocket science that i'm sharing with you but who is going to push it which band of citizens is going to push which political party to make this into an issue i mean it's it's really not an easy call but the question is whether it needs to be taken or not"
