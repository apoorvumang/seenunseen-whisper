        "message": "The purpose of the organization was to set protocols by which mail could be exchanged between the 22 different nations that were part of it. You could say to create the HTTP of the offline world. As the 19th century drew to an end, one of the problems it faced was how to enable a person in one country to pay the return postage for a letter from another country. For example, an Italian immigrant to America might send a letter to Italy to his aged parents and may want to enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope so that they can reply without having to buy stamps. But obviously, American stamps will not work in Italy and he can't buy Italian stamps in America. So what to do? The Universal Postal Union came up with a clever solution in 1904. This was basically an international stamp called the International Reply Coupon or an IRC, which would be valid anywhere and which could be purchased in any of these countries for a fixed amount of local currency. The system works superbly and aspiring writers of a certain vintage may remember that as recently as the 1990s, publications abroad would ask you to submit your writing to them with an International Reply Coupon so that the polite rejection letter they would send you would be at your cost. Now the Universal Postal Union is an upstanding organization and not the subject of this episode, but their IRCs set in motion an interesting scheme. Now remember, these coupons could be bought across all these countries for a set amount of local currency. But what happened when currencies fluctuated? An IRC would automatically become cheaper in one country than another. And currencies did fluctuate wildly because of World War I. As the war came to an end in 1919, an Italian immigrant in Boston received some International Reply Coupons in a mail from Spain. He realized the opportunity for arbitrage here. He calculated that if he bought $1 worth of IRCs in Rome, it would be worth $3.30 in Boston, a profit of 230%. Other countries had even more devalued currencies, such as Austria, and he could make even more money there. So he formulated a business plan. Buy IRCs cheap in Europe, make a profit selling them in the US. This was an entirely legitimate business plan. There's nothing wrong with buying cheap and selling expensive. Our man needed money for this though, and he had already burnt his fingers with various failed enterprises in the 15 years since he'd left Italy. No one was going to lend him large sums of money, but he figured he could get the capital he needed from small investors. He formed a company called the Securities Exchange Company, the SEC, which sounds respectable, and advertised a scheme promising that anyone who invested money with him would get a 50% return in 45 days. This is a mad rate of return. He even turned a few of his initial investors into agents, giving them 10% of whatever investments they got in. Everyone who invested automatically became an evangelist of the company, as they rationalized their investment and began recommending it to others. Over time, as initial batches of investors actually received that 50% interest, they became bhakts. They often reinvested their money while selling property to gather other funds to invest. Old women invested their savings of a lifetime. Early men mortgaged their homes to add to their savings that they'd already invested. In February 1920, the total investments in this scheme were only $5,000. A month later, $30,000. By May, over $400,000. By July, it was bringing in millions. Once newspaper coverage started in late July, it started bringing in a quarter of a million dollars a day. Estimates of how much money was invested in the scheme vary from 15 to 20 million dollars, and 20 million in those days would be around 250 million today, close to 2000 crore rupees. The thing is, none of this money was actually invested in IRCs. Our enterprising entrepreneur found it hard to get hold of IRCs bought in Europe and found no way to sell them in the US. Also, the total number of international reply coupons available worldwide was a fraction of the number that the invested money would buy. So the scheme clearly could not work. How did the whole enterprise work then? Simple. The securities exchange company basically paid out its investors from the money of later investors. Put simply, the first batch would be paid out by the money of the second batch, the second batch by the money of the third batch. And as long as the investments kept increasing, as they did because of the high praise by earlier payouts, all would be well. But at some point, this would have to end and the whole scheme would collapse, as this one did. This sort of fraud, robbing Peter to pay Paul, goes back through the ages. But in the popular imagination, they are now known by the name of this Italian immigrant who founded the securities exchange company, Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmi Tebaldo Ponzi,"

        "message": "So basically, you know, I mean, I don't have any internal information. But from what I have read in the media, what he seems to be doing is, you know, he is offering his shares as a collateral, raising money against those shares and buying new shares and then offering those shares as a collateral, raising more money and buying even more new shares. So, you know, so if you know, if you look at it from what you just said, this seems to have a structure of a Ponzi scheme and so which is where it is important to differentiate, you know, Ponzi schemes can be fraudulent and then there can be schemes which have a structure of a Ponzi scheme, but the idea is not to defraud anyone. So in this case, obviously, you know, the idea is not to defraud anyone. But if you look at the overall structure of all these platform companies, they have a very, very Ponzi structure. Now, why is that? That is simply because, you know, what they are aiming for is a monopoly in their line of business. Now, there's a concept called network externality, which basically means that, you know, with every extra user on a particular network, the value of that network goes up. So to give you a, you know, a very, very simple example, Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Now, if only Mr. Graham Bell continued to have the telephone, it wouldn't have made any sense. But let's say, you know, one more guy started having a telephone. So then Mr. Graham Bell could talk to that guy, then another guy, you know, had a telephone and so on. So more the number of people, you know, who had a telephone, the more the value of the telephone went up, or to give you a more contemporary example, all of us are, you know, there on Facebook, because all of us are there on Facebook, right? We're not there on any other social media network of the kind that Facebook is. There were other networks of that kind, there was MySpace, there was Orkut, which was particularly, you know, very, very popular in India. But once Facebook sort of became the place to be in, everyone sort of moved to Facebook. Now, what happens here is now, how does it apply in Oyo's case? Now, Oyo is in the business of renting out hotel rooms, okay. So obviously, it needs hotels to list on the website. And it also needs people to come onto the website and book those rooms. Now, so basically supply and demand. Now, how does it create demand? It creates demand by offering discounts, so that people come in and book rooms on Oyo. So the more people who come on to Oyo to book rooms, the more, you know, hotels should be interested in listing themselves on Oyo. And now, how do you get more people to sort of come on to the network is by offering huge discounts. And what happens is that the discounts are so huge, and not just in case of Oyo, I mean, it works across any other, you know, platform company, you know, right from the way Uber and Ola started to how Swiggy and Zomato are working right now, is, I mean, you offer large discounts and because of that, you face what is known as high cash burn rate, okay. Now, this is just basically a jargon, which the platform guys use for, you know, for a simple word of operating losses, I mean, you operate at a level where the price that you sell your product at is not profitable. Now, in order to keep going, they need new money to keep coming in. And as long as the new money that keeps coming in is greater than the cash burn rate, the company keeps operating. So which is why, you know, if you look at Oyo, given their international aspirations, they need a lot of money because, you know, how do you get people on to Oyo if you don't offer discounts? So if you look at the structure, the structure is very similar to that of a Ponzi scheme where the money being brought in by investors, as long as it is greater than the money going out, which is basically the losses that the company is facing, the company keeps running. Now, the aim here is to become a monopoly in that particular area and then sort of make all the money that you can, I mean, monopolies can simply make money by existing. So that is what every VC wants. That is what every leader of a platform company wants. Now, the thing is, it doesn't, you know, it happens, but it doesn't happen with all companies and not all the time. So let's take the example of the search engine business. Now, you and I will remember that when the internet first came to India, there was nothing like Google. There was, you know, there was AltaVista, there was Yahoo, there was even something called AskJeeves.com. And then Google came along in 2000 and gradually took over the entire business. And now the only search engine that, you know, most of the world uses is Google, unless you are in China. I mean, then that's a different story. So Google makes monopoly profits, same is the case with Amazon. So the way the entire platform business has evolved is, you know, is very, very Ponzi in structure, because everyone wants to be a monopoly."

        "message": "So I think in the course of your explanation, there are basically four separate kind of points that you're making, and I'd like to sort of break them up one by one. One is, of course, a standard Ponzi scheme, where you correctly point out that a Ponzi structure may not always be part of a fraud. In this case, the structure that Ritesh Agarwal used to buy back his shares is like a Ponzi structure in the sense that he is first, you know, using his existing stake to buy a further stake and then using that to buy further and so on and so forth, which has a very Ponzi like feel to it. And we'll come back to discussing Ponzi structures and frauds in the rest of this episode. The second point is about network externalities, which, you know, is something that all networks obviously. I mean, I mean, that's how these big sites like Amazon and eBay and what OYO is attempting to do and Somato and so on, that's kind of how they function. And there's nothing about it, which is not legit, it's standard, it's, you know, there's nothing per se, wrong with that logic, and I don't even know why it's Ponzi-like. What you sort of refer to as Ponzi-like is, I think, and which I was going to ask you about separately anyway, is that the structure through which these guys get one round of investing and then another and then another, which is really the greater fool theory where everyone is investing. And in some cases, you don't really care whether the business is viable at that stage or is ever going to be viable. All you want is at a later stage of funding, you can sell your share and move on."

So in fact, so a lot of the for example, Ritesh Agarwal's buyback of his shares is actually the people he's buying out are the early investors of the company. So even if OYO eventually fails, those the early investors can all say that we made a wise choice because they actually sold at a profit, they invested something, they sold at a profit, maybe they sold to, you know, SoftBank or to Ritesh Agarwal himself, it doesn't matter. Ritesh Agarwal, of course, he's getting the financing for this from Nomura, which has a heavy SoftBank investment. And I find it sort of hard to comprehend how they can be a greater fool in the sense at this scale, there is no one SoftBank can sell these shares to, where is the cash out for them, unless they do an IPO at insane valuations and common investors."

        "message": "Right. So, the fourth point that you raised that I kind of want to talk about is the monopolies aspect. Obviously, every business wants a monopoly, though the thing here is that a monopoly is only problematic when consumers suffer. The argument I would make in the case of the seeming monopolies that Amazon and Google have built up is that, number one, they are monopolies only if you sort of consider what they are doing in a narrow way. For example, Facebook is a monopoly in social media, yeah. But the point is that they're not a monopoly when it comes to how do you spend your time or how you connect with others or how you communicate with others, where there is a lot of competition. So in that strict sense, they're not a monopoly. Second, there are no barriers to entry. Other people can and do enter all the time. And even a seeming monopoly at a particular point in time, like Microsoft once, may be completely irrelevant a decade later. And the third point is that as far as any of these so-called Internet monopolies are concerned, we are still getting extremely cheap prices from Amazon. We are still getting Google search delivered to us free. We are still, you know, not having to pay for Facebook. So I don't really, I mean, first of all, I would object to the definition of those companies as monopolies. And secondly, I would say that, you know, there are no barriers to entry as such. And as long as consumers don't suffer for it, like I hear a lot of alarmists talk about how that they will now spend VC money, they will build up a monopoly and after they have driven everyone out of the market, they will raise prices, and consumers will suffer."

If you look at what is happening with Uber and Ola, and at least in the last one year, is that prices have gone up dramatically. And now it's reached a stage where, because they've managed to destroy, and I'm talking about Mumbai here, not the other cities, because they've managed to destroy a large part of the normal Kali Pili business, there is an overall shortage of cabs. So you get so earlier, what used to happen was the P cars used to start sometime in, you know, in the evening. Now there are, you know, prices are high, almost all through the day. So there are I mean, so there are issues, it's not as straightforward as I agree with you on Google."

        "message": "And you know, but my argument about Uber and Ola is that number one, they brought a necessary disruption and raise the supply and the supply is still higher. Like, for example, when I left home today, I didn't feel like driving, I was guaranteed an Uber, maybe I paid more for it than I would have liked to because of peak surcharge, but fine. And I could also have taken an auto but the point is the autos were there if I was in South Mumbai, I would also get the Kali Pili. What has happened is that the supply has gone up the number of people who can rely on public transport has gone up massively like so many women tell me that they feel much safer because along with all the other options which still exist, they also have the relative safety of an Uber or an Ola. I mean, they have added to the options and I won't be convinced that they've actually made the public transportation market worse till I actually see data on it. Because my anecdotal experience sort of indicates that, you know, but anyway, I mean, that's another argument for another day, that's another argument for another day, we can agree to disagree and listeners can make up their own mind on that. But all of this apart, I mean, what really struck me as a Ponzi element was that the fact that he is pledging his existing shares to buy more shares and then pledging those to you know, buy more shares and it's not really a scam because these are willing participants. I think Nomura is giving him the money Nomura is also funded by SoftBank. Basically, this seems to be like SoftBank fooling itself, which they are entirely entitled"

So one of the earliest, you know, guys who sort of became famous for running Ponzi schemes was actually an employee of, he was a bus conductor called Ashok Sheregar. And he ran a number of Ponzi schemes in Mumbai, the famous ones being Vaibhavi Lakshmi, Money Circulation Scheme, Golden Chain, Dhan Varsha, Kuber and Diamond Circle. And what he used to do was obviously he promised a high rate of return and the initial investors were appointed as agents with a promise of 2% commission on their investment. And the commission was to be passed on when the agent brought in two or more investors. So the new investors were again appointed as agents. And so the cycle went on. Now, obviously, Sheregar did not have a business model or anything in place. He was just, you know, raising money and the money coming in from the latter investors was being used to pay off the former ones. And obviously, as long as the money coming in was more than the money going out, the schemes ran and then they collapsed. Now, in case of Sheregar, you know, it was a blatant Ponzi scheme where he did not have even a semblance of a business model in place. But normally that is not the case. You know, all Ponzi schemes have, not all, but a lot of Ponzi schemes have some sort of a business model in place, or at least they try to sort of show that they have a business model."

        "message": "So I don't know if you remember that, you know, in the 90s, there was this boom of plantation companies. And the most famous of the lot was this one called Anubhav Plantations run by a gentleman called C. Natesan. Now in one of his schemes for a deposit of rupees 6000, the investor was promised a piece of land measuring 300 square feet, with three teak saplings planted on it. Now, and this is a fairly elaborate, you know, business model. For 20 years, Anubhav would be the caretaker of the land and the trees. In the first six years, the investor would get rupees 1000 back every year. So at the end of, let's say, six years, his money that he had invested would already come back to him. And a 1000 rupee return on a 6000 rupee investment is pretty high. I mean, it's almost 16-17% per year, I mean, that's not a bad return at all. Added amounts of rupees 6000 and 12000 would be returned to the investor at the end of the sixth year and the twelfth year. When the scheme ended at the end of the 20th year, the investor got either rupees 3 lakhs or 40 cubic feet of teak. Now, the assumption was that each of the three teak trees would yield a volume of 1.13 cubic meters and each cubic meter of wood would be sold at rupees 88,286. Now, I mean, this assumption was unrealistic and it never worked. And obviously, what Natesan was doing was he was taking the money being brought in by the older and newer investors and paying off the older investors. So a lot of these schemes have a great, I mean, what looks like a business model in place. And this is something that has sort of, you know, gone on forever. I mean, if you look at some of the newer Ponzi schemes also, you know, a few years back, there was this scheme that came into light called the Stock Guru. So Stock Guru had a very simple business model. They promised returns as high as 20% per month on the basis of, you know, buying stocks at a low price and selling them at a high price. But 20% return per month, obviously not possible and not possible, I mean, it may be possible in an odd month here and there, but it's not something that you can guarantee. Now, obviously, what they were doing was, you know, moving money. And apparently, and, you know, after a point of time, the scheme collapsed. So yes, I mean, so most Ponzi schemes have a legitimate business model in place. Also, you know... As in they promise what appears to be a legitimate business model. Yeah, so it promises, it appears to be a genuine investment opportunity. So another great example here, and again, I mean, I'm using all these 90s examples, because, you know, when I wrote the paper, you know, we had only the 90s examples, right? So this was written largely in, I think, 2002-2003. So I don't know how many people would remember, in some time in the late 1990s, there was this company called Home Trade, which advertised extensively. They had Hrithik Roshan, Sachin Tendulkar and Shah Rukh Khan. I mean, maybe it was not even late 90s, it was probably early 2000s, because Kahona Pyaar Hai came only in the year 2000. So anyway, the dates here are, I mean, we can all Google the dates. So Home Trade essentially had a, again, you know, sort of a business model where they took money from cooperative banks, based in Maharashtra, and a provident fund called the Seaman's Provident Fund for investing in short dated government securities. So again, you know, some semblance of a business model. The problem was, in most cases, no investment was made. And when the investment was made, these securities were pledged as collateral to raise more money. And the money would then be diverted into stock market financing, where higher returns could be earned, at least, you know, the hope was. Now, when a bank inquired about the securities, Home Trade would reply that the securities had gone to RBI for clearance. I mean, during those days, things used to work manually. And doing this, Home Trade bought itself time of around six to eight weeks. On the date of maturity, you know, when the security had to be redeemed, Home Trade had not invested, you know, or it had diverted money into the stock market. So what they would do is they would go to another cooperative bank, raise money from them, and pay off the first one. And this is how the story went. And, you know, and we used to sort of wonder as to, you know, what had Sachin and Hrithik and Shah Rukh got to do with the entire, you know, company, because nobody really understood at least in the public domain as to what, you know, the company actually did. So it's just that these brand ambassadors provided that legitimacy to the company, you know, and then people went in. So these ads were basically meant for all these cooperative banks to impress them. Hey, boss, you know, we are paying these guys. So you know, you can lend us the money. I mean, so the point here is that a lot of Ponzi schemes have big brand ambassadors. So the best example here is, and I mean, I hope both of us don't get sued, is that of Sahara. Sahara used the Indian cricket team as their brand ambassador, I mean, for a very, very long time. I mean, they also sponsored the hockey team. Now, obviously, when a normal guy who is depositing money with Sahara, I mean, whatever, you know, the 50 rupees or the 100 rupees or whatever he, you know, deposits daily, he looks at the fact that these guys are sponsoring the Indian cricket team. I mean, there is no bigger brand in India than the Indian cricket team, right, at least much through the 90s and the early 2000s. I mean, now we can debate because there are badminton stars and yeah, but I like cricketers"

        "message": "So when you have the cricket team, sort of wearing the logo, wearing a company's logo, obviously, people, you know, will give it money very, very easily. Now, the problem was, Sahara also was in multiple businesses all over the place. But you know, whether these businesses were making money, no one really knew. The core business was chit funds, basically. But it wasn't, I mean, once upon a time, that is how they started. What are chit funds? Are they Ponzi schemes? No, they're not. So I'll explain what are chit funds. So chit funds are essentially, you know, you know, what kitty parties are, right? Yeah. Okay, so they're basically kitty parties with a twist. Okay. Now, what happens in a kitty party is that, you know, women come together, and they contribute a given amount of money every month. And then a chit is sort of, you know, selected, and, you know, the name, you know, who are the woman is whose name is on the on the chit gets all the money contributed in that month. So let's say, there are 12 women, and they get 10 bucks each, 5000, 10 bucks, an illustration of example, so there are, let's say, 12 women, and they give a lakh each 5000, 5000, so 5000, and they meet once a month. So when they pool the money together, it works out to a total of 60,000 rupees, 12 names are written on a chit on sheets of paper from these chits, one chit is drawn, and the woman whose name is on the chit gets the rupees 60,000. Okay, as simple as that. Now, when they meet next month, 11 months, 11 names are written on the chits, one name is drawn, and that woman gets the money, then when they meet again, then 10 names are written, and so the cycle works. So, so eventually, you know, there is one woman left who in the last month gets the 60,000 rupees. So basically, what is happening here is that, you know, every month by putting in 5000 rupees every month, you get 60,000 bucks at one go, and you can then do something substantial with it, right? Now, of course, the problem here is that, you know, some women might drop out, some may not be able to pay. So someone who's already got the money may not pay. So I mean, there's nothing, you know, that stops people from doing it. Now, a chit fund actually works slightly differently. Now, again, let's assume that there are 12 women, and they contribute 5000. So this means a total of 60,000 has been collected every month. Then what happens is that the amount that is collected is auctioned to the 12 members after a minimum discount has been set. Now, what does that mean? So let's say the minimum discount is 5000 rupees. This means that the maximum amount any woman can get from the total rupees 60,000 collected is rupees 55,000, okay? After these discount bids are invited, all the women bid. Now, let's say one woman bids a discount of rupees 12,000. So this is the highest discount that has been bid and hence she gets the money. So since the agreed on discount is 12,000, she would get rupees 48,000. But then there are some, you know, other organizing charges, etc, etc. So typically, she would get something like a 45,000 rupees. Okay, now, the discount of 12,000 is basically the profit that the group as a whole has made. And then it's divided, you know, 12,000 divided by 12. So 1000 rupees goes to every member. So now, of course, the woman who got the 45,000 rupees will now keep contributing, you know, 5000 rupees every month for the remaining 11 months and in every month, there will be a sort of an auction and the woman who sort of offers the maximum discount will get the money. So this is how a chit fund is supposed to work. So chit funds are not Ponzi schemes. But what happens is, a lot of people who because chit funds are in the imagination of people. So a lot of people who run Ponzi schemes, call their investment schemes as chit funds. So which is why chit funds have got a bad name. I mean, if you look at a state like, you know, what used to be erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and now is Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, there are lots of big chit funds that are run in that state and they have been around for a while now. So in a way, you know, a lot of Ponzi schemes have spoiled the, the name of chit funds. So, so it's not all chit funds are not Ponzi schemes. But Ponzi schemes are run in the name of running a chit fund very often."

And excellent book, which I would recommend and which also has one interesting element of every Ponzi scheme, which is that once people get there, once the first batch of investors when they get their interest for the first time, number one, what they tend to do is they tend to reinvest it immediately, because they are obviously greedy. So you don't even have to pay out the entire batch of first investors. And secondly, once they actually get the money, like you've put 100 bucks and got 150 bucks in 45 days, you become a hardcore evangelist for the company, you tell all your friends, you tell your relatives, you sell your house and put that money in. And it's just one thing upon another, which is, you know, and towards the end of this episode, we'll kind of discuss human nature also and why we as a species are particularly prone to such frauds. I mean, other animals eat, you know, the fellow members of the species, but they don't cheat them in this way. And one angle I'd also like you to expand upon is a multilevel marketing, the MLM angle. Because, you know, one of the things that you mentioned, which was true of Ponzi also, which is true of say, Sharagar, what you were saying, is that he turned his early investors"

        "message": "So multilevel marketing now, in case of Ashok Sharagar, he was just getting agents. Now, if let's say he had a product attached to the entire thing, let's say, you know, every agent had to sell a bar of soap for 100 bucks, something, you know, some special bar of soap. Now, that would have given him a legitimate purpose, right? So if you look at a lot of multilevel marketing schemes, I mean, even though they sort of come attached with a product which needs to be sold, the money actually is made in getting more and more members. Even those, you know, if you look at even, you know, I mean, legitimate MLM schemes, you know, the money is basically made by getting more and more members and then selling them those products, right? Now, the problem here is that if you do not enter the MLM scheme at a higher level, and if you enter it at a lower level, I mean, by then it's too late to make any money irrespective of whether you're in a legitimate scheme or you're in an illegitimate scheme. Now, you know, if you're in an illegitimate MLM, if you're in what is an outer Ponzi scheme, I mean, you need to take into account the level that you're entering it at, but then how do you figure that out? There is no way of doing that, right? So the point I'm trying to make here is that if a Ponzi scheme becomes too big, it collapses under its own weight, okay? So let me just give you a very simple example here. Let's say someone starts a Ponzi scheme, okay? He gets 100 members and each member is supposed to contribute 10,000 rupees and is promised a return of 50,000 rupees at the end of one year, okay? Now, if every investor who's promised, I mean, if the guy sort of doesn't want to run away with the money at the very beginning and wants to sort of be in business at the end of one year. So every investor who's paid 10,000 needs to be paid 50,000 rupees, okay? Now so for every investor who has to be paid off, the guy needs five new investors to come in. So for five new investors, he needs 500 investors, okay? Because then the money will balance itself out. Now let's say at the end of second year, he wants to continue going again. So for 500 investors, he needs 2,500 investors. Then for 2,500, he needs 12,500. Now by the time you reach the ninth level, the number goes up to something like 19.6 crore or some very big number, right? So that is not, I mean, you know, to get so many people involved is simply not possible. So which is why, you know, eventually all Ponzi schemes collapse under their own weight. And which is why even in an MLM scheme, if you are even in a legitimate MLM scheme, where you actually make money by selling products, if you're entering it like too late, there is no way you can, you can only buy products beyond a point everyone else around you would already be an agent, and they would already be buying products of the company, which is something which happened to Amway in a very big way, you know, people who entered it in the early stages made a lot of money, but by, you know, by the time it actually picked up and the general janta got in, you know, you had some five Amway agents."

And when the financial crisis stuck, it just became very, very difficult to continue rotating money because prices of everything sort of fell.

So yeah, which is so even even closer to home, I mean, I mean, they were West Bengal in the last decade has had their fair share of Ponzi schemes. And I remember one of my father's friends, you know, called when when when when I think Sarada was the scheme which went bust, he called up and said, Hey, you know, I lost so much money. And it's not like, you know, only the uneducated lot, even the educated lot puts money into these schemes, and then they lose. So in fact, the Sarada case is also very interesting that they really cashed in on the celebrity part of the Ponzi scheme to make themselves, you know, sound legitimate. So I just like to sort of read out something here. So Sarada, you know, was run by a gentleman called Sudipta Sen, okay, Sudipta Sen, Sudipta Sen. Okay, if you were to pronounce it in the proper Bengali way, Sudipta Sen, okay. So Sudipta Sen ensured that the Sarada group had huge presence in the media. I'm quoting the business standard here, which says his first entry into the space was through Channel 10. And thereafter, he expanded into Dailies, The Bengal Post, if you remember that newspaper, and Sakaalvela, which obviously means the afternoon. In 2010, Sen bought out Tara Channels as well. At the time of closing down, the group had 10 media outfits, news TV channels, newspapers and magazines. Now, this gave a lot of credibility and helped building the brand. The cine actor Mithun Chakraborty was the brand ambassador for Channel 10. The Trinamool party was also seen being close to the group. Now, this is again a Sarada agent called Reba Mitra, you know, telling NDTV.com when the scam sort of came to the fore. We put our faith in Sarada because big leaders of the Trinamool like Madan Mitra, Didi, the Chief Minister, Kunal Ghosh, Shatabdi Roy, Mithun Chakraborty, when these big people are with them, government people, then would this money be stolen from us? Now, I mean, this is a very, you know, this is how the entire scheme got its legitimacy. And you know, the interesting thing is the, the kind of returns that all these schemes, you know, offer. Sarada was offering returns of anywhere between 17.5 to 22%, so, which is something that sort of, you know, attracted a lot of people to, you know, put money there. You know, another interesting scheme that, you know, I would like to talk about, and this is also a recent one, is called PACL. Okay. Now, this was big in and around, you know, Delhi and North India until, you know, the Securities Exchange Board of India cracked down on it, and the scheme had managed to sort of, you know, raise as much as 50,000 crore from people. Now, they also had, you know, their business model was very interesting, so-called, not the, I mean, there was no business model actually. So it told people that they were actually buying rights to a plot of land when they deposited money with the company. Now, when they wanted the money back, the company would sell the land, but apart from this underlying fiction, it worked very much like you could walk in and deposit money for"

So you do actually end up getting some of your money back, like in the original, like in the Charles Ponzi scheme, for example, I think people got about 27 out of every hundred dollars I haven't heard of anything in India, of course, in what's also interesting in India is that all the examples we've discussed are Ponzi schemes done by private parties, where it is willing individuals who even if they are fooled, at least voluntarily part with their hard earned money, even if they're fooled on false premises, and obviously the organizers of those fraud should go to jail.

Ponzi scheme around cows. Don't go there. So, so this was one interesting scheme that I remember. Another interesting scheme was something called Speak Asia. I mean, a lot of people would remember it. Now, so basically, Speak Asia had a very, again, it had a business model. And the model was that in order to become a member of Speak Asia, you had to invest 11,000 rupees. The investment was for subscribing to the electronic magazine issued by the company called Surveys Today. Now, this allowed the member to participate in two online surveys every week and make rupees 500 per survey or rupees 1000 per week. This when converted into an yearly number came to 52,000 rupees. So the an investment of 11,000 rupees gave you 52,000 at the end of the year. So which is a return of 373% in one year, not bad at all. Now, obviously, you know, there were no surveys or even if they were, they were, they were not as many as were required to sort of generate the return that the company had promised. So ultimately, the scheme collapsed. Now, in my particular case, you know, the reason I remember this very well is that at that particular point of time, I used to work for a weekly personal finance newspaper. And Speak Asia had a half page ad in it. So you know, imagine a Ponzi scheme being advertised in a personal finance newspaper. I mean, Speak Asia had ads all over the place. Yeah, it wasn't just just that, just that newspaper, the ads were published in but including that newspaper. So another interesting scheme that I remember is is was a Russian Ponzi scheme called MMM, which finally came to India as well. And they you know, where they were the most blatant of the lot in the sense that they offered to grow an initial investment of rupees 5000 to rupees 3.4 crore at the end of I mean, and there were some and when I wrote pieces against that Ponzi scheme, there were people who got back to me in order to tell me that, you know, I didn't understand the business model. So it happens every time, you know, this is a standard response when you write on a Ponzi scheme, people write back to you that, you know, you don't know anything about this. So you should shut up and keep your theory with you, because we are actually making money. And that's the best part, you know, as we discussed, the initial guys always make money and then they become, you know, evangelists for the company and go around telling people that boss, I have made money, this is safe. And you know, you can also invest in it."

Now, the way it works is very, very interesting. So all this money essentially is collected, and it comes under the National Small Savings Fund. And what happens is, so let's say, in a given year, 1,50,000 crore is the money coming into these schemes. Okay. And in that year, if 50,000 crore is to be redeemed, then 50,000 crore is taken from that 1,50,000 crore and redeemed. And the remaining 1,00,000 crore is a revenue in the annual budget of the Indian government. Okay. So, so what is happening here is as long as the money that keeps coming into these schemes is higher than the money that needs to be paid off to the investors whose investment is maturing, you know, the scheme will keep running. So it has a structure of a Ponzi scheme wherein new money is being used to pay off the investment"

But then what if you know what it is invested in, you will not, you know, it will screw you up even further. So the NSS of money right now, a lot of it is has been lent to the Food Corporation of India. Okay. Because what happens is now, so Food Corporation of India buys, and this is something we've discussed before, buys rice and wheat primarily directly from the farmers. Of late it's also bought pulses and oilseeds. Now it buys rice and wheat at a certain rate, but it sells them at a very, very low rate through the public distribution system, through the ration shops in order to fulfill the terms and conditions under the Food Securities Act. So obviously the difference is huge and this difference has to be refunded to the Food Corporation of India because otherwise, you know, the institution will collapse. And so what happens is that in every budget, the government has allocations towards food subsidy and a lot of this food subsidy allocation goes to compensate the Food Corporation of India. But in the recent years, what has happened is that the Food Corporation of India is not being refunded totally. So as of March 2019, the money that the government owed the Food Corporation of India was more than 1,60,000 crore. Now if this is the case, you know, so if the government is not repaying the Food Corporation of India, the Food Corporation of India has to borrow that money from somewhere in order to continue to be in business. So of the 1,60,000 crore, close to more than 90,000 crore, I think 94,000 crore, if I remember the number correctly, has been borrowed from the National Small Savings Fund. Now why has it been borrowed from the National Small Savings Fund is because if they were to sort of borrow that money, you know, from the normal banking channels, then they would crowd out the private borrowers and then interest rates would go up even further. So it's a huge, huge mess. I mean, if you start digging into the accounts of the government, it's just bizarre beyond a point. So this is a I mean, so this is one example, this is one example of how a Ponzi schemes being run within the government. The other thing is, as we talked about the entire idea of a fiscal deficit of a perpetual fiscal deficit is nothing but a Ponzi scheme, I mean, if you if you look at it, now, I mean, any government, most governments across, you know, across the world, and this includes central and state governments, run a fiscal deficit, which basically means they don't earn as much as they spend. Now, in order to finance that fiscal deficit, they need to borrow money, okay, and they borrow money. And this fiscal deficit continues. So basically, what is happening here is that at any given point of time, if the money that has been borrowed by the government has to be repaid, how is it being repaid? It is being repaid by borrowing more money, okay. Now, how does the government borrow money, it borrows money by selling government securities, right. So these securities are sold, and the money comes in and it is used to pay off the government securities which are maturing. Okay, now these new securities when their time to you know, comes when they are to mature, then the government borrows more money and repays this. And so the so the structure goes now, the thing here is this can only happen if the government is borrowing money in its own currency. Okay. Now, if you look at a lot of South American countries, they end up borrowing in dollars. Because you know, borrowing in dollar is cheaper than borrowing in your local currency. But the problem there is then, in order to repay those dollars, you need to earn those dollars as well. And in many cases, they don't have they are unable to earn those dollars. And then finally, they just default. So which is not going to happen in the Indian case, because the Indian government at least up until now borrows majorly in rupees."

And it's a future poor, who are therefore paying for your profligacy today. In either way, this is sort of a Ponzi scheme through time where effectively and this is one of the classic criticisms of the Social Security in America, where you are basically borrowing from future generations to spend on current ones, and which is expected to be a crisis when for example, the baby boomers reach retirement age, and you know, at some point in time, that scheme is expected to inevitably fall apart unless reformed drastically"

If you speak to any corporate economist, he will tell you that the interest rates on small savings schemes need to come down, because they are higher than bank deposits. And in order to compete with small savings schemes, banks need to offer a higher rate of interest. And because banks are offering a higher rate of interest on the deposits, they need to charge a higher rate of interest on their loans. Now, the reason that, you know, interest on small savings schemes cannot come down dramatically is because the government wants money to keep coming into these schemes, because if money doesn't come into these schemes, how are they going to pay for all the you know, money which is maturing all the investment which is maturing. So which is why the rate of interest on on on on small savings schemes will always be higher than rate of interest on fixed deposits, because otherwise the entire Ponzi structure will collapse. Now, if the Ponzi structure collapses for a private guy, he can just run, but for a government, the government cannot run, right, the government will have to still pay all the money which is maturing, which will come from taxpayers, which will then have to come from, you know, other parts of the budget, which basically, and when it comes from the other parts of the budget, then the problem is that you have to cut expenditure somewhere else or raise taxes. So which is, you know, one part. The other interesting thing is, you know, is what economists call financial repression. Now, financial repression in the Indian context is forcing banks to buy government securities. So by law, banks have to invest a certain percentage of their deposits in government securities. I think as of now, it's around 18.75%. But banks on their own, I think, would probably have invested more than 25% of their money in government securities. Now what this does is that it allows the government access to money, I mean, this is money which has to come into government securities, I mean, the same is the case with insurance companies where a certain proportion of, you know, money raised has to be compulsorily invested in government securities. So what this does is it keeps the interest rates lower than they actually would have been if the government did not force these institutions to buy government securities."

And so obviously, he calls them naturally occurring Ponzi schemes because they happen without the contravents of a fraudulent manager. And so what he essentially says is, and I'm paraphrasing here, when speculative prices in the stock market, I mean, share prices go up, creating successes for some investors. This may attract public attention, promote word of mouth enthusiasm and heighten expectations for further price increases. The stock market is the best example. Stories about stock markets going up spread very fast. Investors in an optimistic mood might want to buy stock and take the stock price further up. This leads to more investors entering the market, fueling an even greater price rise and the cycle gets repeated over and over again. As Shiller writes, when prices go up a number of times, investors are rewarded by price movements in these markets, just as they are in Ponzi schemes, OK? Now, the high prices are not sustainable since they are driven by unrealistic expectations of further price increases. The bubble eventually bursts and price crashes. Now, I mean, this works in, you know, so many different cases. I mean, you look at the entire, you know, the Modi bull run, the so-called Modi bull run, which has been on since September 2013. I mean, you know, stock brokerages have essentially been driving this story over and over again in various forms. But ultimately, the earnings of the companies haven't caught on to the price increases. So it's just the money that keeps coming in, which, you know, which drives up the prices, making it a beautiful example of a naturally occurring Ponzi scheme. Or if you look at real estate, I mean, the rally between almost 2002, 2003 to 2011, 12, 13, I mean, people used to just, you know, blindly invest in real estate because a whole generation had seen just prices going up. But beyond a point, you know, the prices reached a stage where it wasn't just, I mean, prices were going up not because there was genuine demand for these homes. They were going up because there were these investors who had money and they were buying and flipping. And ultimately, you know, even that game stopped. And if you look at how, you know, real estate has gone in the last five, six years, it's it's by, you know, it's by and large been a mess, primarily because the prices reached a stage where they just became unsustainable and, and prices continue to remain high, which"

But when it goes above that, it's basically investors are then buying it expecting it to rise further, which brings a greater fool theory into play, because they are buying at a high price, but they don't care that it's too high, because you know, someone will buy it for higher, which is again a classic case of a later investor paying off an earlier investment. And this continues to a point where because of all kinds of reasons, maybe the internal logic breaks down, or external events cause a crash, where it all kinds of falls apart. And the last guy left holding the can goes down. But as you know, Chuck Prince, who was then head of Citibank famously said in 2007, when he was asked about this about, you know, why do you keep participating in a bubble and Prince said, quote, as long as the music's playing, you have to dance, stop, quote, and, and that's often what happens. So, all these people participating in this Ponzi scheme of stock market bubbles or real estate bubbles aren't necessarily fools, they're behaving rationally, because they see the high probability of a greater fool along the road, so that they can make a profit."

They've been described beautifully in this book, written by Charles Mackey, which was published in 1841, Madness of Crowds, Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. It's, I mean, highly recommended not, you know, if you read it, not every chapter will be interesting. But some of the chapters are very, very interesting. And it's freely available on the link all these books we mentioned from the show notes. So in this book, you know, he describes the tulip mania in Holland, in the 1630s. The first account of tulips in Europe is from 1559, when a collector of exotic flora, Counsellor Hermat, received a consignment of tulip bulbs from a friend in Constantinople, which is now Istanbul, which he planted in his garden in Germany. His tulips drew a good deal of attention. In the following years, this flower became more and more popular among the upper classes, particularly in Germany and Holland, where it became a custom to order bulbs at an exorbitant price directly from Constantinople. Up to 1634, this custom became increasingly common, and from that, affluent society in Holland considered a lack of tulip collection to be of poor taste. So you need to have tulips in your house. Year after year, tulip prices rose, finally reaching astronomical heights. By 1636, the demand for tulip bulbs had risen drastically, and people started to trade them in exchanges across many towns in Holland. Tulips were bought by well-to-do collectors as well as by agents and speculators. At the smallest price drop, they would buy only to sell it later at a profit. Many individuals suddenly grew rich. A golden bait hung tempting out before the people. One after the other, they rushed into tulip markets like flies around a honeypot. At last, however, the more prudent ones began to see the folly that this could not last forever. Rich people no longer bought the flowers to keep them in their gardens, but to sell them again at a profit. It was seen that somebody must lose fearfully in the end. As this conviction spread, prices fell and never rose again. Now, you know, so this is how the Dutch tulip bubble played out. In fact, the tulip bubble is still playing out very well for Holland. I mean, you know, people from all over the world go there to see the tulips."

        "message": "Can you elaborate on that a bit? So this is, you know, more we're talking more in terms of structure, rather than, you know, there's no fraud element here. So I mean, if you look at the US dollar, now, the way the global financial system evolved post 1945, the dollar came to be at the heart of it. And you know, this obviously started at the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire in July 1944, where it was decided that, you know, the dollar would be one currency which would continue to be convertible into gold. Now, because of this, what happened was that countries started having their reserves, their international reserves in dollars, because dollar was the only currency convertible into gold. Before that, they used to have, you know, their reserves in the British pound because pound was also convertible into gold, but post the Second World War, because America had most of the monetary gold in the world, it sort of became came at the heart of the global financial system. Now, what has happened is because the you know, of this over the years, the much of the international trade has also moved to dollars, before that it was sort of split between you know, pound and dollar and so on, and so on and so forth. Now, now let's take the case of when I'm talking very simple terms here, let's take the case of United States and China. Now, the US is a net importer from China, it buys a lot of goods produced in China. Now, China obviously gets paid in dollars. Now, when a Chinese exporter gets these dollars back into China, he has to convert them into Yuan. And when he converts them into, he has to convert them into Yuan, because his expenses, his reporting everything is in Yuan. So these dollars then land up at as foreign exchange reserves at the People's Bank of China, which is the Chinese Central Bank. Now, these dollars can, you know, either continue remaining in the remaining with the People's Bank of China, or they can be invested somewhere. So then they are invested, the dollars are invested in American government securities. Now, because China earns, you know, so many, you know, a lot of dollars, a lot of dollars, more than a trillion dollars have been invested in American government securities. The same is the case with Japan, Japan has also invested more than a trillion dollars. So because so much foreign money comes into US government securities, the interest rates that the US government needs to offer on those securities becomes very low, because you know, the demand is huge. Now, when the interest rate that the US government is paying on its bonds is low, that becomes a benchmark for the overall interest rate scenario in the US, which is also low. So at lower interest rates, you know, people can borrow and buy stuff. And a lot of this stuff that gets bought is made in China. And because of this, you know, dollars which come back into the US in and get invested in US government treasuries ensure that interest rates are low, and consumer demand is high. And because of this Chinese companies benefit and more dollars go into China. And then these dollars are converted into Yuan, and then find their way back into the US government treasury securities, and again, ensure that interest rates continue to remain low. So there is a there is a cycle, there is a structure to it, where money goes from the US to China and comes back to the US and in the process ensures lower interest rates. It also ensures that the world continues the world trading system, so to say continues to be on the US dollar, right? I mean, it gives us an exorbitant privilege where in every country in the world needs to earn these dollars, the US can simply print it. Now, Donald Trump has this thing in his head that in order to make America great again, he has, you know, American imports have to come down, and exports have to go up."

And this essentially ensures that the interest rates in US continue to remain low. Now, there is a global trade war on currently with and Trump is making it more and more difficult for Americans to import goods from China. Okay. Now, if America doesn't import goods from China, then China doesn't earn those dollars, right. So one impact of that is that those dollars then again, don't find their way back into America. The other impact is that if China doesn't own on those dollars, it also doesn't earn money to buy stuff from other countries. So if it had earned that money, and it had bought stuff from other countries, those dollars would also eventually find its way back into America and ensure lower interest rates. So Trump is essentially attacking his own people, his own people in and he's attacking a system which has helped the US and which has helped the dollar continue to be at the heart of the global financial system. So so and in a way, you know, he's he's essentially trying to break the Ponzi structure. But you know, if and when and if it if he is successful at doing it, it will eventually end up hurting Americans because all these dollars will not come back to America, interest rates can go up. And if interest rates go up the entire, you know, the consumption culture on which essentially, you know, which is the great big American dream, will will sort of virtuous cycle becomes a vicious cycle. So this is another, you know, the, I mean, this in this case, the irony is that the the Ponzi structure, as it has evolved, is essentially benefiting the US and what I mean, this is one positive application of the positive application of a Ponzi because you know, we and this is especially for all those people on the social media who want us to, you know, talk about good things in life.

So there's a beautiful quote in Robert Schiller's book, Irrational Exuberance, and this is how it goes. A fundamental observation about human society is that people who communicate regularly with one another think similarly. There is at any place and in any time a zeitgeist, a spirit of times. So what happens is if a person wants to invest, the chances are that he will look around to see what his friends, family, etc., etc., are doing with their money. And when they see that the friends, etc., are investing in a particular scheme where they have made money, so they automatically sort of end up investing there because the assumption is that, okay, this guy I know and he's made his money, so it should generally be safe. People don't go inquiring about it. And this is true about not just Ponzi schemes, it's true about, I mean, look at why people buy LIC policies, I mean, they buy LIC policies because, you know, the guy selling them the policy is known to them, he's a relative, or they've seen people all around them buy LIC policies."

So this is something that we've written, and it's like the desire to conform to the behavior and opinions of others is a fundamental human trait, an accepted principle of psychology. If the people around the potential investor invest in a certain way, they might be a tendency for him to follow them, much like the circular mill of ants, okay, the mill is created when an army of ants find themselves separated from the colony. Once they're lost, they obey a simple rule, follow an ant in front of you. So decisions of investors, much like the circular mills of ants, are not made at the same time, but in a sequence. So people who invest in a Ponzi scheme assume that the scheme is a good bet, simply because some of the people they know have already invested in it.

But then obviously, you know, there is first, as I said, is the herd mentality and then there is greed because, you know, you see that you compare the rate of returns on other investment which is available. And in this case, as I said, the returns available, returns which are offered on Ponzi schemes are generally significantly higher than the other schemes available in the market. So let me just give you a few schemes and then the kind of returns that they offered. So there was a Rose Valley Ponzi scheme in West Bengal a few years back that offered anywhere between 11.2 percent to 17.7 percent. PSCL offered 12.5 to 14 percent. Sarda reportedly offered returns on 17.5 to 22 percent. So and I mean, we've already seen the returns on offer in case of Speak Asia and MMM, you know, where a 5000 rupee investment was supposed to sort of become 3.4 crore at the end of the year. So basically, you know, with good advertising and stories of previous investors, as I said, you know, who made a killing by investing in the scheme, investors get caught in the euphoria that is generated and hand over their hard-earned money, much against going against common sense. And, you know, I'd like to quote this economic historian called Charles Kindleberger here. And this is what he said, there is nothing so disturbing to one's well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich. So again, I mean, it's basically boils down to herd mentality and the fear of missing out. And overconfidence and over-optimism also have a role to play. As you said that, you know, once you are invested into something, you tend to rationalize that because I'm already in it, this is going to work out right, which may or may not. Then there is the contrast effect, wherein you compare with all the other available options and see that this is the best option going around. Mental accounting also plays a role.

So I always wanted to plant trees. As a child, I used to feel sad seeing trees burned down in my village in Tirunelveli. Now, again, I mean, and then, I mean, we all remember Harshad Mehta, right?

They don't have the cognitive bandwidth to take decisions on complex subjects like where should they invest their money and so on. My advice to people, for example, about the stock market always is and I think you'd agree with me is that unless you have studied it in great depth, don't invest in the stock market at all. Because otherwise, you're one of the suckers like in poker, they say if you don't know who's the sucker at the table, it's you. But the thing is, most people now don't have the time to get that kind of detailed knowledge. They rely on all of these instincts, which you earlier mentioned, look around you what are successful people apparently doing, there is, you know, the FOMO effect comes into play and so on and so forth. So now if someone is to ask you that, listen, yeah, Vivek, I have a, I spend all my time and all my mental energy on making a living at whatever I do now, when I look to invest or when these kinds of opportunities come up, what are the heuristics, which I should apply to make sure that I am not being fooled? You know, what are the kinds of heuristics which I can look at? And I'll take a short at, you know, two quick answers which come to my mind, and then you can elaborate and give more of your own. And one of them is, there is no such thing as a free lunch. If someone is offering you, for example, far greater rate of returns and everybody else in the market, they must, you know, it fails a smell test, ask yourself, why that would be. And the other heuristic I'd offer is that, again, it's a cliche, if it feels too good to be true, it probably is, you know, these are my two heuristics that I would offer what"

So the moment anyone other than a bank, okay, guarantees you a rate of return, you know you're being fooled. I mean, it's very, very clear there. So you have to be careful about that. The second thing is also, you know, you look at the fact that if, let's say banks are offering a rate of interest of 7%, 6% or whatever, as they are right now. So in that market, if someone's offering you a return of, let's say, 15% or 20%, you know that there is something wrong there. Other than that, you know, so other than I think more than heuristics, you know, I have these 10 points, which I think are useful for anyone who wants to generally plan their personal finance.

So what it basically means is that if, okay, you don't want to do anything in the world, you want to just deposit money in a bank, please don't go and deposit all your money in one bank. I mean, that is by far the most stupid thing you can do. I mean, after that, you can't claim that you know, you are financially illiterate and you're not very sophisticated.

So satisficing is a portmanteau term, which is like, it's a combination of two existing words, satisfying, and sufficing. And the concept comes from the fact that decisions tire us out, every decision takes a certain amount of energy, leaving less energy for other decisions and indeed other work. So a lot of people fight this what is known as decision fatigue, by satisficing when it comes to purchases. So if you're doing a major purchase, like you're buying a house, obviously, you spend the time to research that. But if you're buying a phone, or if you're buying a book, or if you're buying, you know, any electronic implement, then you know, you know that all the brands and all the categories are more or less okay. So you satisfy, you satisfy yourself with the first one that appears to suffice. And it's called satisficing. And and in fact, decision fatigue is also a reason, for example, why people like Steve Jobs, and now Mark Zuckerberg, they dress the same way every day, it feels like a uniform"

I mean, other than, you know, I didn't put I didn't want to put the diversification point into this, because it's just very, very basic. Yeah. So if you can't even do that, then I mean, God help you. So if your family is dependent on you, buy a term insurance policy. If no one is dependent on you, you don't need insurance, okay? Stay away from investment plans, which pretend to be insurance, endowment, money back, you lips, life will be very simple. Buy a house if you're planning to live in it. Stay away from under construction properties as far as possible. Further, try to buy an apartment in a society where people are already living. So that if there is some, you know, bureaucratic or administrative problem, you're not the only one running around, when there are other people involved. And in India, it is very, very important because, you know, all societies have some lafda at the end of the day. Have a health insurance policy for your entire family. To meet emergencies, have some money in a bank account, which could meet expenses of three to six months, I mean, at the very basic. If you want the ability to make decisions that you feel are correct, at any point of time in your life, you need at least two years of expenses in the bank account. I mean, then you can, you know, ask your boss to fuck off and do what the right thing is, what you feel the right thing is. But without that, you can't. Have an SIP running on a few good equity mutual funds, review the performance once a year. Don't go looking at the returns every week, a lot of people do that. If not every week, at least they have a tendency to look at every month. There is good research that shows that people who look at their returns regularly tend to invest in equity for shorter terms than people who don't, and which basically means then you lose out on returns. After a certain age, make a will. Also make sure that when it comes to all your investments, nominations are in place. Because I mean, I have seen a few issues of where, you know, the husband has died and the wife has no idea where he had invested and, and it's too late to sort of start again from scratch. Make your tax saving investments at the beginning of the year, if you're investing in things like public provident fund, or do them through the year. If you're investing in things like let's say a tax saving mutual fund, don't wake up in the last week of the year to make your tax saving investment when you're more likely to be taken for a ride because you'll end up investing in anything, you know, anyone who basically comes to your house and just gets you to sign whatever paper they want to. Also be careful when you go to a bank for anything, because these days, they you know, the moment you enter a bank, they want to sell you things that you don't need. Make sure that you end up doing what you had gone there for, okay. So I mean, the example like I like to give here is that someone sold a pension plan to my father a few weeks before he was retiring, okay, so thankfully, I found out and you know, so all insurance policies, again, remember this all so called insurance policies have a 15 day look in period. So if you want, don't feel comfortable with it, you can go ahead and return it and get your money back. Also, finally, and you know, no one ever made money out of investing by watching TV channels. So you have to, you know, stay as far away from the CNBCs of the world if you really want to make any money in life. So these are I think, the 10 basic things, they're not very difficult, there is no rocket science involved here. And all of this can be easily executed."
