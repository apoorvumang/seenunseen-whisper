        "message": "Imagine if COVID-19 had hit the world a few centuries before it actually did. Before we knew what a virus was, or an ACE2 receptor was, or what natural selection was. A time when we couldn't treat any disease because we couldn't understand any disease. A time when people considered themselves lucky to live till 30. A time without ventilators or paracetamols. As it happens, imagining that isn't all that hard because we've seen that picture. The world has been struck by various pandemics in the past, and the accounts are horrific. Chinmay Tumbe mentioned them in his fine book, Age of Pandemics, which I discussed with him in an earlier episode. Writing about the plague in the 6th century, Chinmay wrote, The demographic devastation in the Mediterranean world was stark, with records in multiple languages describing how thousands of people died in a single day, or how, as per one traveler, corpses were lying in the fields and along the roadside and cattle wandering untended into the hills. The historian Procopius described how the bodies came so fast that those digging the trenches to bury them could not dig fast enough. What to do with the bodies? They climbed the towers of the fortifications where they were tore of the roofs and just piled in the bodies from there. When plague struck again in the 14th century, in what is known as the infamous Black Death, up to 50 million people are estimated to have died. That included 35-60% of Europe. Imagine that. Half the people around you just gone. As if it's the infinity wars. Well, you're listening to this episode in the middle of the second wave in India, and the world has been fighting COVID-19 for a year and still not won. And yet it could have been far worse. Here's the thing, our politicians have failed us, our bureaucrats have failed us, policy makers have failed us, the dysfunctional state stands exposed for what it is. And in so many different ways, we have failed each other. But science has not failed us this time. Unlike in pandemics of past times, we know what is happening. We know what we do not know about it. And we have made miraculous progress in coming up with the vaccines that we have. Is it enough? Of course not. As my guest on today's show says, vaccines aren't enough, you need vaccinations. If I may add to that, human knowledge is not enough. You need human action. There is a lot that is wrong with the world today. But there is also a lot that can give us hope. Science can give us hope."

        "message": "Please welcome your host, Amit Bhaluman. Welcome to the seen and the unseen. My guest for today is Anirban Mahapatra, a scientist, science writer, and editor who's just written a wonderful book called COVID-19, separating fact from fiction. I first discovered Anirban on Twitter during this pandemic. He tweets at the handle of at Bhalumanush and was one of the voices of reason during the last few months. His book is much needed because it explains a complex subject in simple language from first principles. For a layperson like me, it was a perfect way to go deep into the subject without having the sense that I had to work for it. Anirban explains science so well that at moments, I felt like a child again, discovering new and wonderful things in wide-eyed wonder. Now, this episode is actually like two episodes in one. In the first half, we speak of Anirban's journey in the state of modern science and academics and science writing and so on. In the second half, we speak about COVID-19 itself, what the virus is, what it does, and the different ways in which science is fighting it. I love both halves of this conversation and I hope you do as well. A quick note before we start, the day after I recorded this conversation, my father died of COVID-19. He'd been admitted to hospital for other issues a couple of weeks before that and was fading in different ways. He couldn't recognize me when I last met him. He picked up COVID at the hospital and spent a few days in a COVID ICU. We weren't allowed to meet him, obviously, but we were allowed one video call a day. In those calls, he was unable to speak and we don't even know if he was in his senses. And if he wasn't, that could have been a blessing because he was clearly in a lot of suffering. To be honest, I haven't processed this yet. It leads to bigger questions that no one can have an answer for. As Wittgenstein said, quote, what we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence. Stop quote. For everything else, though, there is science and rationality and those are what this episode celebrates. Before we get to this conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break. On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive some games. Well, if you want to be surrounded by beauty and you love fine art, I have a win-win proposition for you.

Yeah, you know, the last few months, of course, have been very tough for the world, very tough for all of us. If one is to look for silver linings, I think one of my silver linings is that I discovered your work on Twitter. I had no idea of anyone called Ad Bhalo Manoosh before, you know, COVID kind of stuck and you obviously very quickly became one of the soundest sources on what's really going on during this period of time. So now, you know, because I hardly know you at all, I just know you from your very scientific crisp factual tweets, I want to get to know a little more. So tell me, tell me, you know, a bit about your childhood, where did you grow up?"

        "message": "What was that like? Yeah. Okay, so where to start? I was, my parents were both physicians. I say were because my father passed away six years ago. And my father came from a very small village at the Bengal-Odisha border, and when we say to our children that we had to walk in the snow or so far to actually get to a school, in my father's case, he did have to walk from his village to get to his school. And from there, from that remote village where there was no electricity, there was no running water, he went to medical college, and then from there to he did his post graduation, he did his MD from Chandigarh, and then his DM from Ames. My mother went to Calcutta Medical College. And she from there, she also went to Ames, and they were both doctors there. So I was born at Ames in New Delhi. And after that, my father was in the United States by both my parents were in the US for some time. So I went to school there for a little bit, and I came back to India. And then my formative years were actually mostly in India. So I when I came back to India, I learned to read and write in Bangla, I learned to play cricket at a much later age than a lot of other people. And I went through school and then both my parents were like, okay, so we're doctors, it's basically almost inevitable that you will have to be a physician. But I figured out a little bit later on when I was with my father and sometimes even at night because he when he moved back, he moved back to a small tertiary district town and there weren't that many was a US trained board certified cardiologist and there weren't that many physicians there at that time. And so in the middle of the night, sometimes I would have to go with him with the ECG machine and help him with that. And I realized at that time that I was more into the research side of it, I wasn't going to be a very good clinician, I just did not have that in me. And the other thing I realized is I really loved biology. And one of the things is that if you look into any life form on the planet right now, because it's had 4 billion years of evolution, there are some remarkable things about it, we just have to keep looking and be curious about it. So I did my bachelor's degree and my master's degree in India. And I got a very nice fellowship, a university fellowship to study microbiology at the Ohio State University in the US. And I came over to the US. And I remember one of the first courses I took in the US. And I absolutely bombed it. And that's because I didn't know how to learn anything. I had gone through the Indian system of basically picking up a lot of facts and trying to crack exams. And so when I was taking this course, this was in the first semester, first quarter of my PhD, and the professors, each professor was coming in, and they would just be presenting a few papers of research relevant to their own work. I picked up all the facts in those papers. But when the exam actually came, they didn't ask any other facts, they wanted me to synthesize what was in those papers to be able to come up with completely independent and open-ended answers to questions that they had that were tangentially related to those papers. And I really did poorly in that first exam. But after that, I figured out that this is how I was, and this is what I was thinking all along is that I was always sort of a rebellious person who asked like, the how and the why. And this and so then I took like a duck to water after that. And I did better after that, I was very fortunate to be able to get into a lab at the time that they were doing really groundbreaking work. So the lab that I joined at Ohio State University, to do my PhD, they had at that time discovered a new amino acid. So typically, as as most even high school students will be able to tell you, folks who take biology that there are 20 amino acids that are inserted into proteins, and these are coded in the genetic code. There are a few cases of a 21st amino acid, which had been discovered in 1986. When I joined the lab in 2001, the lab I joined, they had to back to back, well, they had two science papers demonstrating the genetic encoding of the 22nd amino acid pyrolysine. And this was basically something that went into the textbooks, and it was discovered as being equivalent of discovering a new particle in physics. And that sort of appealed to me. And that has sort of been my driving interest in science, is that it is not static. All along, we have been reading these textbooks that everything is as it has been, nothing ever changes in science, the textbooks, the editions get updated, and we just memorize those facts. But there was a great time to be in that lab. And I joined that lab, I had some very amazing friends that I worked with in that lab, got a really great and challenging project. And the first paper, when we were getting it done, it was basically elucidating the process by which that amino acid gets inserted into specific proteins. And we did all the experiments, we knew there was another group working on it as well. And we sent it into science as well, because the earlier papers had been in science. And they rejected the paper. They said, they gave us a very short amount of time and said the paper is, it looks good, but it's basically they sent us a standard of form rejection letter. And so we send it around in nature, we're saying we're not going to try anywhere else, we have confidence in our work, we're going to stay up to the high standard of the work that we've done. And fortunately, they asked us to do a little bit more, we did a few additional experiments, but nature published it. And the funny thing is after when nature published that paper, science did a write up on that same paper that we had published. So that was a really great opportunity for me. And that discovery that we made has some real world applications as well. Scientists are using it, using that system as a tool to insert new amino acids with different structure and function as building blocks to increase the functional capability of different proteins right now. And so after that, I had a few more really good papers. And then when the time came around to complete my PhD, I was like, okay, I'm going to go the traditional route, I'm going to be a scientist. And I had a couple of very nice postdoc interviews done, I was ready to do a postdoc. And then all of a sudden, I saw this, this job ad for an assistant managing editor position for a newish scientific journal in the field of chemical biology, which is using the tools of chemistry and biochemistry to solve important problems in biology. And I looked at the job ad and it said, okay, at that time, it was like, I would be looking at all the manuscripts that would be coming into the journal, working with the scientific editors and deciding whether those manuscripts should go out to peer review, I would be writing summaries of papers, I would be going to meetings and commissioning work. And then we were also doing podcasts at that time, interviews with authors in the, well, I say we, so what happened is I ultimately did apply for it. And I did get the job and I joined there, that's a little over a decade ago. And that was a very thrilling and intellectually rewarding experience for me there. As I started on working on a newish journal, a journal that is now fairly well known and established and working with editors who were scientifically amazing and at the top of their individual disciplines, but were also very, very kind to this kid who had just come out of a lab and basically heard him out. So I do consider them my mentors. And so at that time I was working with some of my editors were Laura Kiesling, who's at MIT and is one of the leaders in chemical biology. Jennifer Doudna was one of the editors I worked with at that time, and she won the Nobel prize last year for her CRISPR-Cas system. She hadn't discovered CRISPR-Cas when I had joined. So I was actually, I know the history of that discovery and how that has moved on for genome editing and the potential that that definitely has. And so when I was working on that one journal, I got involved in launching other journals. And the way that came about is like, basically my organization said, you have all these ideas and we're looking to expand into new areas of science. Tell us about some of these ideas. And my first idea was we are looking at like multidisciplinary areas where we can bring together different scientists from different fields. And neuroscience is definitely one of the next frontiers. And so I, a little over a decade ago now, I helped propose, write up and launch a neuroscience journal that brought in some of the biology and the chemistry. And incidentally, I want to mention this because we were talking about COVID-19. One of the first descriptions or one of the first ideas of the loss of smell after COVID-19 was proposed by a couple of scientists based out of Pakistan who had written this perspective in a journal that I had launched. So I was very, very thrilled by that. And this happened early on, I think around February or March of 2020. And so after that, I haven't looked back. I have been involved in launching other journals as well. I've launched a synthetic biology journal. So synthetic biology is basically using the tools and techniques of, of engineering to biology and using cells as factories to produce products. So it's the, it's the next step of biotechnology. So I would say it's biotechnology 2.0 or 3.0. And so I helped launch that journal. I launched an infectious diseases journal. This was before the pandemic. And then I've moved on to other areas now where the portfolio of journals that I work with include climate change, sustainable chemistry, energy, and material science, physical chemistry, photonics. So I've moved. So one of the reasons I left the bench is because I was sort of very, very skilled and I knew a lot about one very specific area of science and I wanted to become more of a generalist. And I think that that happened over, over time. As you mentioned, most people on Twitter don't know anything, any of this, because I kept us very, very low profile and I didn't mix what I did at work with my tweets, which were sometimes just philosophical musings and sometimes my travel and, and, and my experiments and failed experiments in the kitchen."

        "message": "Wow. So there is so much to unpack there and so many strands and thank God I have a notebook. So I'm kind of taking notes of all the things I want to talk about. But the first thing that kind of intrigued me was the love for biology, because I don't come across too many people who say that they love biology as a kid. And this is obviously a function of the way that it's taught to us and all of that. And perhaps, you know, your parents being doctors might have helped and all of that. And you know, one of my sort of big complaints about our education system, not just here, but I think kind of everywhere is that, you know, many of the things we are taught, in fact, everything we are taught is potentially full of wonder. Like I think about this most in the context of mathematics, that it's taught in such boring, dull ways and people just turn away from it. But actually, it's like so integral to our lives and explain so much and it's not even, you know, difficult. And I can see sort of a similar process with biology and I was sort of intrigued when you said that when you kind of took the first exam and that you as because you were in that rote learning kind of frame of mind, it didn't quite work out. Some sort of wondering that, you know, this whole way of thinking like, like these days, whenever I learn something new, I just first try to go back to first principles. So in the sense, don't tell me the right way of doing anything, don't tell me the process by which one does something, I want to go back to first principles, think of it from there. And then I can work a lot of the stuff out. And then whatever I subsequently learn is kind of easy to understand. And it also strikes me that when I meet other people with this kind of approach, it strikes me that you can apply it to everything, right? And you've kind of spoken about how, you know, you begin in biology, but then you kind of spread out like this, you spoke about synthetic biology, where you're applying the principles of engineering to biology, which is fascinating to me, and you're bringing this other prism. And it seems to me that there is, you know, a certain kind of person who does this, who'll, you know, look at the first principles of everything, who'll, you know, and therefore for them, it's easy not to get trapped in the conventions of a particular field, but to go beyond and to, you know, apply other prisms, apply other methods, and it kind of broadens your thinking. And it also strikes me that many people, even many accomplished people sort of get trapped by the conventions of their sort of field. So now that you've taken this interesting journey, whereby the nature of your work starting journals in all these different fields, you are constantly one interacting with all of these people, and to also sort of expanding your own knowledge and all of that, what sort of your sense of the ecosystem out there, like, are there many thinkers like you or is it kind of an exception? Do you wish there were more people who took a broader view of the science and at the same time, a deeper view than, you know, might be the case? Because I certainly see that, you know, in fields that I know a little bit about, like economics or whatever, that there will be people who are, you know, extremely accomplished, but they're almost functioning within the bounds of what they have learned in an academic sense. And they're not just looking at the world around them and, you know, applying those principles to everything or taking insight from, you know, other methods."

        "message": "I think there are a lot of people who think like this, and I fervently believe that all children grow up like this, that when they are very young, maybe before they have it beaten out of them in school by teachers who say that this is the way that you have to do something, or do you know more than me, or you have to get good marks in an exam. I think even, and I really enjoy interacting with very young children. They ask some of the best questions, they do not have the same language. So you have to start from what you said, first principles, you cannot assume that they will understand the jargon. They do not take anything for granted, or they won't, I mean, it's a simple question of even asking, looking outside and saying, like, where did the moon come from? And we see it so often. But it's not a question and it's not a question that we should discard or, or why does time move in one direction is the things that after a certain amount of time, we start to take for granted. But I think all children have that sense of awe in that wonder. And I agree with you. I think children take to the basics of mathematics very, very early on, and then somehow because of the process of which it is taught that and, and some children are told that they are not good at it, and they have to do it a certain way that it just, it just gets lost and it just gets beaten out of them. But overall, I think that was one of the reasons why I wanted to write this book. And for me, that was one of the challenges of writing this book is, and writing for the public was, I will say, after having written perspectives, and editorials and papers for scientists, it was much harder because there is no common language, I cannot use the language, the terse, precise way of writing that goes into a paper and assume that the reader will be able to understand it. And so starting from first principle, and trying to develop a core set of ideas, was at least for me, one of the driving principles for for writing this book. But as people get into their own disciplines, I have also noticed this, this is also true of the various disciplines of biology or chemistry, they do not, there is very little crosstalk. And we do see it in in some other disciplines. And I think we did see a little bit of it during the pandemic with many people from various disciplines coming together. But even then, that's not always the case. We had, just to give you one very, very relevant example with these variants, you know, the first variant that came out of the UK was B.1.1.7. And at that point, when that first variant came out, the virologists are the people who are looking at the viruses and at sort of a virus level and molecular level and at an infectious level. The epidemiologists are looking at the spread and the trajectory of spread. The virologists were saying, okay, mutations happen all the time. Therefore, we do not think that this, this mutation is anything different, or that it spreads more. We have to show us in an animal model that this is, this is spreading more rapidly. And some virologists that I respect a lot, and have actually written textbooks at that point in early January, were not believing that this was a more infectious strain or variant of the virus. However, epidemiologists who have their own way of looking at data, and they were finding in the UK that this virus was actually now becoming more prevalent than the original strain, the lineage from Wuhan and the other mutant that was there, the B614G mutant, which was predominant at the time. And so that was sort of a different line of research, no less relevant, but it's just because of the individual aspects of disciplines that they were not talking to each other. And I think we'll see more examples of this across all the disciplines, not just biology or physics, but even, even economics. My former advisor used to say that if you need to build something, if you need a stool, a stool has to have three legs. So you need three, for any major discovery, you have to have at least three independent ways of corroborating that idea or thought, especially if it is a paradigm shift. And so what often happens is that when we don't get these different aspects, or these different groups working together, we don't see the same outcomes."

        "message": "That's so fascinating. And what you said about, you know, the virologists here and the epidemiologists there reminds me of, you know, your first chapter where you speak about the parable of the elephant, that you know, that old parable, different blind men touch different parts of an elephant and they see something different. And of course, your point in the chapter was about the virus in general, and so many different aspects of this pandemic, but that, you know, seems to be a little there in science also. Now, sort of three conceptual questions, not conceptual, but three questions around, you know, different themes. And the first of them is this, like, when I teach this writing course that I teach, I often get questions about academic writing, from people who are doing PhDs, or who have done PhDs and all of that. And, you know, because so much of what I talk about the importance of clarity in writing and all that almost goes very counter to the kind of conventions that exist. And I point them to this great essay by Agnes Gallard, who, by the way, is a force on Twitter, I just love her account. And Gallard had this fine essay, I think about three months ago, four months ago, about why academic writing is so turgid. And her point there was that, look, someone's completed a PhD, they are on the sort of tenure track, what do you need to get tenure, you need to publish specific number of papers in these specific journals, and all those journals have their own conventions, their own insider lingo, their own ways of writing. So you're optimizing for that, you're not optimizing for, say, a larger audience to get read more widely and all of that. And then that language seeps into everything else you do, maybe including letters to your family or whatever, though I would hope not, and you stop thinking about it. And I was chatting about this with another friend, Ruben Abraham recently, who told me about how, you know, this might be true for the social sciences, but in science, per se, the papers tend to be very well written, eight to 12 pages, because they're very crisp, and they know what they're doing. And they go from point A to point B, and all of that. And it's kind of more systematic. So he gave me a sort of a counter view to this saying that, look, a lot of academic writing is turgid. But there is a lot of joy in just reading a lot of science papers, because they kind of bug the trend. So now as someone who started off on that academic path, who wrote a paper, which got, you know, published in Nature and written about by here. So what is your sort of outlook on all of this? Like you have also therefore been an editor, you have received a lot of this turgid writing, you know, is it incredibly commonplace, and therefore a problem, when you sort of suggest recommendations about, you know, what changes a writer should make or how they should work on their paper? Do you also talk about the writing or do you just talk about the science and obviously, the science is more important because the content matters, but you also talk about the writing, is that an imperative? Are these journals sort of, like I understand that they will have specialized audiences, but would you also like to at least make them readable by the general public at large? And I'm sort of just kind of thinking aloud, because you seem to be the perfect person at the intersection of all of this, as both an academic, a writer, an editor, a thinker, and you know, how do you look at this space?"

        "message": "Yeah, I can definitely provide my own perspective. And having worked on a number of a few dozen journals and having launched 10 scientific journals myself, I am regularly reading papers, sometimes I tweet about them as well, I read the papers in energy, material science, microbiology, chemistry, medicine, engineering, various fields. And it's not that I understand all of them, but I have developed a sense of getting at the gist very easily. And in new fields, what I do is I usually try to do some background reading. And so some of the reviews are written in a different manner than some of the scientific papers. And that's because the review is more a very large perspective of the field as well. But a really good paper will tell you more than what the authors have actually written. It's very terse and turgid, as you say, but you will be able to from that paper, understand what the background is, what the what the reason is, why they actually did the work, you will be able to figure out what else has been done and who else is doing that. You will be able to figure out what experiments they did and what those experiments show. And you will be able to figure out what the next steps are and and what others are doing. But a scientific paper typically is not read in the same way that something else will be read where you, you read the abstract, then you read all the way through. The way that I usually read scientific paper is I read the abstract, then I look at the figures, then I look at the discussion at the end, then I go back and it's sort of it's almost like it's almost like going like hypertext, because if I see something, then I look at a reference, then I'll go down this rabbit hole of maybe even an hour following a certain reference down that way. But you are absolutely right. Titles matter, especially in this age of even of search engines, where people are finding a lot of research from from titles of articles, the titles really, really matter. The abstract has to be very succinct and has to say what has been done. Lot of journals are now doing what are known as lay summaries, which show the which demonstrate the significance for a broader audience. And I am very much in favor of these. So when I started off as a scientific editor, one of my jobs was to write these two paragraph in this issue summaries for drug discovery and biology papers. And so I was going through them and writing those up. And we even asked a lot of authors to submit that with their submissions as well. There are other journals that do this, definitely. I think one of the reasons there is good science writing and there is bad science writing, undoubtedly. One of the reasons that science is written in this sort of peculiar way is that it is very important to be accurate as opposed to be definitive in your pronouncements. You have to say what you're saying, but you also have to say these are the limitations. And that doesn't always make for a compelling read. And I think a lot of people who peddle in misinformation, and I've noticed this, they have an easier time because they don't need nuance, right? They don't need to say that this is this particular case under these conditions. And this is the setting and this is how much immunity you have. But look at this, immunity is not just the antibodies. You have all these other parts of the cells and you have T cells and these other components. They can just say, well, drink my concoction and you'll never get coronavirus. And those things are the ones that has no nuance and it's sort of seductive in a way in that they're very, I look at these WhatsApp forwards, they're actually, people should be doing research on them because they are very simple in what they're trying to demonstrate. And this completely the antithesis of what you're saying. But at some point, scientists do have to become science communicators. They have to be able to, because scientists are a part of society. The problem is that there really is no incentive for a scientist. The reward structures in science are created in such a way that scientists are always talking to other scientists. They are talking to administrators, they are trying to get grants. So by writing, for example, a popular science book, there is, a scientist is not going to get tenure, is not going to get a promotion. So I think people that do it, do it out of a sense of compulsion and maybe they have a little bit more free time. But you're absolutely right. There is a peculiar and precise way of writing in science that is almost like you have to learn another language."

        "message": "Yeah, no, the problem you've expressed is very resonant. Because the thing is, you know, the reason these, like I'm also fascinated by all the fake news that spreads. And one of the things that they get right in terms of craft is that they keep it simple. We explain the world to ourselves by telling stories about it. And simpler stories are far easier to process. You don't, you know, you don't have to consider a hundred nuances and all of that. And again, I couldn't agree with you more. I mean, this is, you know, in a different context, my friend Ajay Shah, who's a public policy guy and a great economist is also sort of, he keeps, you know, lamenting that so many economists are on this sort of academic treadmill, where they are pursuing a set of different incentives. And if they, you know, if the incentives were slightly more aligned to say the public good, which comes from, you know, communicating your ideas clearly and well, getting them out there, doing research that actually goes in those directions, rather than whatever might be fashionable in academics at the moment, perhaps the world would be a better place. Now, the thing about that I loved about your book is that it's like, I don't want to embarrass you with praise, but I thought it's just outstanding in terms of popular science writing, because you simplify everything so much, like not in a way of making it simplistic, but in a way of making it easy to understand in clear language, like a schoolboy with a lot of questions could get a lot of his questions answered through this book, without having a problem with it. Now, this process of clear writing, I want to ask you a little bit about that, you know, a few weeks ago, Krish Ashok did an episode with me where he spoke about the pyramid of learning, like, how do you learn something the best, like somebody says something to you, you learn it one way, you read something, you learn it at a different depth, but the deepest way of learning is to teach something. And in a sense, trying to write clearly for a mass audience is a form of teaching. And another thing that you know, Orwell had first brought about, and I keep talking about in my writing classes, a link between clear thinking and clear writing, and how it's a two way link, like, obviously, for a clear thinker, you're more likely to write clearly. But if you are forcing yourself to write clearly about a subject, then you have to force yourself to think deeply about it. Because then you cannot take cover in jargon or insider lingo, or, you know, obfuscatory abstract language, you have to get concrete, you have to explain everything in kind of simple terms, which you know, you've done repeatedly through the book, you know, I just noted down so many of your quotes, like proteins being like origami, or your chapter on concepts where you've spoken about the importance of shape, you quoted Carl Sagan, talking about apple pie, which I'll come to. And all of this is just utterly sort of delightful. So and nobody starts off a clear writer, right? It takes a lot of work. I mean, another thing, you know, an aside for my listeners would be that I believe writing is one of those things which you don't need any inherent quality. Everybody can be a great writer. It's just a question of making the effort. It's not like cricket that there's a certain hand-eye coordination that is natural or bowlers need fast twitch muscles or whatever. Everybody can learn to be a great writer period. So and everybody starts off bad, obviously, tell me about your journey as a writer, you know, thinking about how to make complex subjects easily understandable to a lay audience. And I feel that this must have been so much harder for you. Because in the environment that you're in, where you're reading turgid paper after turgid paper submitted by academics and my apologies to academics, I don't mean to say they're all like this, but relatively, certainly. What was your journey discovering your kind of writing voice? What were your role models? What was your journey? What was it like? Tell me a bit about that."

        "message": "Well, first of all, thank you so much for the praise. It is slightly embarrassing. But also, I have to tell you this, now that you mentioned it. One of the most puzzling but also in a backhanded way, rewarding messages I got was from my sister. So she's an engineer. And she sent me a message after she read the book. And it was like, Wow, Dada, you wrote a science book that's not like a science book at all. And it's sort of a backhanded way of saying like, reminding me of all the horrible textbooks that I read. And I was like, Okay, she's an engineer, but I really know where she's coming from with that. And but because she's a sister, it cannot be sort of a direct phrase, there has to be like this, this sense of like, how did you even do this? I, I underestimated you. But well, thank you so much for that. I will say that one of the things is that basically, I did think a lot about the analogies to use. And, and for me, I am a little bit, I like to think, obviously, mathematically, but I'm also a visual thinker. And sometimes breaking down these, these concepts into into visual pieces is very, very helpful. Fortunately, obviously, I can't embed a YouTube video into a book. But fortunately, the process of infection is such and the process of how the immune system responds, and how disease develops. And that whole cycle is such that you can sit down and basically visualize it. And so that took me a while though, as you mentioned, each individual part of that is one sentence in that book might actually be someone's science paper or nature paper, or even some some major observation that it took them a while to do. But pieced together, if you just break it down, as you mentioned early on into the individual parts of, okay, how, first of all, starting from how big is the virus? How big is the cell? What does it need to do to actually get inside the body? I mean, there are millions of viruses and you starting back and saying, why are there only 220 viruses that infect the human body? I mean, we always say, okay, viruses, they're, they're harming us. But there, among the vast number of viruses, there are only a few. So there is something special about this virus compared to other viruses. And then taking it to the next step of trying to visualize those processes, for me, at least, was very helpful. As far as right, the actual writing process itself, you are absolutely right, it was iterative. And it was iterative in the sense of also that the data was changing. I went through multiple drafts, this was not a static. This was not a static subject where I could go through a research phase and collect all the papers and then sit down in my room and then go through a writing phase. This was a project where I was doing the research and the writing simultaneously. And so I went through many drafts of writing this. But whenever I was reading a paper, apart from annotating it and marking it up, what I was also doing is I would write a summary of that paper. And then after I wrote that summary, I would come back to it asking myself, why would somebody who is not a scientist be interested in this? What would they actually get out of it that would be relevant to the bigger picture of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19? And often what would happen is that then that summary, which was two paragraphs, would then be condensed into maybe two sentences. And then after that, I would start to expand that because you don't also want to leave them with basically without any particular context or any perspective of what this might mean. So I don't know how successful I was, but that was the process that I had to use. And then integrating it together. I also, as you probably have noticed, when I wrote the book, I also had a framework of basically systematically deciding what each of these chapters would be and breaking it down into that. And that was very, very helpful to have those specific buckets. And so that I didn't go off in a way that I would if I had been doing another form of writing such as poetry or creative writing."

So people often speak of journalism as the first draft of history, which, you know, has its dangers as well. And while you're writing this book, in a sense, it is not a definitive book of everything that the COVID-19 is about, because we are still learning so much about it. We are in a sense, you know, in a fog of war situation, where there are so many things that we don't know. So is that something that kind of worried you? Or I mean, for the majority of the book, of course, you've looked at basic concepts and first principles and just kind of explained everything from scratch. And you've, you know, there's nothing in it that is in a sense going to be falsified, so to say, you've, you know, but it can provide a lay reader a bedrock of understanding exactly what is going on, which is what is so good about it. But how do you how do you then in the in the process of writing? Is there a point and this is relevant, not just to the knowledge that you're putting in the book, but also in the in terms of crafting the writing itself, that does there come a point where you say that, listen, I'm not totally happy, but I have to let it go now.

        "message": "was that like? So one thing I did do will say is that it is important to have this sense of epistemic humility that in a pandemic, you cannot know every single aspect of what is going on. And this is why it was a lot of work, but it was helpful to actually have references and notes in the back of the book where I could reference the experts and say, this particular sentence or this particular idea, which is prevalent at the time is not an idea that I have come up with, because I think a book, maybe if I write fiction in the future, that I will come up with something more imaginative, but a book on public health during a pandemic is not a time for significant independent theories or unsubstantiated ideas. So all of those chapters, I'm not an expert, I want to stress again, that I'm not an expert, I relied on my ability to translate the science and to condense it. But all of those aspects are cited in the back and people can use that as a jumping off point, as you mentioned, after they have a sense of the broader landscape. So I did not want it to be this scientific document or this monograph at all. As far as leaving it at a certain point, yes, there were aspects that obviously, I could have pursued further. And we don't have the answers to that. One thing you will notice about the book is I've always said, this is what we don't know. And I've used that as to the best of my ability to say, this information is unknown at this point of time, it may take us six months, it may take us years to look into this. And that varied from some very contentious issues, such as the lockdown, to prior immunity, to the various, the extreme heterogeneity of people who are getting very sick to people who are having asymptomatic infections, to long COVID, or post COVID syndrome, which affects different people in different ways. And so I left it at that with a sense of being comfortable with saying that, I don't know this, nobody knows definitively at this time. It was a good stopping off point in that I knew about the vaccines. So I think this, I would have felt a little bit bad, if the book had been written, and it had come out before we had approved vaccines. I also knew about the UK variant and that it was more infectious. I had not foreseen or didn't know about the other variants. And perhaps that can be sort of an additional appendix, or a 23rd chapter. But I did know that the variant was coming and that it had been shown that it was more infectious. So at that point, I did have that sense of what was going to be happening in the next few months, at least. What this book has absolutely avoided is going into the daily numbers and into the daily curves. And I did that for a number of reasons. One is that it reduces the shelf life of a book of this nature. The second aspect of this is that it takes us away from the sense of humility. Because even when I was writing this book, I said during the first wave, there were some countries that had fared well. One of them was Germany. And Germany got absolutely devastated during the winter because of some measures that they didn't take, but also because of the variant strains as well. And then I was very careful in not making any precise prognostications about the trajectory of the pandemic in India and what was happening. Because I wasn't riding the wave and I didn't want to ride the wave of saying, well, the cases went down because Indians have immunity. And then regretting a few months later, well, I was wrong here, the cases went up. And so I tried to avoid that as much as possible. With all of that said, because I'm in a field where the shelf life of documents and of papers is very short to begin with, this is something that we are all resigned to. I know that when I wrote my thesis, when I write papers, when any one of us writes anything, it is going to get outdated pretty soon. So we try to do our best. The book allowed me an opportunity to, as you pointed out, and thank you for saying that, try to bring in the broader concepts, which I hope will not be obsolete in the near future."

So do consider that the miracle that I am asking my questions on the 13th and he is answering them on the 12th, the miracles of science, perhaps. I'm struck by this phrase that you used, epistemic humility, because I used it in a prior episode. And then one of my guests used it in a previous episode, in an episode after that, when we were talking about COVID, in fact, the policy responses to it. And someone wrote into me saying, hey, Amit, you say never use jargon, why have you? But yeah, but in a sense, you know, to not to cut the jargon part of it, you can say it's just about being humble about what you know. And that's kind of what I want to ask you about, because it strikes me that there is, if you're achieving excellence in anything, you know, there is this balance to be struck between having confidence in what you are, what you know, and what you're capable of, and also having the humility to learn more. And, you know, an example I often give is, you know, people think Virat Kohli is like a very aggro kind of person, arrogant and full of himself. But to get to the level where he is, he must have spent 1000s of hours in the nets focusing on what he's doing wrong. So there is an inbuilt humility in that process. Now, in the world of science, also, it strikes me that if you're too humble, if you think that I don't know anything, everything could be wrong, it possibly becomes difficult to proceed. So you have to have a certain amount of belief in your knowledge and the value of the work you are doing, and so on and so forth. But at the same time, there also has to be a certain amount of humility, like what you pointed out in the clash between or the argument between the virologists and the epidemiologists. And, you know, there has to be that humility and that openness. And you can't just sit back and say that, no, this is my field, who are these other lay people to, you know, comment on it and, you know, make Twitter threads about something that they haven't actually received training in. So, given that you are someone who's obviously, due to the work due to being an editor, due to being a science writer, or, you know, that's inbuilt in you. But when you look at all these people who are submitting papers, people who are working on the cutting edge of science, how does that come in? What is the level of humility you think that we need? You know, is this a trap that people fall into, of not having adequate humility? What's your take on this?"

And scientists in general, the one thing is they'll do love to talk about their work with anyone. I think that is basically the hook to if you're talking to anyone from someone starting off with their lab or someone who has won the Nobel Prize. If you just ask them what they do and why they do it, they can go on for a really long time. But there are people who are very good at, and at a certain extent, you are absolutely right. You have to play up the value of your work. And sometimes that is actually exaggerated. The thing is other scientists are, after a while, very good at picking up on those exaggerations. I don't think the public always is, and sometimes the press can even be taken for a ride. So I don't blame the press for this when a scientist said, well, and we see a lot of this in the media as well, when someone says, well, I have now created this molecule in my lab and it works really well against cancer cells. And so it gets, and they get taken in by that. But someone in the field would also know that the path to drugs is treacherous. Very few promising drugs actually make it down that path to actually become drugs that become approved and used in humans. And so some people are very, very good about exploiting that and using that to their benefit. But you're right. So everyone has to do it to a certain extent. Complete humility doesn't get you anywhere. I mean, nobody knows what you're doing and there has to be a certain amount of excitement also conveyed to the audience. And that has to come across both in the way that scientists speak, but also in the way that they write. Otherwise, it's just a collection of facts. And so they may seem like dry stories, but a lot of the research articles are actually presented in the form of a narrative. It's a different form of a narrative, but it is a narrative."

But when you read the rest of the newspaper, you take it as gospel because, hey, it's in a big newspaper. Now, you know, journalists tend to be generalists and that's more true today than ever, you know, Prem Panikkar in a recent episode with me spoke about how this is one of the things where Indian journalism is just in a horrendous place that you have cost cutting. It's always journalists who are let go. And if you have less journalists, you have more journalists. If you have, sorry, if you have less journalists, you have more generalists and you know, so your science beat reporter with a few notable exceptions won't necessarily be someone who really gets it. And that can actually harm, you know, how the people sort of understand science. So a dual question here. One is that, is this a big problem and are there ways around it? And the other question is that what technology has run in the last 20 years is that any specialist can go out there and put, you know, her views out there. You can start a blog, you can start a newsletter, you can make YouTube videos, all the technology is within our reach. So you don't have these gatekeepers anymore, anyone can communicate. Of course, the gatekeepers fulfill a useful function of being a filter for quality. But you could argue that water finds its own level in any case. So, you know, whether you're on YouTube or blogging, ultimately, the quality of your work will determine the kind of credibility that you have. So there is this dual thing where, you know, journalism and I find and I find that that this is inevitably true. Whenever I read journalism about a subject, I know something about I am like WTF is this, you know, and but at the same time, what I am heartened by is that a lot of people who are either specialists or are sort of passionate about a subject are going out making their own content, all of that. So, you know, in the broader context of bringing science to the people of sort of popularizing all of this, what do you think? What's the ecosystem like? How is this playing out?"

And I think I want to say that despite some of the challenges, many journalists during the pandemic, despite the constraints and the lack of information and knowledge, have done a tremendous job. And there are some Indian journalists as well who have even in the midst of even when the transparency hasn't been 100%, they have tried to get the best information. And so I do want to applaud them for for what they've done. As you mentioned, we all have our narrow focuses. And I can speak to what happens in in science and in science journalism. And I think the first thing that has to happen is that people need to be fine with with paying for good content. I mean, that's that's essentially where it starts. Good journalism takes time, it takes money, and it takes it's a person's profession. And so we have to be fine with paying for it. And then once we pay for it, we have to be fine with investing in those organizations. And in those journalists, I think if newsrooms are getting cut, and if newspapers are worried about about their science pages, then that's going to have an effect despite regardless of everything else, that's definitely going to have an effect. The other thing is that science takes time to get answers. And if sometimes if someone has a deadline that they have to get something out, that is 500, 600 words, by by 4pm, or 9pm, then it becomes very difficult to get a full story to be able to do that background reading and to get that research done. And so often what happens is that we see results that are presented uncritically without the broader picture, the broader framework of of what actually happened there. So often, it is just a rehash of the press release, and then a bunch of quotes from different people. And it's sort of this drip drip system of getting news out that doesn't put the picture in a bigger context. I would also say that journalists often strive for balance. And balance isn't always necessarily a necessarily a good thing if we're talking about topics like deforestation, or climate change or pollution, or, or air pollution, or groundwater being polluted. And you bring in all the scientists on one side, and then you bring in either the person who's polluting, or you bring in all the people who believe or have data that backs up climate change, anthropogenic climate change, and then you bring in industry interests on the other side. That's not balance. And so putting what happens is if you put both sets of quotes together, then it looks like that it's balanced. But I think journalists have to be reporters have to be fine with moving away from that sense of balance, with that sense of reporting everything as a as a short piece of something and trying to instead bring it into a framework of putting more context into it. But all of that requires money."

And, you know, but this becomes difficult if you're a generalist, and you have to turn in a piece by four o'clock, because you don't possibly have the base of knowledge to be able to make those judgments yourself, which is why I think we kind of need more specialists.

And I would say, for a time, I was reading all the major stories in Indian Express, Washington Post and the New York Times, particularly during that lockdown phase, when there were a lot of reports coming out. And, and I use Mendeley, which is a reference manager. And so what it has is it has this web plugin, where when I go to the website of a publisher, scientific publisher, and I see that, that paper, I can click on the PDF, and it will immediately download that PDF and put it into the database. And then in the database, it's also a reference manager, it has all the references there. So I can see all of those papers, and later I can I can read those, I read and annotate on my iPad. And I like to use the highlighter feature to do that as well. I still sometimes take for the for the actual outlines of the chapters, I use notebooks, I like to basically draw mind maps, and and do that, go through that process for for doing that as well. So I would say those are the the main ways that I, I decided, or I figured out how to do it. There are some really good accounts on Twitter that are a good source of information in terms of so I did bookmark a certain number of tweets of of people as well, to get some information. As far as my own Twitter account, I used it as as a test testing ground for seeing what people were interested in over the course of the year, they didn't know I was writing a book, I hadn't decided at that point either. But how I was framing things, whether that was useful or not. And I did a couple of of polls as well through the year, that definitely helped me out with that. One thing about the coronavirus pandemic, I'll say is that almost all scientific publishers made their coronavirus content free and outside of the paywall.

He is a cardiologist by training, but he's been on top of the Coronavirus pandemic. His, his work, his tweets are mainly covering the scientific articles. So some of it may be a little bit technical, but he covers all the major outlets, nature, science, cell, and some of the other journals as well.

Natalie Dean is a professor in Florida, and she's a bio statistician. And that is very, very helpful to understand the statistical aspects and the mathematics beyond the, for example, the efficacy trials and herd immunity and things like that. Mark Lipsitch is a professor at Harvard Chan, and he is one of the leading epidemiologists who talked about the parameters of the pandemic early on. Karl Bergstrom is at University of Washington. He's written this book called Calling Bullshit with Jevin West. And that is about misinformation and dealing with, with misinformation. And his Twitter account is a source of a lot of great wisdom regarding misinformation during the pandemic. Adam Kucharski is at, is in the UK, I think at a School of Tropical Medicine, if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, and he has some really good work. He's written the Rules of Contagion, which is a book written before the pandemic, but it has some of the mathematical aspects of, of how to deal with pandemics and the parameters of that. And there are some other accounts as well. Ed Yong, obviously, Carl Zimmer, Helen Branswell, they are writing some absolutely top notch work as well. In terms of following the science as it is coming out, I would say there are some really good Twitter accounts. So there's a news account for Science Magazine and a news account for Nature. The news articles in Science and Nature are definitely geared towards more of a lay audience as opposed to the peer reviewed scientific research that gets published there. I also get the Nature newsletter every day. It's a very nice newsletter that has a roundup of all aspects of science in a very accessible manner, including, for example, the search for life on, on Venus and the search for life on Mars and things like that. So it's, it gives a broader perspective of that. For those who are interested in biology, at a slightly deeper level, there is a magazine called The Scientist. And that covers a lot of in depth articles in science as well. So but I think following some Twitter accounts and then getting some newsletters is definitely very helpful in keeping up to date."

So a couple of questions while we are, you know, before we actually get take a break and get to your book, who were your influences when it comes to science writing? You know, like when you sort of start thinking about the notion that science needs to be popularised that it cannot just be academics talking to each other. When you think about writing your own book, is there something that you're looking at as a model and saying, you know, this book nailed it or this is a kind of voice that I want and so on. So what was sort of influences in that sense? And they don't even have to be overt influences where, you know, you take a model from something or whatever, but which are the science books that you have loved reading as you have grown up? Or, you know, is there a book that kind of changed the way you think about the world or that caused that moment where you know, a light bulb goes on in your head and you see things differently?"

And his way of connecting and bringing the social passion, the passion for social justice into science and the broader picture is absolutely evident. And people, when they talk about Carl Sagan, they talk about Cosmos. But the Demon Haunted World is a much, much better and deeper book. Cosmos was a companion to a television show that was that I came out, I believe came out in 79 or 80, whereas the Demon Haunted World was much later and contained full length articles. So definitely, I like his work. I feel that the physicists do a much better job in general than the biologists in conveying maybe because their questions are grander on a grand on a much grander scale. So if you think about like Brian Greene or Michio Kaku or Jim Al-Khalili, who wrote what I thought was the best science book last year, which is The World According to Physics, has done a really, really good job with respect to that. I read voraciously. So I read last year, I read about 100 books, of which many of them were definitely science books. Michael Benton does a tremendous job in talking about dinosaurs. And I think that's a topic that a lot of people are interested in. So yeah, there are definitely a lot of people who do write well. In general, my observation is that the physicists do a much better job than the biologists."

Now, my final question before the break and before we get to both the delightful subject of your book and the difficult subject of COVID-19, which is that through the process of writing this book, how have you changed? How has it changed you as a person, as a writer, as someone who thinks about the world, you know, because writing forces you not just to examine your subject that much more deeply, it also forces you to examine yourself, you know, and especially in these difficult times, I think there's a lot of self reflection everyone has kind of gone through, which for a writer can become explicit, because sometimes they're writing about it, sometimes they're not, maybe it's not even in the book, maybe it's in sort of the meditative tweets that you might put out once in a while. But through this period, through the last few months, when you've written this book, how have you kind of personally changed? How are you different from what you were say, you know, 15 months ago?"

        "message": "Yeah, I had never planned to write this book. This was I never thought that this would be my first book. If I thought that I would be writing something I had actually thought that I would be writing perhaps fiction or in Bangla or meditative essays about about travel or cooking or something of that nature. But when the pandemic struck, I felt and people were asking me all these questions, I felt that there was because of my experience, I had at least something that I could offer. And so I felt that it was a sense of obligation that I had to write this. It was a very humbling experience, the entire pandemic, but the course of writing. And, and I will say that I am now more attuned to myself and more. I think I'm fine with saying I don't know, and I'm fine with more uncertainty now. I was more certain about certain things at the start of the pandemic. And as and moving forward, that has changed. I had started with the idea of writing a book that would be a mainly a scientific book, but very early on, it became evident that that the science alone was not going to determine the outcome of this pandemic, it's not going to determine the outcome of any aspect of the major challenges that humans face today, including climate change or deforestation or antimicrobial resistance. Science is probably one of the easier pieces. I mean, if we look at the scientists worked hard, they got the vaccines created in time. But that is just a small piece of of the larger tapestry of society and all the the the components that go into this pandemic. And the other realization was that every single source of inequality or of injustice that we had in our society was magnified during the pandemic. We like to say that, okay, we are all in this together. I do not believe that now having gone through this, we are not all in it together in the same way for someone like me, who was privileged and I did get a sense of my own privilege of being able to actually stay at home and write a book during a pandemic. I mean, that's immense privilege. And someone else who is basically having a difficult time making his or her living. That is that is definitely something that got magnified. And the other pieces of I mentioned some of these things in the book is that we tell people to wash their hands. But how can we tell someone who doesn't have clean water how to wash their hands with soap? How can we tell someone who lives in the slums to socially distance? So we have to make our society more equitable. And that was for me, one of the other observations. And then finally, a lot of the things that I saw that I feared would happen, and they did happen because of this, this sense of mistrust in science and this, this society that where we have built where experts are often vilified. And this happened to a great extent in the United States where I currently live. But it happened elsewhere as well, where we were the science was way ahead of what people were doing. But people were still dying because they were not taking simple measures. I mean, wearing a mask became an ideological issue. That should be a public health matter. And we can go on and on about that. But I think overall, it was a very, very humbling experience for me to see that and to see the disparities. I mentioned a couple of examples in the book. One of them is in the part on the impact where I was talking about a large fraction of the world is not going to get basic immunizations for diseases like measles. And on the other hand, there are privileged people in other parts of the world who are using zoom and they don't like how they look on zoom. And they're going for plastic surgery. So just by putting these two facts together, you can see the dichotomy in society. Or even during the lockdown, we had people who travel for miles and they didn't even have any food, they had nothing to eat. And on the other hand, we there are people who are surreptitiously getting onto golf courses because they needed to get their 18 holes of golf in during the pandemic. And so, yeah, it's just the scale of this was, was perhaps you don't see that outside of a pandemic. But definitely it brought into sharp relief the divisions that we have in our society. So it started off as a science book, it definitely didn't end that way. And it's definitely changed me as well through the process of writing this."

So it's not a big deal. Just shoot up my laptop, do what I do, it's completely okay. But especially in India, these differences are so stark. If you look at what happened to the migrant laborers, you know, they used to be stories during the partition that when trains from Pakistan would come into India, or vice versa, trains from India would go there, you know, the train would reach the final destination with everyone inside it dead because they had been killed. And I did an episode with Ruben Mascarenas on, you know, who did a lot of work feeding hungry people during the pandemic in Mumbai. And he spoke about how, you know, there were actually trains where they would put a migrant worker on a train and they would feed them in Mumbai, but everywhere else there's no one feeding them. And three days later, you know, the guy stumbles out on the platform wherever he is in his hometown and just dies, dies of starvation in in like the 21st century. So that's, that's just completely nuts. We will, of course, discuss a little bit more about the politics of it after the break. The other thing that I think the pandemic really made stark, especially in an Indian context is how dysfunctional our state is. The various ways, I mean, the state fundamentally in India, I've always said there is no rule of law for most people. The state is absent, it doesn't do any of the things that it should do properly and does a lot of things that it should not do at all. And we've seen an exacerbation of this. Like it's just coming to stark relief through the last few months. I've written a column on this, which I linked from the show notes. But it's kind of distressing that, you know, that in a sense, in this terrible tragedy, at least there are some things that we should be able to see more clearly, which should not immediately get normalized as this gets over. And these are these thoughts are too deep, we have to take a break. So we'll take a break and come back in a minute. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009, and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at India uncut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to India uncut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free.

Thank you. Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Anirban Mahapatra about his fabulous book on COVID-19. And let's actually now start talking about COVID-19. You know, in your book, I love the sequencing in your book where you have these 22 chapters, each of them is like a one word thing, you know what it's about, you go really systematically through all of the book. Let's let's kind of begin though with your chapter three, which kind of gets down to the most, you know, at a fundamental level talking about the virus itself or even chapter four, where you talk about how structure is related to function, which is something I randomly say in the case of content where it is certainly true, the structure of your content determines what your content actually is. But I was fascinated and almost blown away to find that it's like that in biology as well, that shape determines everything, you know, which is I was never taught that in school, not that I was particularly attentive in the biology class. Tell me a little bit more about that."

        "message": "Yeah, I was not taught that at school either. And I mentioned that in the book that it's one of the most fundamental concepts in biology and definitely one of the most mind blowing aspects is, well, all biology is at a certain level chemistry and all chemistry if you go down deeper is physics. And most of physics is is mathematics. But at the level of biological molecules, when we have different biological molecules that perform different functions, the shape determines often what the function of that molecule is. And by by shape, I mean, the the the actual structure is is not static as well, the structure is changing over time. And one of the examples that I use in the book that might be relevant for for someone who's who's interested in COVID-19 is this example of now the infamous spike, which is on the surface of the coronavirus and juts out and gives the virus this sun like appearance and and how different changes to its actual shape are determining how well it infects cells. So it has a complementary surface to the to the the ACE2 receptor, which has a different function in the body. It's a it's a cellular receptor on on certain cells. But what the virus is capable of doing is is using that to get its viral package inside cells. Now one concept in this is that that I just mentioned is is the is the shape changes over time what we have seen. So OK, so let me step back again. The shape of this is determined by the building blocks. In in this case, it's a protein. So the building blocks are the amino acids. As I mentioned earlier, there are typically 20 of these. So if we can think of this as almost like a Lego set, and there are different pieces that are getting put here, that's the same set is used by the virus. And it's the same set used by by humans. And that is one of the unifying concepts across biology is that proteins. I mean, that's why the the blueprint that determines this is called the universal genetic code, because it's this this this blueprint of numbers. Sorry, it's this blueprint of letters. And as I mentioned it, this gets translated into transcribed into this intermediate compound and then get gets translated into this origami like three dimensional structure, which is which is quite fascinating. But in the case of the coronavirus, what was observed was the spike protein or parts of the spike protein were able to bind or attach because of the complementarity of the shape and some of the chemistry were able to attach reasonably well to the ACE2 receptor one part of it, which is the cognate part. So the part of the spike protein that was binding is called the receptor binding domain and it was it was attaching quite nicely and doing so at a way that was we can calculate that in terms of biochemical parameters. It was doing that better than the original SARS, which as you may recall was not as infectious. Now, what structural biologists, so this is entire field of biology called structural biology. And what they do is they create structures of of various proteins and other biological molecules and they use that structure to determine what the function is and how that function might might change over time. Structural biologists were very quick to determine the structure of the spike of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus. What they had noticed that one part of this of this protein, which has a little bit over 1,300 different amino acids. So you can think about this as a three dimensional structure of or over 1,300 amino acids. And what they noticed is that there was this one part of the cell that was hanging out, let's say, as a hand. But on the other side, there was another piece that was that was not fitting it or it was it was attaching to it, but almost not in a perfect complementary manner. Now, what they had predicted at that time is that if the other side was also like an open hand, then there would be a better touching point. Remarkably, that was that is actually what has been observed for one of the variants. So this is a case where structure and function are absolutely related, where the complementarity of a structure on the on the receptor and a structure on the virus are so well attuned through the process of evolution, that we have a variant now that is more infectious. And what basically blows my mind is that we are looking at differences on the atomic level of something, a virus that we cannot see is this nanoscale virus that has real world implications for millions of people, billions of people around the world. So that is definitely one of these cases. The other thing is that the immune responses. So right now, as we are speaking, there's a lot of discussion about the variants and whether the vaccines will work and whether people will get reinfected after they get infected by one of these variants, particularly the one that came from Brazil and the other one that came from South Africa. Those are the two of major concern right now. We don't know much about the one that is that has come up in Maharashtra and and perhaps we will in the next few days. So what antibodies do is they also use this concept of structure by trying to find the piece of the virus that is attaching to the cell and getting there first because they attach better, getting there first and blocking it, actually physically blocking it from attaching to the receptor. And at one level, this is so visual and so beautiful, but this is not something that we are we are taught in biology in class at all. We basically thought of it as a number of or biology is taught as a series of facts that we have to memorize."

Everything has a different kind of shape. Yeah. And what the virus does is that it kind of, you know, mutates and mutates and then natural selection will, you know, throw up these random variants which fit perfectly. And, you know, then they fit perfectly and they can replicate. And so that kind of becomes much more common. And you know what antibodies do and what a lot of, you know, medical ways of fighting this is also at the level of geometry. Like if there is a spike that is fighting something, either you sort of create something that fits that spike first or you attack the spike or wherever the spike is fitting, you fit that with something else. So the spike has nowhere to go. I hope I'm not being too kind of simplistic, but this is such a sort of, you know, just thinking about the geometry of it and the way that you made it visual was so kind of fascinating. Let's, you know, take a step further back. What is a virus? You know, tell me a little bit about how we should because most lay people just know that, oh, there are germs and there are bacteria and there are viruses and it's like two different categories like Hindu, Muslim and, you know, and so but what are viruses? Where do they come from? I remember at one point, you've, you know, spoken in your chapter on the coronavirus on how before there were any living creatures, it was an RNA world, right, you know, and you've spoken about how viruses are the most successful biological entities, you know, another interesting sort of TIL for me there are, you write at one point, quote, even in the human body, there are probably 100 times as many viruses as there are human cells. So what are kind of viruses? Exactly? How do they interact with the human body? How do they evolve? How do they grow? What's the whole deal? What's the role that they play?"

        "message": "We can we can do a whole episode on this, but I'll try to keep this absolutely succinct. Viruses are and they are obligate parasites in that they have functions that are similar to living things once they're inside living things. So they absolutely have to get inside other living, they have to get inside living cells to be able to replicate and by replicate, I mean that they create new virus particles and that fulfills their prerogative from a perspective of evolution of spreading. And so a virus just wants to spread and by saying just wants to spread, maybe I'm treating it in a more, giving it a human-like property, but that's not the case. This is just simply the biological prerogative or the biological objective rather of the virus to spread. So outside of a body, a virus is very much like a chemical. It is not living, it doesn't have that many living attributes, but within cells it definitely has a lot of the hallmarks of living entities. And viruses may predate life, that's definitely one of the theories. There are other theories, especially that have come in the last few years from a certain class of viruses known as giant viruses that they may actually be stripped down version or some of them at least may be stripped down versions of cells. So for every living organism, starting from bacteria all the way up to humans and definitely plants, there are viruses that infect them and can parasitize viruses. Not all viruses are harmful and this is something that is definitely lost on a lot of people. They are involved in biogeochemical cycles, especially in the water where there are a large number of bacteria. And so viruses that infect bacteria are known as bacteriophages and they are involved in a lot of the turnover in water. Scientists are now even looking to viruses for therapeutic uses, in particular cases for bacteria that have become resistant to a number of antibiotics by figuring out which viruses do this. And there's some really exciting work that has come up on bacteriophage therapy in the last few years with respect to that. Viruses are a huge class of biological entities. Some of them have RNA as their genetic material and the coronaviruses are a category of viruses there. And then there are the DNA viruses as well. The RNA viruses are particularly promiscuous. RNA is not a molecule that is used as genetic material in living organisms because of certain reasons. DNA is better suited for that, but it still stays on in certain viruses. And they have a very high mutation rate, as people are now finding out with the coronavirus that we're looking at right now and the disease that it's causing. Viruses have been infecting us since life began. And there are traces of viruses in our own genetic code. Certain classes of viruses which are known as retroviruses, they actually integrate into our genetic material. Now coronaviruses are not retroviruses, so they're slightly different. So we actually have the archaeological remains of viral infections in our own genetic material, and that's more than 8%. So even if we disregard all the viruses that are inside our body, so we are also part virus because of the viral genetic material we have in our genomes. One of my pet peeves actually to go off on an aside is the synonymous use of genetic code with genome. They're slightly different. So I wanted to get that right."

And then the other aspect about is from a public health perspective, antibiotics work against bacteria, but they don't work against viruses. Antivirals are much fewer in number as we are painfully finding out during this coronavirus pandemic. And that's definitely not the case with bacteria.

And you said that a virus needs to enter a cell to replicate. Tell me about this process of replication. Like let's say a virus figures out a way to enter a cell, which in the case of the coronavirus, which by the way, you've described the history in the book about why it's called a coronavirus is that when they first saw it, it sort of was a little bit like the corona of the sun. So they kind of went with that. So how does, you know, once a virus enters a cell, what is the process there? How does it replicate? What are the different components of that?"

        "message": "So one of the things about the virus actually getting in the cell is it's a random process. Viruses don't have any way of propelling themselves. A lot of bacteria can do that. So through random means, a virus will find a cell and it will find a receptor. And that's why viruses often are in like these teeming large numbers. And as we discussed earlier, there are so many different viruses. So we are probably ingesting through the air, as we're speaking now, a number of viruses as well. But they're not causing disease because they have to be able to find the specific receptor that they can recognize to be able to get inside. And it's similarly with when I'm drinking tea or eating anything, there might be plant viruses there. But over, even among the animal viruses, there are over 1.6 million predicted animal viruses, but only a few are able to infect humans. Once they get inside cells, though, their immediate job is to create the protein part of the cell, which is a structural part of the additional virus particles, but also to replicate their genomes. And in the case of the coronavirus, the genetic material is the RNA. And that serves both as the template. So the beauty for the virus perspective, the beauty from the perspective of the virus is that that can serve both as the blueprint for the creation of these other particles that it will need as building blocks, but it's also the genetic material so it can make copies of that. So it's making both the structure and the genetic material from this compound. Now, one thing about the virus, though, is that the RNA viruses, they are, because they don't use DNA as their genetic material, they have a different copier enzyme than we do. And this is called the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. And part of that, or that, and that enzyme is often used as a target for drugs because we don't have it in our body. One of the drugs that has been used during this pandemic to stop the coronavirus infections, at least early on, is remdesivir. And remdesivir, one of the modes of action that it's thought to work is to stop this RNA dependent polymerase, this copier enzyme, from making future copies of itself and being able to, being able to replicate. The virus also brings in a couple of other enzymes of its own, and these are turning out to be targets as well. There are, I mentioned, there's a, there's a class of enzyme called proteases. And these are basically, they act as cleavers. And they cut at very specific sites when the entire protein is created. So basically, it's like a large, almost like a large piece of cloth that has to be cut at specific places to make designs. And those are going to be part of the building blocks of the virus. So that's another target right now. And I know Pfizer right now has a drug in, in phase one of clinical trials to, to hit those. So one of the ways of drug discovery, as you mentioned, is that the structure determines what the drugs will be and using that structure activity relationship to create drugs for these unique targets that are found within the virus, but not within people. And so, and the reason for that is then there will be less adverse effects. Once the virus particles or once the subunits of the virus and the genetic material are made, then they're assembled within the cell. For this entire process, the cellular machinery has been hijacked. So it's basically our cellular machinery that is making the virus particles for themselves. And it uses a part of the cell as well to be able to get outside as well. And this system is mostly used to get rid of cellular trash. So it uses the trash compaction system. So it uses one system of receptors to get in, then it completely subverts our cellular machinery to make the virus copies of itself. And then it uses the trash compaction system to get out."

        "message": "That's beautiful. And I love the phrase trash compaction. You know, maybe it can be used one day in the context of the IT cell of certain parties. But so I kind of want to take a brief digression, not exactly a digression, because it's a point you mentioned in your book also, but I think it's worth stressing on for many lay readers. You know, one of the big sort of aha moments of my life, which really made me look at the world differently was when I discovered natural selection. Like Douglas Adams once said, you know, that there's no reason to believe in God, because if you just understand natural selection, the awe of what you experience is far beyond anything that any religion can give you. And you yourself here have quoted someone called Theodosius Dobzhansky, who writes, quote, nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. So at the risk of getting a little too simple, but just, you know, in case there are lay people listening to this who might be wondering that, hey, this is so incredibly complex that it's, you know, you've got a virus getting inside the cell, it's got this mechanism, it's got that mechanism, it's copying itself, RNA is happening, cell also has trash, trash compaction units, it's got an IT cell of its own. And all this, you know, humongous complex shit is happening, you know, surely there is God who designed this. And what do you mean when a virus wants to replicate? So I just want to take a brief moment to kind of talk about that, which I will do in my simple terms. And if I've missed out anything or missed a nuance, you can kind of fill in because I think, you know, understanding natural selection is just so key to understanding our world and life, which is basically that look, there are millions of viruses, they don't all fit into cells. And, you know, but they will all mutate in different ways. And accidentally, some will happen to fit into cells, and they'll get into the cells, right? Part one done. Now, out of all the ones that get in accidentally, you know, there will be a few that have the right properties to start one process. And out of all of those, there will be a few that will have the properties to start another process. And at the end of all of this, the ones that successfully replicate are the ones who were essentially formed by accident. But once they are, they replicate and then there are more and more of the viruses like that. So it almost seems like so when you say a virus wants to spread, that wanting is a metaphor. Yes. So you know, if anyone hasn't read Richard Dawkins's book, The Selfish Gene or a lot of his other work, Daniel Dennett as well, go out and kind of do that, because that will explain it much better than I can. But this whole process is so joyous, that is iteration, iteration, iteration, everything is accidental. But then something just works and multiplies. And you can ascribe directionality to this and say, hey, this was meant to be or you can, you know, ascribe intention to the virus, a virus wants to do this, the virus is a bad guy. And all of that, you know, understanding natural selection is so much the bedrock of this that I thought I should bring in this aside for people who like I once wasn't exposed to it and understand it. It's just it's always when I think about it, that how everything is emerged from it is so incredibly wonderful. So did I leave out anything essential in my"

        "message": "brief description? I think you you you hit the nail on the head with the importance of evolution by natural selection, as you mentioned, I even included it in the book and had it as part of a chapter on on concepts, because it is an absolutely essential concept to understanding anything in biology, your description of it is accurate, I would say, one other piece that I would definitely add is that there's always a selection pressure. That's what's basically driving the selection of those changes. Because otherwise, somebody might say, well, what is the designer, what is pushing it towards it becoming more infectious, and it's that selection pressure. And then the other thing is that it's always happening because the world is not static situations are changing all the time. And I would say that's the other really, really beautiful thing about it is there is no static environment in the world anywhere. And so what may seem like an organism getting an upper hand briefly, over time and over 4 billion years of evolution, that doesn't seem to be the case at all. So I absolutely love it. And everything I I try to understand in biology, I definitely try to understand from the perspective of evolution by natural selection. And to those naysayers who doubt it and don't understand what you mentioned, the repetitive or the iterative process of natural selection, people are using it now. And there's Francis Arnold won a Nobel Prize, and others have been using it as well, for actual benefit to be able to use the process by having this repetitive process and the selective force to make proteins and other macromolecules even better over time. And this is what is known as directed evolution. And it's a definitely a force in biological engineering to use evolution as a force for for creating molecules. So everything doesn't have to be rational. I guess that's my main point is if you have a large number of molecules and you have this selection pressure, and you give nature time, then over time, it will find a way to get through."

Now, I would think that logically, a virus doesn't actually have to harm the host. You know, it's like, which are the successful domestic animals are the dogs and cats and the ones that get along with us and, you know, perform different kinds of emotional functions for us, which are completely beneficial. If they weren't, they wouldn't be domestic animals. Similarly, you'd imagine that a virus to replicate successfully and to not have, you know, medicines targeted at it and all of that would be ones which would cause no harm to the host and they would just chill and the host would just keep spreading them and everybody's happy. It's a positive some game and so on and so forth. But so is it the case that there are many, many viruses and most of them are completely harmless and they spread like that. And there are only a few that are accidentally dangerous to hosts and it's not actually necessary for them to go back to the metaphor to harm the host. Or, you know, so what's going on here? What's the deal here? Why do they harm us? They don't need to harm us."

        "message": "That's an absolutely fantastic question. I'm glad you asked that question. And you are absolutely spot on that the essential aspect of the virus is not disease. Disease is important to us from our perspective as someone who has been infected. The reason we care about certain viruses is because they cause disease. I mean, you can think about this coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. If it had gone through humans without causing any disease, then perhaps we might have identified it by accident or perhaps not even at all. And we only think about the viruses that tend to cause disease and more often serious disease. I wrote about the previous pandemic when I was a managing editor. I wrote an editorial about H1N1 influenza and that pandemic was not taken very seriously because it didn't cause severe disease. It spread reasonably well, not as well as SARS-CoV-2, but it spread reasonably well, but it didn't cause disease. Disease is an outcome of a virus spreading well, because if you remember the process that we discussed, once the virus actually gets inside the cell, it uses up some of the cell resources and the cell machinery. So if it is very successful in replicating, then it causes harm to the cell. And so that is one of the primary outcomes. The secondary outcome is often what we see as disease is not caused by the virus, but by our reaction to the virus. And often in cases of COVID-19, that second phase of the dysregular or abnormal immune response is what is causing harm in people. And that's why some people are receiving dexamethasone as well towards that phase. And so if you are not able to mount the appropriate immune response, not a too strong immune response, not too weak an immune response, if it's too strong an immune response, what can happen is then the immune response is actually destroying many of the cells and inside the body as well. And that is actually what is happening in a number of cases of COVID-19, where the virus itself is not causing that damage. But it is really a great question that you ask. Early on, what microbiologists thought was essentially what you are saying, and you will still find some microbiologists who believe that over the course of time, a virus will invariably grow weaker in terms of how it causes disease as it gets more attuned to the host. And so what happens is with a zoonotic infection, because it doesn't have that much of a quote unquote history with us, at that early time, then it can cause more severe disease, but over time, it gets milder. However, new modeling studies suggest that that may not be the case. And the reason for that is actually what is playing out in real time with these variants, where it, as we just discussed, nothing is static in biology. So it's not that there is one direction that it can go. For the virus, the mathematical optimal situation is one where it is not a complete pushover. But it's also not killing the host before it's able to spread to other people. So it has this sort of range in the middle where it can settle in where it can cause some disease, even severe disease in some people, but it's creating a lot more of a viral load that it can infect other people. So the short answer is it's not as simple as even microbiologists thought it was maybe 100 years ago."

And we'll discuss that a little more, because I want to talk about bats also and murdered minks, which is makes me very sad. But before we get to that, I'm kind of curious about this point, you mentioned about the optimal virus, right? Because if you think of it in game theoretic terms, and you think of, you know, somebody creating viruses and is a great game theorist, what do you do? And what you don't want to do is create something like Ebola. Now, Ebola is very lethal. It kills a large percentage of the people who get it, but it doesn't spread that easily. It is not a symptomatic spread. And you know, once you know someone's really ill, they can get isolated. Whereas, so you want a virus that spreads a lot equally, you want it all you want a certain amount of lethality. If it kills nobody, it's really like what is a virus even doing so that your evil virus designer is not successful there. So it seems that you need a certain sort of level of infectiousness and a certain level of lethality. And your ideal virus should be something that is spread by asymptomatic people. And even people who don't have severe symptoms who don't realize what's going on and the lethality comes later. So you are killing a certain percentage of the people but not too many, because then it doesn't spread that well. Is it fair to say that SARS-CoV-2 or the you know, this COVID-19 virus basically is as close to optimal as possible?"

        "message": "There are certain aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that make it also very difficult to deal with compared to a number of other viruses. And definitely the way that it's spread makes it primed for a pandemic because it's a respiratory virus. And because with other things like there have been pandemics in the past that have been caused by cholera, but cholera has been mainly eradicated from many countries. And we can choose to not drink the same type of water. We can definitely choose to not eat the same kind of meat or even the same food. But we all have to breathe the same air. I mean, we can filter it to a certain extent. But that's one of the reasons, the fact that it's a respiratory virus. And then a lot of the spread is asymptomatic, as you mentioned. And a lot of the infectiousness is during that early phase of asymptomatic. That silent spread is happening in a number of people who are carriers that make it very difficult to control as well. But even among the viruses, you hit on a really great point. But even among the viruses, you mentioned Ebola. Ebola, because it kills the people that it infects, it has to have a massive viral load. It is basically teeming and coming out of every orifice of the person who is infected. And even when the person dies, the World Health Organization has been saying, you have to be very careful about how you perform the last rites of these bodies. Because often, what happens with Ebola is that it is a disease that spread through love, through caregivers who want to take care of those who are ill, and who want to give the last rites to others. Because it spreads in such massive numbers. On the other hand, there are other viruses that cause these type of chronic and latent infections. And they don't need those large numbers and they don't need to cause disease immediately. And definitely, HIV is one of them. The virus that causes hepatitis is another one of them. And so in most people, they can be sort of causing no disease at all and asymptomatic. And most people won't even know about it. And they can even linger in people for years before they have a type of disease. And so in those cases, based on what you were saying, and just on a rational idea of what would be necessary, you can envisage that the number of viruses needed to infect and that do infect is much less than in a case of Ebola, which has a very short infectious cycle and very acute infection versus these other chronic infections."

I love that phrase. And I had done an episode a few weeks back with Chinmay Tumbe about the pandemics India has been struck by and that has a lot about cholera as well. And it's it's so fascinating to sort of see that all this has played out before, you know, at least the bad parts of it has played out before we have never had, you know, so many vaccines within a year. And the kind of science work that is happening is sort of remarkable. So a follow on question from there that assuming that this is kind of close to optimal, that it is both infectious and lethal, I would have thought that just logically, like, where is the flaw in my thinking that, you know, that logically it would like many viruses have done of the past also, including, I think, influenza strains, that it would naturally evolve towards becoming more infectious and less lethal. Because, you know, that would seem to be the natural consequence. It seems kind of counterintuitive that it can become both more infectious and more lethal or even as lethal. So what are we seeing right now? Like here we are actually talking in April. And obviously, your book is actually remarkably up to date, given when it came out that it talks about all the vaccines and the British variant and all that. But what we are seeing, for example, right now in India, it would seem just looking at the raw numbers and it's evolving. So the whole picture could look different five days from now, and I have no way of telling. But just from a layman's perspective, just looking at sort of the data, it seems that cases have gone up massively, but the death rate hasn't quite gone up to the same extent. Is it possible that it is a strain that is more infectious and less lethal, which, I mean, you would kind of expect? Or, you know, are there nuances here? Are there other possibilities that we and obviously, I realized that nobody knows right now, we are still in a sense in the fog of war. But what's your kind of take on that?"

So let's say you get vaccinated, or you get infected, or you have an asymptomatic infection that you don't know about, you may have antibodies and you may have T cell responses, that when you have that second reinfection, it's not as severe anymore. So there are these two sets of factors that are determining what that is. And maybe in a number of people, they didn't know that they were infected the first time. And in those cases, they are actually having reinfections. The point that you made about previous pandemics is actually quite a good one. And with H1N1, which happened in 1918 and 1919, because that was such a deadly and dominant virus. One thing is that every single virus, even the ones that circulate within human populations right now, and then cause seasonal influenza, apart from the ones that are causing bird flu and are not transmitting very well, and they just come every few years with different variants. But all of the circulating influenza A strains right now, are in some manner derived from that H1N1 of 1918 and 1919. And there is a theory, it isn't very well substantiated, that one of the human coronaviruses, there are human coronaviruses that cause colds, may have caused a pandemic in the 1800s. And then it just became very, very mild over time. What we are seeing now with SARS-CoV-2, it's still too early right now. And a large proportion of the world has not even been infected once. So we will know this. And that is actually how the pandemic ends. The pandemic doesn't end because SARS-CoV-2 gets eradicated. It ends because either through vaccination or either through different variants, it becomes into a mild disease that we no longer have to worry about anymore."

And most of the time they won't even enter our cells and most of the time when they do, nothing will really go wrong. So we won't even notice it. So this is kind of a selection bias that we give viruses a bad name by picking on the ones that actually do serious damage to us. What do we know about the origins of the Corona virus? Like in the sense that, you know, you've spoken about how, you know, what we took seriously earlier was the influenza virus, which is 1918 and the Hong Kong flu in the late 60s and the mid 50s and whatever. So you've had the flu virus around a long time that also uses RNA replication, but you've pointed out that there are some differences and no one really took Corona viruses seriously. Perhaps when the first SARS came, which you said, you know, at that point you were active in the profession and you kind of thought about it and wrote about it. That's when people started taking it seriously. What, you know, how are Corona viruses different from say the influenza virus? You know, how do they originate? What's the whole deal? And how did this particular, how did SARS-CoV-2, what are the theories about the origin and how it kind of reached humans?"

        "message": "Yeah, as I mentioned, there are a certain number of, there are four Corona viruses that cause common colds in humans. Two of them were discovered a few decades ago and nobody really paid that much attention to Corona viruses. There was a perspective in science that I mentioned in the book with respect to a scientific meeting where the total number of people attending a meeting on Corona viruses could not fill an entire room. They were like empty seats. There were so many empty seats. There were so few people at that time working on Corona viruses. And this was before SARS basically hit the scene. And so Corona virology at that time was considered one of the backwaters of virology. There weren't that many people working on this obscure class of viruses. And obviously after that, what happened is the first SARS pandemic happened in the first part of this century. And SARS spread to a number of other countries. It was fairly lethal. It was much more lethal in general than the current Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2. But as we were discussing, because many of the people or actually most of the people who were spreading the disease, most of the people who spread the virus did so after they were showing signs of disease, it was much easier to isolate it. So there weren't that many silent infections. And after a while, in the summer, the disease basically died down. It hasn't been eradicated. It could pop up at any time, but officially there hasn't been an outbreak. And then after that Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS first appeared in cannibals in the Middle East, that one also like SARS is thought to have originally originated from bats. Now bats for some unknown reason, and I have some theories in the book, as it might pertain to flight and the stresses and strains of flights in bats. Bats are mammals that do fly, harbour a disproportionate number of Corona viruses that don't cause any severe disease in them. And so MERS definitely spread from camels to people. It was very deadly, but it was not very infectious. And so with respect to the current Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, the original reservoir animal is almost certainly a bat. Now whether it came directly from bats many years ago, and then went through the process of mutation to become more infectious is one theory. And that may have happened over a few decades where it wasn't causing a very severe infection, wasn't causing very severe disease, and then it wasn't infecting very well, but it gained some mutations because of the natural selection pressures that we mentioned, and then it exploded at one time. That is definitely a plausible theory, and that is in line with what we're seeing with some of the variants as well. That happens quite frequently. The other thing about Corona viruses is that two Corona viruses can infect a cell at the same time. Influenza viruses do this as well, but their genetic material is actually broken into pieces. So when they enter a cell, they can actually mix and match pieces and create a totally new virus. Corona virus is not broken into pieces, but it can take parts from other viruses, other Corona viruses that infect the same cell. So very early on, there was this theory that there was an intermediate pangolin host. So a pangolin had been infected by a bat Corona virus, and so a pangolin and a bat Corona virus entered the same cell. They mixed and matched pieces, and one of the parts of the current Corona virus is very, very similar to a pangolin Corona virus, and that's the part that's useful or essential for binding to the receptor. That's the receptor binding domain. And so that theory has also been put out there, and definitely an intermediate animal has precedent in what is thought to have happened with the original SARS, with civets being thought to be the original, civets thought to be the intermediate animal in that case. So which of these two theories is correct is not known at the time. Formally, I know a lot of people like this theory, formally we cannot still rule out that there was a viral escape from any lab, but viral manipulation or manipulation is, does not have to be, I mean, going by Occam's razor, that's not the simplest answer. And when we see that we are infected by these viruses, then it does happen naturally. And there are a large number of Corona viruses in bats. And even before this pandemic, there were scientists like Vineet Menachery and Ralph Baric who were saying that there are Corona viruses we need to look at and watch out for because they can infect human cells. With all of these lines of evidence, I don't think at the present, we need to entertain the idea that this was created in a lab in Wuhan."

Any random one can mutate and do something and come to humans and do something far worse. And as far as pangolins are concerned, I like this is one of my favorite names for a living creature. It's like, you know, Middle Eastern martial arts warrior, you know, you can make a graphic novel on the pangolins fighting for the survival of the species. No, actually, pangolins are scaly anteaters. And yeah, so somehow bats and pangolins partied and this is and earlier, you know, you mentioned RNA as being much more promiscuous than DNA, at which point I thought that in India, then DNA would be looked upon as much more sanskari than RNA, which is merrily mixing all over the place, which is by the way, what we indeed used to do in India until, you know, a while back, Tony Joseph's book and his episode with me has much more. So now, what I kind of find interesting about it and where this current outbreak in a sense has come at the right time, like I think that if it came 40 years ago, we would have no idea what to do with it. It could have been you could argue it would be less devastating because global travel was less and therefore it may not have proliferated so fast. But there would have been some point in time where global travel would have been you know, frequent enough for a big enough for it to spread fast, but the science wouldn't have gotten to where it was. And this time what you've sort of spoken about is that in January itself, we had sort of the genetic sequence of, you know, SARS-CoV-2 and already people began working on a vaccine as far back as then, which is one of the reasons that it's kind of come so far. So tell me about what happens to the scientific community? What happened to the scientific community last year when this sort of erupted? Because like you said earlier, you wouldn't fill a room with people studying the coronavirus. And now it's just an existential threat to all of us. So everybody's kind of on it.

At that time, there was no RT-PCR diagnostic test.

It is scary that we are finding variants, but we are finding variants because we are able to look for variants, and we're able to sequence hundreds of 1000s of genomes fairly quickly. We would not have known about that in the past. So, so the science at that level, and that's because of, of next generation sequencing, and the both the cost of that has gone down, and the speed and accuracy of that is, is just mind blowing from that respect. With respect to vaccines, also, the platforms that are available now with all the molecular platforms and the RNA platform, a number of things had to happen to be able to make the RNA stable and to be able to deliver that because RNA is a fairly unstable molecule. And to be able to deliver that and the seminal papers happened just a few years before this mRNA vaccine came out for or these two mRNA vaccines, the Pfizer one and the Moderna one came out last year and were shown to have fantastic efficacy. And so, again, I mentioned the history of that and that was definitely a perfect storm of that. One other aspect of this is we were just talking about the structural biology, but the spike protein was the structure of the spike protein was determined very, very quickly because there were a couple of labs, Jason McClellan being one, who had identified the structure of the MERS coronavirus spike protein. And he used a very ingenious technique of basically stapling it with two molecules, two building blocks, which are known as prolines. So he used two prolines to be able to stabilize it and and he knew that trick. And that trick was utilized in the design of three of the vaccines that seemed to be working very well, the Pfizer, the Moderna and the J&J vaccine. So all of these things happened. Most people are not aware of them and perhaps they don't need to be aware of them. But you are absolutely right. And now that these platforms have been shown to work, that we know that we can go through trials in such a rapid manner, they will be used for other viruses and for other infectious diseases. But also the pace by which these booster shots can now be created for any variants of concern is also quite spectacular. And that's definitely on the scientific front. On the non-scientific front, just the technology that has advanced over the past few years, and has allowed us to work from home and even have this conversation, this didn't exist, the Wi-Fi, the broadband, none of this existed, even 10 years ago at the level that people could work from home in large numbers. And then finally, I will point out the information on the internet where people can actually look at cases in their own area. And information can sometimes be paralyzing, but I always feel that it's better to know than the alternative and then to be ignorant. And to be able to see the cases in the area, the measures that are being taken in real time. This is the first pandemic of that, of the flattening the curve, so as to speak. And all of these things happened at this time, it would not have been possible in any previous pandemic."

        "message": "Yeah, it's so stunning. And I couldn't agree with you more about, you know, that even this conversation would not have been possible 10 years ago, we may not have known of each other. You know, you may never have written the book because who knows, you know, to sort of just be asked by a publisher who's looking at your tweets and saying, huh, this guy knows what he's talking about. So it's quite remarkable. But it's also a thought that, you know, as you mentioned earlier, that not everybody has this. I mean, if you just for example, you know, we take the internet so much for granted, the people in Kashmir went so many months without it, you know, and for us, it's like oxygen, we can't imagine life without it. At one point in this book, you talk about how these viruses that cause respiratory diseases are a problem, because you said, I think I'm quoting from memory here, quote, breathing is not optional, stop quote. And in a similar sense, I think for many of us who are now used to it and take it for granted, the internet is something like that. Before I kind of move on to my next question, I also want to sort of, you know, you mentioned the structure again, another line that I was struck by from the book about what the virus does about, you know, the way it's looking to fit into a cell is that at one point, you wrote, quote, a virus is like a thief going from one house to another with one key, trying to see what it can open with it, stop quote, which is a stunning line, like, you know, I'm going to, you know, show this to my writing students as an example of show don't tell about how, you know, just with one visual, you make so much so clear. And at another point, another line of yours that I loved, was when you talk about how we can't make out the colour of the virus, and contrary to the popular depictions of it, which is red and all that. And you say, quote, SARS-CoV-2 does not look like a lychee, stop quote. So all this is, you know, and the book is full of stuff like this. So for anyone who's listening, you know, just kind of pick up the book, you'll read it in one sitting and hopefully, you know, gift it to all your friends, because everyone needs to know this stuff. So my next question is about what does this virus do within the body? Because even that some someplace where our knowledge has been evolving, and perhaps the virus has also been evolving, but our knowledge has been evolving, like, it's not just a respiratory thing. It's, you know, it does so many different things it, you know, the symptoms are, can be different, they can be respiratory, they can be fever, they can be gastrointestinal, where it, like you pointed out, it attaches to the, you know, ACE2 receptors within those particular tracts. And it causes blood clotting. And sometimes a virus doesn't kill you, the immune system does with, you know, what are called cytokine storms, which you also described and explained so well in your book. Give me a picture of what happens, you know, what are the different things that the virus does within the body? And what are those things which, you know, make it so much more lethal, and so much more something we should worry about than some of the previous sort of viruses"

        "message": "of this sort? Yeah, so in a lot of asymptomatic people, and those who have very, very mild infection, the extent of the virus spread is basically the nose and the upper respiratory tract. And they are still infectious, because when they are sneezing, when they are breathing, those virus particles, at least in the early part of the infection, they are, they are, they're coming out from their nose and their mouth and their throat. After a while, the virus though, it goes in certain people. So that may be the extent of infection in a lot of people who are spreading the disease. In other people, though, then the virus goes down into into the delicate parts of the lungs, and then infects there. And that's when the disease starts to get more severe. And we have people who need oxygen, sometimes ventilation as well. And from that point, once it goes down there, and then the immune response starts with the hyperactive immune response, and the cytokine storms, that's when it becomes almost a battle. And then from there, the virus can go through the bloodstream and infect other parts of the body as well. And this is sort of has been a moving target. At first, everyone, as you mentioned, thought it was a respiratory virus. But now it's known to infect various other parts of the body as well. It's been definitely found, even in the nervous system. And, and even it's thought to be found in parts of the brain, and is responsible for this aspect of long COVID now, which is also referred to as post COVID syndrome, in which people are having mental effects of this. In addition to the the loss of smell that's happening, there are GI tract disturbances, as well in a number of people. Early on, it was thought that it was spread a lot through through fecal matter. That does not seem to be the case. Early on, it was thought to be spread a lot through surfaces and surface contamination. That now is thought to be minor and surface cleaning and decontamination does not have to be as much as it is before. But basically, you are right, it can in the first stage, it's in the upper part of the respiratory tract, then it goes down to the lower part of the respiratory tract. And then there is this, this hyper immune response stage as well, that that happens in people. And because of this, because it's such a moving target, there is no single drug that is a magic bullet. Because in the early part of the stage, what you're trying to do is you're trying to stop viral replication. But later on, you're actually trying to slow down your immune response. You don't want to slow down your immune response at the first part of the infection, because then it might get to become more life threatening as well. And then what happens is if you use a lot of the antivirals towards the last part of the last part of the disease, then it's it's not as effective anymore, either. Most antivirals work very well in the early part of the infection."

And we'll come back to that later. And part of that is just state capacity, both intellectual capacity and your actual manpower and all that. But, you know, if we move away from policy to the scientific response, one, there has been some remarkable science happening in all these really different vaccines coming out. And we'll discuss that in detail as well. But as far as the treatment is concerned, it seems that what was thrown at the disease to begin with, were blunt tools in the sense that they were things that might have worked in the past for, you know, other viruses, or I think remdesivir was tried during Ebola and didn't really work even there. And there are, you know, even though everyone in India is talking about shortage of it, it's still, you know, trials haven't really shown that it even works. There still seems to be this massive fog, people have tried drugs of the past, people have thrown all kinds of quackery at the problem. What's been the reason for that, that when science quickly figured out structure, and, you know, genetic code, and all of that, all of those things, and came out with all these incredible vaccines, why is it so difficult to treat when it actually gets going? And what are the sort of the different methods that have been tried and that haven't worked? And, and here, it seems that it is almost like science in the battlefield. It's not like you're doing science in a lab, you're doing science in a battlefield where every day, you know, medics are also coping with the pressure of trying to figure a way out this, this shit then gets politicized. Because if Trump says hydroxychloroquine is the answer, then everyone, you know, gets on that bandwagon. Where is the science on it? Why is this aspect, you know, so difficult?"

        "message": "And that's one thing that I worry about as well is that when the next pandemic strikes, if it is a respiratory virus, if we don't have a medicine cabinet of drugs, if we don't have a way to develop vaccines very quickly, if we don't have pan coronavirus vaccines and pan influenza vaccines in the future, then we will be stuck with a similar situation just like this, where the tools at the start of the pandemic are very blunt instruments, such as the measures that were taken during 1918 and 1919. And even before that, with lockdowns and quarantines and school closures and, and businesses closures and masks and things like that. They are effective, but you are absolutely right. They are not very precise tools. They are very blunt instruments. And part of that is that it takes really a long time to develop drugs longer than to develop vaccines. Vaccines can use these platforms and they can, they can be created in at least what we noticed in this case, they can be created in a shorter amount of time. So all the drugs that we have for this were repurposed from previous diseases and for other, other outcomes and they're used as other treatments. And so what we have here is that drugs that were not designed for this particular virus. So we know all the structure, we know what the function is. And now we are at the stage that a number of these drugs are in phase one and some of them are, I believe are in phase two as well, where they will be available. So, but you can see it's taken over a year and in pandemic terms, that is not acceptable as, as far as I see it. So we do need to build up a set of other broadly applicable or broadly usable drugs for future pandemics that, that target some of these specific targets that we know to be existing for RNA viruses. The problem with that, and I've mentioned this elsewhere is, is a lot of the incentives and a lot of the economic aspects of creating a drug where it takes a few hundred million dollars to actually get a drug. And it takes many years to go through and run the entire gauntlet of trials to get the drugs out there. But when there isn't a pandemic, there is no demand for that drug. So there, you cannot price the drug to actually even recoup your costs. So I think the description of this that's been used, and I like it a lot, is that no one really values the fire extinguisher until there's a fire. So how are you going to price that fire extinguisher? How are you actually going to go through the research and development process to make that? And my hope is that now with this pandemic, people will see this as a serious threat to human populations in the future, and there will be public investment. I think there has to be a certain level of public investment in many of these drugs for the future. And so when the next pandemic invariably hits, we will be better prepared to respond with drugs at the outset."

        "message": "Yeah, no, that's a great point. The incentives problem is massive. And it's something that I've also addressed in my past episodes, that if you think back at a politician, say, 10 years ago, you know, if he spends a ton of money preparing for something that does not happen, you know, there's so many other things he could do with that money, there's so much opportunity cost, how do you even and politicians have short lifespans in terms of there is always the electoral cycle, they're always looking at the next election. So spend the money on something that will help them get those votes, rather than, you know, spend on the unseen, you know, preventing a pandemic, because if you if you're too successful, no, you know, people will think, hey, why did he kind of do all that spending, and hopefully this pandemic will sort of be like a reality check and push for more of that. So it's not so bad the next time around. Tell me now about the vaccines, because I remember, you know, up till a few months ago, you had, you know, scientists and doctors and all of that going on air and saying entirely plausibly, that listen, there has never been a vaccine for any Coronavirus. For example, though, you've pointed out in your book that in animals that has but I think, but not in none of the ones that affect humans, that scientists have been trying for decades to find a vaccine for HIV, and they haven't succeeded, we may never have a vaccine. And, and now we have so many vaccines, and they're all so different. And they're all remarkable. And you know, with the mRNA ones, it seems like they're kind of, you know, designed on a computer. It's just like miraculous. Take me a little bit, I mean, you know, share a little bit of the wonder of what has just happened, and which I think most normal people just don't get that what a freaking miracle it is almost."

And definitely, so I have a friend who works for one of the major vaccine manufacturers for the mRNA vaccine. And he and I converse quite a bit on Twitter, he, he reviewed a certain number of chapters of this book. And we were just talking about it the other day that even I don't think anyone expected the those vaccines to work as well as they did. If you recall, the initial efficacy target was anything above 50% efficacy will be approved if it and the the endpoint that they use was because they wanted to lessen the severity of disease and hospitalizations and death was was basically symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease. But now if you tell anyone you have to take a 50% efficacy vaccine, nobody will take it. Everyone is talking about even AstraZeneca, which has been remarkably successful in in halting the number of cases in the UK and saying I don't want to take that vaccine because there are now vaccines with with 95% efficacy that that have been created. And in this case, this has happened because the spike protein was relatively a soft target for for the immune system and in terms of the antibodies and the T cell responses that were possible. With the case of HIV, HIV is so elusive. If you think about the variants that we have, you can think about HIV as variants times a million or even times a few few million in that you're not actually looking at even one one virus that you can create as a certain set of immune responses to you're you're looking at a whole galaxy of viruses under that HIV umbrella. So in this case, we were quite lucky in that there was basically, essentially one virus. And we were also lucky that when the predominant strain changed, there was one mutant that became predominant in the middle of 2020. Most people didn't care about it because it wasn't that much more infectious and all the vaccines seem to work against it. We definitely got quite lucky, although it remains to be seen now like how long that immunity lasts for. It could be anywhere from I suspect it would be in the order of at least a year.

And you said earlier in this episode that, you know, the science is the easiest part of many problems to solve. You know, there's all this other stuff that is happening.

        "message": "feelings on this? It is incredibly frustrating to see this. And I saw this play out over the course of the last year. And in an over, over time, as I've lived in the United States, you here you have this country, which in terms of the scientific output, and in terms of scientific and medical advances, is definitely one of the countries at the forefront. And you see this in terms of the research, the guidance, even the CDC plan, they had a pandemic preparedness plan for just this kind of situation. And then on the other hand, you see this, this subset of people, who regardless of what is presented to them, live in this post truth world where ideology dictates what they believe, and that has real world and, and consequences on people's lives. I mean, at this time 550,000 people have died in this country of a largely preventable disease. I'm not saying that, that people would not have died. But so many people did not have to die in this country. And that definitely is infuriating. And from that perspective, I will say yes, that it is a failing of society in general. And maybe we don't inculcate enough critical thinking, or maybe we don't, we don't see things from the perspective of the broader holistic view. And we're thinking more in terms of our group and our community and our own selfish needs and our desires and beliefs. But that is something that definitely will need to be solved. And I think in 2021, one of the big issues of this year is going to be around vaccination. Inequality definitely plays a part with some countries having received very few doses of the vaccine. And those might be breeding grounds for future variants as well. But even within India, you see like this dichotomy right now of people, a lot of people, mainly urban, mainly educated, mainly middle class to upper middle class or even rich, who want vaccines and are now queuing up and demanding that they receive vaccines. And a large number of people who are unaware of what these vaccines might do to prevent severe disease, who have somehow, who are somehow under this notion that this, this pandemic is not really a big deal or wasn't even a big deal. They don't see these variants as causing any future disease and are really more scared of the vaccines than they are of the, of the disease, of the virus and of the variants. And so I see this as a communications breakdown to both sets of people. I mean, the communications have to be different to both groups of people. You have to communicate and have outreach to people to convince them to take the vaccine. And in that case, it can be sort of a heavy handed way of pushing people or, or, or lathi charging them and forcing them to take vaccines or even financial incentives always tend to backfire because people think that there is something wrong with the vaccine. That's why I'm getting paid to get the jab. So that's, that's the type of outreach that, that definitely hasn't happened to that extent. And then the other outreach of having a clear and consistent vaccine policy as to when people will be receiving vaccines for those people who actually want them right now.

        "message": "definitely a mess. Yeah. I mean, I've heard so many crazy things about vaccine that I like, I don't even know how to respond. Like one person I know said that they might as well put boiled water in the vaccine. It doesn't make a difference. Another person said that the vaccines are causing the second wave. A third person said that the reason the second wave is happening is because the money bags behind the vaccines want you to get the vaccine. So you have these ridiculous sort of theories going around. Now, another thing I want to kind of explore and it's something that I've been thinking about is how differently a public policy people on the one hand and scientists on the other hand may explore the question of truth and evidence. For example, you know, for a lot of public policy, there is no definitive evidence because you can't do a controlled experiment. Like my friend Shruti Rajgopalan once sort of gave a great analogy. She said that imagine that you want to find out whether dropping a coin in water displaces water or not, right? Does the water level go up or down? Simple enough to do. Now in a lab, obviously you can just take two beakers and put the coin in one of them and you can measure it and everything is controlled. But imagine doing it in a swimming pool where you put the coin in the swimming pool and you try to see what's happening. And there is no way of getting a meaningful result. And there are just so many other factors, so many variables that come into play. And you don't know counterfactuals either. You know, now I see this that, you know, a public policy people may therefore come from an ideological lens. And you know, and it's really interesting how the ideological lens affects how people look at certain measures like lockdowns. So people on the right over here because Modiji did the lockdown, were with the lockdown. But in the US, it was just the opposite where because Trump did not want a lockdown, they were like, you know, we don't need a lockdown and all of that. Now the thing with a lockdown is that you can never actually get evidence, evidence on whether it worked or not. You simply don't know the counterfactuals. Forget every country being different from each other. Every district is different from each other. Bandra is different from Andheri. You cannot possibly do a controlled experiment or have any sense of whether something worked or not. So in public policy, you're handling all these variables. In science, you're not. Now, what I see is that both of these sort of lenses of looking, which are perfectly valid lenses in their specific fields, that a public policy person always has to believe that even if the evidence appears to be for him, it may not be. Correlation may not be causation. There are so many other factors involved. Nothing is definite. But taking this lens to science becomes a huge problem and vice versa. That if science people are always, you know, that what works, what doesn't work, we want a clear answer. There has to be a clear answer. There has to be a way to design a clear answer that wouldn't work. Now, one example of the former kind where, you know, people within politics or policy take that sort of lens where the truth is kind of up for grabs and it's a narrative that matters that can really affect the response. Like just a couple of days ago, our Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said something about homeopathy must be encouraged and the Ministry of Ayush. And I've written about them in the past. Even in your book, you talk about, for example, how so many people don't get the importance of double blind, randomized control trials. And it's not just that people think homeopathy works because of the placebo effect. They also think it works because, and like you've pointed out in your book and I've written about it in columns in the past, that many diseases will just revert to the mean, that you'll be bad, you'll be bad for a while and then you get better and people will ascribe that and give credit to the medicine and all of that. And once they believe in a particular medicinal system, it almost becomes an ideological thing. And then the confirmation bias kicks in. And when it appears to work, they'll be like, wow. And when it doesn't work, they'll be like, whatever, it could have been worse. And all this shit happens. So but the fundamental question is about these conflicting mindsets, where some people take the mindset to science, where they don't realize that there are definite truths out there. And all science is a quest to get closer and closer to that you never absolutely know everything. And similarly, there can be an attitude, which is not a science attitude, more an engineering attitude, perhaps, where, you know, that where people will believe that all society can be fixed from the top down, and we can find the right answer for everything. Is this something that you've thought about or noticed?"

        "message": "I have and I think you expressed some of the limitations of each of these approaches. Each of these approaches quite succinctly, definitely with respect to drugs and the confirmation bias, but that applies to anything that we look at. Retrospectively, we can look at previous pandemics and say, okay, this is we should have prepared for this, because something in this pandemic was is very similar to this. And we can say, no, this pandemic is absolutely different from every other pandemic, because these other additional aspects are different. So we will, the observer will find out what he or she seeks and confirm that bias with any type of retrospective analysis. With any type of forward looking analysis with a very heterogeneous and large system with so many variables and unknowns, basically stochastic processes, it becomes extremely, extremely difficult. I think the keys here are to basically before the experiment is to set what the objectives are. If you're going to institute a lockdown, what is the objective that you want for that lockdown? And you can't change that or shift the goalpost halfway through or not make that clear. That has to be absolutely transparent for any public policy initiative. And that has to be known to the public as well, to get their buy in to get their involvement in that as well. And once they know the threat of the disease, what the goals of that public policy outcome are. And then so in that sense, pragmatically, if you take an approach, and things don't turn out as badly as the model, then that's good. And why it exactly happened is not necessarily relevant. I mean, there's a parable involving the Buddha and it says, basically, there was someone who had been struck with an arrow. And when the person is struck with an arrow, he wants that arrow removed and he wants to get better. So all the processes of how that happens and why that happens that can come at a later date. That does not necessarily appeal to me as a scientist, where I always feel uncomfortable with not knowing. And I always feel that there are too many uncertainties around that. And I saw that when the pandemic curve, the epidemic curve went down for India, and everyone was saying, well, the pandemic is over. And I said, well, it will take time to figure this out to tease out why this happened. And we cannot say that it happened because of any one favorite reason or any one favorite hypothesis until we figure it out. Because the exact opposite reason can contribute to a resurgence as well. And now we've seen a resurgence and there are many conflicting reasons as to why it happened. It could be any one of them, it could be all of them. But again, that will take time. So science sometimes takes as you mentioned, it takes time to figure out answers. And in that sort of fog of war, we don't have time to tease out what those answers might be. In that case, so what do we do? I think there are some models that we can apply. Now, as George Box said, all models are wrong, but some models are useful. So we have to figure out which model is actually useful for the parameter that we want. And again, as he said, all models are wrong, because a model is inherently based on the parameters of that model, and, and the the variables and the constraints that you impose upon it. And it has to be for something as large and and as, as drawn out as this, it has to be extremely reductionist. It can only have a few variables. Otherwise, we're going to, but in the real world is is very full of chaos and of instances like the butterfly effect. So we don't know what, what changes early on determine and that's the case even with the trajectory of a pandemic. We don't know what could have stopped the pandemic early on when it hit the scene in Wuhan. And were there things that could have been done at that time that could have changed the trajectory of the pandemic. So certain events definitely play a part in that. And no model can can account for that. So I have thought of that. And I that's why I give you this, this long winded rambling answer that doesn't really get to answering it properly."

        "message": "Oh, it's a lovely answer. And sometimes, you know, just asking the right questions and teasing out the question is more important than finding an answer. And by the way, for the many, many, many, many fashion model friends I have, I wish to validate your existence and say that some of you are useful. And, you know, getting back to what you said about the butterfly effect and chaos theory, and sometimes we don't know, and it strikes me that these words we don't know, are actually so important for so many of us to internalize. We are always so desperate to tell stories to ourselves, or, you know, get stories from elsewhere, which explain everything, and everything can't quite be explained. So in this context, before I get to my next question, I want to read out a great quote by Douglas Adams, which I love. This is Douglas Adams quote, imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, this is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it. Now the puddle stop quote, Adams continues, this is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky, and the air heats up, and as gradually the puddle gets smaller and smaller, is still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this world was meant to have a minute was built to have a minute. So the moment he disappears, catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something that we need to be on the watch out for. And my question goes back to, you know, something we discussed earlier in another context, which is humility. And here, it's humility about our species, that we tend to believe that we are masters of the universe, we have sorted everything out. I have heard elsewhere that we are basically colonized by bacteria, bacteria are the masters of the universe. In a different context, you could say that hey, viruses were possibly there before and they rule the roost and everything is contingent, existence is contingent. And everything is so fragile. And if anything over the last year, we should have got a greater sense of that and therefore developed more humility and perhaps a compassion that comes with more humility. And so what, and it seems to me that scientists would have the closest view of this, because you guys actually, you know, every day confronting all those, all these miracles of nature, and realizing how small a place, you know, we play in the universe. What are your sort of thoughts on this?"

I am constantly, I'm constantly amazed by how long humans live, considering the amount of abuse we put on our bodies through our entire lives, and how much we disrespect ourselves and all the things that we do. I mean, life itself is absolutely fascinating for me. And what you said definitely resonates with me, it strikes a chord. And this is where I disagree with some other experts like Harari, who wrote in Homo Deus, that there is this arc of progress where humans will continue to progress. But as you mentioned, a lot of it is just like so much dependent on random events. Our species could have been wiped out so many times in the past. And there are these pieces of evidence now that you can look at from a scientific perspective. And I think Tony Joseph, whose book you mentioned, he mentions a certain number of them. But there are others as well, where humanity could have been wiped out at any moment in the past, as when we were, when our ancestors were in Africa, when they were coming out of Africa. And even more recently, during the Cold War, when we were at the brink of mutual destruction between the superpowers, the world could have ended at that point. And just the fact that it didn't end doesn't mean that it had to be that way, as you so eloquently said, using that puddle analogy."

And in fact, if you think about it, you know, the law of truly large numbers tells you that the universe will end one day, it is incredibly inevitable. I mean, the law of truly large numbers, by the way, is different from the law of large numbers. For my listeners, the law of truly large numbers says that if there are enough iterations of something, then no matter how unlikely the you know, the unlikeliest event is inevitable to take place, if there are enough iterations. I once wrote a column on this in the context of poker, where the I think the headline of the column was in unlikely is inevitable, that if you understand the law of truly large numbers, you realize that you can't take anything for granted. There's so much luck in everything. So you know, I've taken a lot of your time. And what I had actually planned to do was talk about each chapter of your book one by one. But now I realized that that'll take another five or six hours, because there are such, such depth to the book. So we won't do that. So I'll just ask kind of a couple of general questions before we end. And the first of the general questions is this, that how will this impact on medical sciences done in future going ahead? Because like, is this sort of an inflection point for where maybe in terms of focus on how we do things differently, or maybe just in terms of how a lot of the other science, like, you know, understanding genetics, like even AI and medicine, which Eric Topol has written about so much, how were we at a turning point anyway? And has this accelerated the turning point? Moving ahead? What can we expect? Like one of the things that I keep hearing about, and I wonder what your much more informed view on that would be, is about how one day we can stop aging or reverse aging, which sounds wonderful to me, because, you know, I was happier being young than middle aged, but I'd rather not be old. What are your views on that? And in general, going forward, you know, what's the state medical sciences in and, you know, do you think we'll be better prepared for the"

        "message": "next pandemic? I definitely hope that we are better prepared for the next pandemic. And I think, at least with certain aspects, people will be more quick to, if it is a respiratory virus than to wear masks and to socially distance. We certainly understand the parlance, we everyone knows a lot more about viruses than they did a year ago. And I think that's definitely a positive science is moving at breakneck speed, there is a lot more funding and realization in the world. One of the things that we noticed is that, again, maybe it's a confirmation bias on my part, but some of the countries that dealt with the first wave of the virus were ones that were not prepared during the SARS epidemic a few years ago. So their populations were very quick to wear masks, and were more compliant of some of the measures that were taken. Whether or not that there's a sort of a causal relationship there, I don't know. But that's just a very interesting observation. With respect to science and aging, that's a fantastic topic and one that I've been looking at myself as populations age over time. And it's something that we can go on about is basically around the 1800s onwards, we have added, most of the world has added about three decades to our lives, through basic hygiene, through antibiotics, and through modern medicine now. And now so we can see most of us will be able to see our children grow up, most of our children will survive into adulthood and see some of our grandchildren as well, which was not possible for most of humanity during our history. I don't think most people realize what an amazing achievement that is to be able to do that within less than 150 years. Now the next milestone is increasing that and making sure that people not only live longer, but actually have a very good health span where they are healthy during most of their life. And so that was actually been a Faustian bargain in the sense that most of the world does not worry about diseases that cause infant mortality and infectious diseases. But on the other hand, there are diseases now of progressively older people that are becoming more prevalent, like heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinsonism, that are affecting the quality of life. So if you live longer, at one point, everyone has to die, and they have to die of something. If you live longer, the diseases that you will die of are different than the diseases then you would have died of perhaps 150 or 200 years ago. What will happen in terms of society and how society responds once the pandemic is over is much, much harder to predict. On the one hand, I am hopeful that people will take infectious diseases more seriously. There will be more interest in science and in medicine. But on the other hand, I am also disheartened by the fact that even when certain countries are seeing that the pandemic is raging on in other parts of the world, where millions of people are infected and thousands of people are dying, they are immediately eager to move on and to just say that that's not my problem. And that sort of lack of foresight is not going to help us when we deal with a number of the major problems that face humanity right now. And I say right now because they are staring at us in the face in the next 10, 20 years. We are at the tipping point of climate change, deforestation, extinction of species. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics is going to cause a resurgence of antibiotic resistant superbugs. And all of this is happening right now. And they will require a longer term focus and more investment in science. But it depends on, I'm an optimistic person, but it depends on the day and what I'm seeing in the world around me. I'm not convinced that people take problems that are not immediate as seriously as they should."

        "message": "Thank you so much. I'm not done, by the way, in case you think it's over. My final question is to come. But my observation before my final question is about what you pointed out about, you know, I asked a question about the state of the science after the pandemic and you spoke about the state of society after the pandemic. And I think that's a fantastic subject to think about. And it's like one of the things that I think has happened and it's not a good sign is that the relationship between the society and the state has shifted to kind of favour the state over this period of time where, you know, the state is asserting more and more of its control. You see random rent seeking happening over things like whether people are wearing a mask when sitting alone in a car, you see more of state control, more authoritarianism, you know, and one wonders whether, you know, freedoms taken away never kind of get, you know, it never gets rolled back, it never comes back. So one has to sort of think about that. But here's my last question that, you know, where we are sitting in April, we are still kind of in a fog of war. And your brilliant book, which I hope everyone listening to this reads will kind of give us a certain foundation of understanding about everything that is happening. But beyond that, even having read the book, there are still so many questions I have and questions that people have in general, such as that what exactly is happening, you know, the second wave and it's just going on and on, when is it going to end? What are the dangers? What is long COVID? Will the new normal after everything settles down be different from what life was like before? And also how should we live? Which is, you know, a deep question in terms of broader philosophical and ethical this thing, but just in this context, just in the context of COVID that, you know, we now know that a lot of the washing of hands and all of that is a little bit of security theatre because it doesn't really spread through surfaces. And, you know, even the temperature thing, you know, fever is not necessarily a ubiquitous symptom. It's not even that common, but perhaps it's okay. I don't really mind harmless bits of security theatre and all of that. But if you had to advise people on that broader question that look, COVID is not over. COVID is not 2020. It's very much 2021. It's still here with us. And like you said, we'll have to live with it forever, perhaps in hopefully in much milder forms and with our bodies better prepared for it and all of that, maybe, you know, whether an annual vaccine like the flu vaccine in some places or whatever. But in general, what would you say that there's still a lot of confusion about this? What advice would you give the non-scientist lay person like me, who is just wondering that, hey, you know, what is happening and how long and"

        "message": "what must we do to, you know, going forward? Yeah, I would say my first thing to say right now is don't worry too much. There are things in with aspects of unknown that we have to be able to deal with this uncertainty. And we have to be able to deal with this uncertainty over time and worrying does not change what is beyond our control as individuals and as participants in society. We have to think about the things that we can do, both in terms of changing our society and being valuable contributors to our society, not just in the public health realm, but beyond that in what you were saying about ensuring our liberties as well. Beyond that, I would say definitely get vaccinated when your opportunity comes. The vaccines will provide protection. You may be worried about how they do against variants. But again, science takes time. The vaccines are here now. They offer you some protection. If it is not adequate protection, then there will be booster shots, then you will take the booster shots. And so this is an ongoing thing. But you cannot, like you were mentioning Chess, it doesn't help to think about the end game all the time. Just think about maybe the next few moves and then we'll work out what the what the end game is. The variants are definitely contributing to the pandemic in various parts of the world and the resurgence. And based on what has been happening in India, we don't have the genomic data to say it with certainty. But I would say it's very, very likely that the various pandemics are causing this or are partly responsible for this new wave. And then people are obviously loosening their measures. There's another theory that people may be staying more indoors because of the warmer months. I don't know how much of these individually contribute to that. But I mean, the cases are real. The disease is real. It is serious. And long COVID, as we talked about, is something that is happening and it is real. So protect yourself. Hope for the best. Get vaccinated. The same measures that you were using in the past will be the same measures that will work for the variants as well. It's not a different virus. So conceptually, I had mentioned that you can think of people as virus factories as they're breathing out viruses in the book. So what you can think about with a variant as a very sort of simple analogy is that people are still virus factories. They're breathing out perhaps more viruses and perhaps fewer viruses need to enter your body to cause that level of disease as before. There might be more viral load and the infectious dose might be less. There could be other factors as well. But again, to simplify that, those are probably a certain number of factors that are involved in making some of the variants more infectious. But if you see that as well, you can see that the measures that you are taking, such as wearing masks and socially distancing and limiting activities indoors will continue to be important. And then the broader question about life, that is definitely a philosophical one. And I think we always have to get back to the social aspects of this and the inequalities that we have been seeing all around the world. And we saw this even with HIV. And I mentioned this even at the end of the book, that the pandemic doesn't end when it ends only for us. And my fear and worry is that even when it has ended for us and we are vaccinated and we're protected that COVID-19 becomes a disease of the underprivileged, of a disease of poverty, disease of certain parts of the world where it lingers on as a serious disease while we go on with our business."

        "message": "Wise words again. And I must clarify here to my listeners that when Anirban is saying limit indoor activity, he does not mean have all your sex in the park. What he basically means is that, listen, we know that the spread of the virus really happens indoors. It's much less outdoors. It really happens indoors, especially in air-conditioned spaces. So be careful of social gatherings and all of that, especially the current virus with the infectious levels it is at. We need to be careful. And I'll again double down on your wise advice. You know, get vaccinated, take precautions, wear a mask. You know, I love the way that, you know, in Southeast Asia, because of their past experience with, you know, pandemics and pandemic scares, it almost became a cultural thing that if you have any kind of respiratory disease, even if it's a flu, you wear a mask not to protect yourself, but out of concern for your fellow person, you know, and that's become part of the culture. And that's a beautiful thing. That is what a mask is. It is not meant to protect us as individuals, but to sort of in a sense, you know, assert our place in society that we have a responsibility for each other as well. And wearing a mask is part of that, but get vaccinated certainly. And one more thing, if I might add, kindly do hop over to your nearest bookstore online or offline and pick up Anirban's wonderful book. Anirban, thank you so much. I really love this conversation. So much I learned today."
