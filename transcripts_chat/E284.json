        "message": "So you've clicked play on this podcast and you notice that hey, this episode is over five and a half hours long. What's going on? Why does it need to be so long? People who discover this podcast for the first time often ask this question, though if they become regular listeners, they ask, why couldn't it have been longer? I wrote a post about this subject and I'll link it from the show notes. But let me talk about one aspect of it for now. When I started the show, it was about ideas and analysis. The name of this podcast, The Seen and the Unseen, was inspired by Frederic Barcia's 19th century essay, That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen. The show, like the essay it was inspired from, was supposed to be about the unintended consequences of public policy. But then it evolved. And over the last few years, the focus has shifted from ideas to people, from interviews to conversations. Initially, I'd get an expert on a subject and talk about the subject. But those are dime a dozen on YouTube and other podcasts. I gradually stepped back and began speaking about my guests' life and influences. And in recent times, some of the longer episodes are oral histories, or you could even call them assisted self portraits. When you speak to someone about the life over a span of decades, you not only understand them better, but you also get glimpses of the changing world as it turns and burns. I love that aspect of the show, being able to live someone's life as seen in flashback and self reflection. Being able to unpeel layers of this complex world we live in. And going by the love I get from all of you, it's clear that many, many people want that kind of deep discursive conversation as well. So if you're new to this, and you start listening and think, hey, get to the point, well, there is no point. That is the point. I'll end this intro by saying thank you again to all the guests who've ever been on this show and have trusted me enough to set aside their filters and open themselves up to me."

        "message": "Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is my old and dear friend Nilanjana Roy. I first met Nilanjana in my blogging days, maybe 18 or 19 years ago, when she was already one of the most highly regarded book critics in the country, and even in the world as her fame grew through the interwebs. She wrote one of the longest running book columns in the world. I think it appeared in the business standard for over two decades. She's now a columnist for the Financial Times. She's edited various compilations. She's written two fabulous books of fantasy called The Wildings and The Hundred Names of Darkness. Her first literary novel for adults Black River is due out soon. That's a biography. What can I tell you about her? Well, one of the things that I admire about Nilanjana is what a good reader she is. She reads a lot. She reads well. She reads with intention. Her reading deepens her sense of self and informs how she looks at the world and writes about it. This is something I've always wanted to learn from her. Some of this love for reading and books comes out through her superb collection of essays, The Girl Who Ate Books. I'll refer to that and quote from that during this conversation, where we spoke about reading, yes, but also about feminism, family, freedom and about these times we live in. Before we get to it, though, let's take a quick commercial break. And guess what? The commercial is also about reading. Use my code and subscribe to CTQ. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills, and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future.

We have so few shows that actually give people a little time to you know sprawl. Usually you have your eye on the clock with the conversation and you're thinking 20 minutes, four questions, 45 minutes so much. You see what I mean? And I'm going to try very hard not to be going to interviewer mode though the questions that I wanted to ask you were things like you know why why did you decide that we needed this the sprawl of time, the slowness, this getting into things, spending a fair amount of an afternoon or a morning or an evening with your guests. I've enjoyed it as a listener."

        "message": "In a very sleek way and a very slinky way you turn the tables on me but yeah to get you warmed up yeah sure this is a conversation. It sort of evolved that way in the sense that initially my sense was that you know people have short attention spans a 20 minute podcast is perfect you got to grab them in the first few seconds all of those things and I realized I was wrong for three reasons which I've sort of spoken about and written about so much in the past that it'll be a repetition for many of my listeners but the reasons being that one people tend to listen when they are a captive audience so people will listen to podcasts or audiobooks when they are either commuting or working out or doing errands like washing dishes and so on. So you know when you're watching a video on YouTube you can just go to another tab or change the window or turn your head and talk to someone who's standing there pick up a book from the table but if you're jogging you're jogging you're not going to start doing something else so one you're a captive audience two people listen at higher speeds which is easy to do because our normal speaking speed is between 150 to 200 words a minute I speak at about 160 because I'm a middle-aged man now I'm a little slow but our brain can comprehend language at 500 words a minute so actually it's really easy to listen at higher speeds and the way to do it is people might think oh it's squeaky and I'll miss nuances and all of that actually you don't at all because your brain adjusts so if you take it to 1.2 wait for it to normalize take it to 1.5 so on and so forth like I can listen to stuff between 2.5 to 3x and not lose any nuance not lose any pauses any gaps because the brain just adjusts and processes them that way and the third important reason is that I think in modern times people crave depth and the thing is it's not that there are two kinds of people in the world and the one kind has short attention span one kind doesn't I think everyone has a short attention span for a lot of the time so there might be times where I am constantly distracted and looking at my smartphone and you can't really hold my attention but there are also times where I want to sit down and go deep and media today unfortunately because there's a race to the bottom it it's it's a mile wide and an inch deep as our mutual friend Prem Panicker says so eloquently and people get that and people crave depth and they value depth which I've discovered through the love I get from my listeners and I think it's in a sense and this is a theme we'll surely talk about in your context as well but I think just shifting forms not just changes the work that you do but it also changes a person that you are it makes like for me I think I'm and I was discussing this in an episode I released I recorded yesterday with Pradeep magazine it'll probably release after this but you know and where I was talking about how it's made me less judgmental and more open to listening to people and getting involved in their stories like you know Stephen Covey once said that we don't listen to understand we listen to respond which is a really bad thing I mean to have a good conversation you have to kind of put your ego out of it and just sit down and listen and I think doing this has taught me to do that and Pradeep in different ways also shared how the last 10 years have made him much less judgmental which reflects in this beautiful memoir that he's written called not just cricket which is an episode that will come after this so people can hear that and I've been reflecting about this as well I've been you know doing a fair bit of sort of self-reflection on how the work that you do can change who you are and the work that you do is shaped so much by the form and you have also worked across different forms in your life done different kinds of reading different kinds of writing so you know although this was not something I planned specifically to ask but what are your thoughts on this"

        "message": "I'm picking up on some of the words that you've used because they are exactly what I wanted to talk about today it's that ache for depth it's not just a need for depth or a sense that we have that missing in our lives somewhere the more frantic that we get the more time we are spending on Twitter social media keeping up it's not just social media you know to be honest the world makes you feel like you have to keep running to stand still and just just to be in the swim and whether it's news or whether it's your lives there's no emphasis on pausing you know there's just you're supposed to consume one experience after the other just the way that you consume the news and there's this constant frantic cry of next next next I've spent much to my surprise I think a lifetime of moving around a lot between jobs not settling to one kind of writing one kind of job but grounded fundamentally in reading and writing I don't think I intended that to happen but it's been if you think about it this way in this ocean that's constantly tugging you this way or that way my reading in different languages different bodies of work different kinds of things has been like a sheet anchor it's something that you can return to at any point of time in your life no matter how grievous the world around you is and your reading also challenges you at some point to seek a certain kind of depth you know that libraries have long been used as parallel schools or colleges in the depression American libraries became places where people taught themselves skills and they did that by reading 30 books and on the subject and they found their subject basically by walking into this huge cathedral of books practically and asking themselves a simple question what am I curious about what am I interested in the other thing that you've touched about the fact that your work changes you I get asked so often about writing by people who see it as who used to see it at least as a pathway to a certain kind of success or celebrity or stability and they really want to have written their books and each time I want to I really want to beg them to sit down and enjoy the writing itself you know to sit there quietly with the page and with whatever you're working on and to discover yourself as a writer or discover yourself as a reader as well for me what am I doing these days I've just finished a novel Black River which is probably the first novel I've written for an entirely adult audience my two books before that the Wildings and the Hundred Names of Darkness well could go either way my youngest reader was six years old and my oldest reader was 92 years old a Spanish biker you know who sent me pictures of himself with his two cats beautiful yeah that is the joy of being a writer actually you never know who you're going to reach and if you're in a rush to get to some page three success or to get on to the TV shows or to be invited to the Jaipur Literature Festival as fun as all those things are that's not what the work is about you know and I want to tell people to to learn to take their time with whatever it is that they're doing whether it's with a book or with an author the pleasure of immersion that's the word that we are looking for really you know immersion is difficult because everything else in our modern life mitigates against it it says that when you've reached a place you need to rush to reach the other place if you've traveled to so many countries you need to go somewhere else and yet it's only by standing still and holding on whatever it is that I admire in my life whether it's specific writers specific books or whether it's the freedom struggle you know I'm struck by how much Nehru, Gandhi, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Sarojini Naidu, Aruna Asif Ali all of them how much time they actually spent thinking about what went into a national movement and trying to visualize independence Gloria Steinem I'm jumping like crazy so you'll have to call me back at some point but Gloria Steinem says that one of the tasks ahead of us is how to imagine a new world and she doesn't say you know how to bring that new world into being that's a later task or whatever but truly if you cannot imagine a better reality a better life then how you're going to reach that and you're not going to be able to get to that point if you're constantly racing from one action to another it's not just about slowing down it's about what you're slowing down for right so when you get back to your early experiences of reading often we rush into what was your first book but most people's early experiences of reading are actually of being told a story you know of listening when you're very very small very young and that is the ultimate slowness because you're sitting there you're quiet but you're not passive you're taking in something and you're learning to imagine for the first time in your very very young life this world that doesn't actually exist before your eyes I've looked at that and I think one of the big themes that I keep coming back to is why in all these centuries do we keep reaching for story why do we keep reaching for myths why is it that pretty much from the dawn of humanity one of the first things we do is not just live in the world but we reach for stories to try and explain what kind of world it is that we live in you know the oldest books and the oldest tales go back to the dawn of humanity itself and I find that incredibly moving and slightly surreal that we can sit here so many centuries later and still fully understand and be moved by something like the epic of Gilgamesh you know which was the first written epic or we can relate to the Mahabharata and the Ramayana whatever your own epics are we can relate to them as though they were written yesterday you know it's that universal people just reach across the centuries all the time with writing so a number"

        "message": "a downside so what are your sort of thoughts I'm very of nostalgia I think we all are because we tend to put an Instagram filter on the past to some extent but when I look back at my childhood the kind of childhoods that many of us had it seems impossibly idyllic because it was uncluttered I think there was extraordinary privilege for me not just in terms of caste majority religion coming from a reasonably affluent background but there was extraordinary privilege for me in the incredible luck of being born into a family where books art music and all of that were prized they were not coveted they were not collected they were just seen as these wondrous things that made your everyday duty-bound ritualistic life that much more not just enjoyable but it you know reaching for whatever it was that you were reaching for a ballet performance in Delhi, Spik Mckay concerts, your own culture in Bengali whatever it was it was understood that this added a layer of deep meaning to life and I think I was very fortunate to grow up in two households one in Calcutta one in Delhi where we were surrounded with books because people would rather collect them than refurbish the furniture I took that for granted but let me describe what a Delhi childhood was like at that time this was in a key part of the 1970s and mothers used to by and large it was a time when women were just starting to work outside the home so unfortunately most of these were mothers and mothers used to turn their children out of the house after school like puppies you know to play in open spaces and used to roam fearlessly through many of your neighborhoods and this went across class by the way this was true for small mohalla neighborhoods in model town and this was true for government colonies like Chanakya Puri where I grew up or Lodhi colony or whatever there'd be somebody sitting out on a chaat by somewhere and you'd wander around in and out of each other's houses and so the part of it that was not bookish was balanced by a tremendous activity you know I climbed trees I fell out of them I climbed roofs I fell off them this this is by the way something of a running theme in my life and I think we thought nothing of running around a space that would have been easily 10 kilometers square you know we knew every quadrangle we dreamed of secret passages in Palam airfield which was nearby we knew which parts had jackals and were to be avoided and which parts were actually a little more friendly and there was a sugarcane stand in that field that we all avoided because the Cobras used to live there and we avoided it without fear you know the natural world the bookish world the outdoors world they all flowed into and through each other even when television came in which would have been roughly the end of the 70s early 80s programs were screened in the evening and they were mind-numbingly boring to begin with yeah absolutely you know the old the golden age of television was a little further down the line when Buniyad and Humlog and all that good stuff happened so we lived a very active life not a passive life how do I struggle with this all the time I still find it difficult to avoid the stickiness of Twitter but I think I've grown better at just putting the phone off the phone is the biggest thing you know that anxiety of I'll miss out if I don't see a message right now and you have to train yourself to moving into it's fine it's fine to respond to something even three days later nothing is that urgent really you know except for okay editorial deadlines or something of the sort but even that you can train yourself to just check in with the phone once or twice a day and that opens up space for you to check in on everything else you know otherwise we spend I think what we're pushing back against is something that was also not true of the early web you know you're enough of an 80s 90s I mean I think I just touched on what a childhood in the 1970s was like an Indian childhood was never fully idyllic but you know things like the emergency which happened when I was very very young 97 98 suddenly it seemed to you that the walls were speaking in admonitory tones or because children pick up hypocrisy very fast there were these bright breezy songs you know which means remove the garbage and somewhere in there an uneasy prickle which told you even as a child that something else was supposed to be cleaned up and removed and you weren't very comfortable with what that something was you didn't know that it was people and their homes that were being removed I was born in 1971 so somewhere you know we always valorize our own births and I think in my memory my birth goes hand in hand with the story of the Bangladesh war a time when Mrs. Gandhi was probably at the height of her popularity seen as this strong and immensely capable leader and it's something of a lesson to us that just five years later she took India into its first not last experiment with authoritarianism but as a child you know what you're processing all of this in as this duality of immense security which lasted right up to the Billa Ranga murder of those two the brother and sister Geeta and Sanjay and we so used now in a huge megalopolis which is what Delhi has become and Bombay has become that we forget what a shock something like that sends out you know the ripples of sadness and shared grief and collective mourning that happens when a city is a smaller more intimate space in the 1970s Delhi was still a collection of villages held together by a substrate of government colonies and you know vague optimism again in memory it's important to just keep looking back and looking back further because nostalgia is always cut through with its opposite right so 1947 which was India's independence was remembered by the generation after that in story and in memory it was a living memory but so was partition you know and early on I think one thing we learned about living in this country we knew that because of the years of the British Empire the rule of the British Empire we knew that we didn't live in the first world we lived in the third world we knew that empirically speaking we lived in a very poor country that was struggling to fill its treasuries again and I think for my generation some of the respect for the leaders we had right after independence comes from that space it's not so much what we think of today you know worship of a particular political party or allegiance the tribal thing it is more a genuine respect and wonder for the fact that India bucked what everybody expected of the country foreign correspondents expected India to fall apart in five years and then 10 years and 15 years and you know it seemed every decade that somebody was ringing the doom in the 1980s again Indira Gandhi's assassination the trouble in Punjab all of that the riots in Delhi everything is something that you live through you know you feel it on your skin and through that what happens is that books become a way of understanding the far past recent history and also a comfort and a refuge I know I've traveled very far from where we expect it to be but you know maybe we keep circling back to this whole thing of reading and I just want to take a moment to say something that surprised me when I studied as in not studied but just read about the freedom struggle was how many of our leaders from Maulana Azad to Ramanohar Lohia to the ones we've just named set a great store by reading and building their own libraries and once I sat down for a column I was writing for the business standard which is the first place that opened its doors to me and gave me the space to be a columnist at the then you know ridiculously young age of 22-23 they really made me into a journalist but one of the columns I did for them was about the libraries of the leaders of the national movement and you start going through those books you know 3,000 of them 4,000 of them Gandhi's collection Nehru's collection and you start to see that they use books to really read their way into the whole question of what is freedom and what is our independent country going to be and it's so fascinating that they reached all the way across you know Gandhi read American early vegetarians for inspiration along with stories about the Europe reformation and all of that and then they circled back to their own country their own language and come up with an extremely particular very Indian approach to democracy none of that is accidental you know I don't think there was a point of time at which they valorized reading in their own minds or they said this is a good thing to do or was self-conscious about it it's just that I find it so touching that the two things that they did all through the years of the freedom struggle from the 1900s onwards they wrote letters furiously you know our sense of the past really has to change we think that we so cool with our Twitter updates and our blog posts and everything but if you start to look at those gigantic volumes of correspondence you realize that even on his silent days Gandhi spent so much time you know composing these swift emails these notes to himself he spent a life in writing Saroji Naidu moving between the poems and the speeches where her auditory which today seems to us to be a little flowery and a little overblown for that time though it was deep with emotion you know and she could hold audiences in the palm of her hand as such and you see that the before they were leaders who were they you know this is a question I keep going back to with everything before we were authors before we identified ourselves as whatever what was it that we were moving towards and you see those early whispers of self-respect of challenging the history that you've been given and saying that no you know the British did not make us a whole and a collective and a people the land and the history of the land does not fully make us Indians because we did not think of ourselves as Indians before that but here we are at this moment in time and we can literally imagine ourselves into being I think it's remarkable that the Constitution which is a written document after all you know everywhere after a while when I saw the freedom struggle slightly differently I started to see it as a thing that was held together not just by protests as important as they were and by actions but by breath and speech and writing and imagining you really have to imagine a country into being you know that's the other side of being a nation okay I've gotten my soapbox long enough I need to shut up and give you a chance to.

        "message": "this and it's not just the time to sit down and think and reflect because you can write letters at high speed as well but it's more like the kind of speed that's expected in Twitter exchanges you have to address something now and in that moment of a controversy exploding the urgency is sharp and immediate but by tomorrow everyone's forgotten so one of the biggest problems we have is that we live in a state of perpetual amnesia right and when you have that as an affliction for society you are no longer in touch with your own psyche your own self right with letters I'm going to answer this a little discursively but I still have letters that I wrote to my school friends years ago and sometimes those contain years and years of correspondence and then you can mark the moment when emails arrived because suddenly the letters stop our first emails this was when you had stuff like Hotmail and Lycos around yeah our first emails for the first few years are really long we're trying to go back to letters in a sense because that's what we are familiar with and I noticed this years later when I was printing out my Lycos mailbox before dispatching that account unconsciously we were all from India writing to inland letter form length you know if I don't know whether this generation would remember that but unconsciously your mind was trained to three landscapes you were trained to write the postcard you were trained to write inland letter forms and you were trained to write the free-flowing letter for which you would buy onion skin paper you know and you'd dwell on your envelopes and it was very important also to go to the post office and say sir sir if Gandhiji ki stamp mat dena doosra stamp dena Asia at Games ki stamp hai aapke paas you know you wanted the stamps to be as fancy as the letters were we used to covet the bird stamps and all of that so there were so many parts to the letter it wasn't just writing it it was wait for the ink to dry tear up this draft because you have said too much from your heart you know to a boyfriend or something of the sort and put it back in and then put it into the envelope put the stamp down then all the secret little hearts and flowers that the women used to write to each other you know so all of that Tehzeeb all of that ritual and everything goes away at some point we find ways to bring it back but I remember some years ago when my friend Margaret Mascarinehurst who was an incredible writer and poet in Goa when she died it was a sad thing to have only whatsapp messages to archive you know because we met in person the whatsapp messages became they served a different purpose then they became like little pointers whatsapp to each other about this on this day and then suddenly a memory of a conversation would open up but they really know more than memorial aids you know thumbnails they don't have the satisfaction that accompanies letter writing but right now if you ask this generation take some time out you might get people to do one letter who is going to sit down and do the full chain you know that business of you set aside some time every week to write letters you go on holiday and you write a letter that also indicates a certain faith in we've been talking about speed and the amnesia and the other part of it let us bespeak a kind of permanence and a faith in the record so somewhere unconsciously as our handwriting has gone I think we've also it's I wouldn't call it a cause but I would say it's gone hand in hand with this very modern lack of faith in the historical record you see what I mean when everything is impermanent and everything dissolves and everything can be killed once a particular social media platform shuts down you can use lose years and years of photographs and notes if Facebook goes tomorrow or you can lose 40,000 tweets written over 10 years if Twitter goes tomorrow and somehow increasingly these interactions I'm still on Twitter because that hook is there you know what is that hook it's partly the fear of missing out it's partly and this is the nice side of it the desire to keep in touch with people who are there but partly and this is the dangerous side of it we all think we immune and we are not it doesn't matter how smart you are but social media the way it is formulated in present days is built to be sticky we know that you know I can spend five minutes on Twitter fine if I spend half an hour on Twitter my days gone and after a while my moods my emotions those very intimate personal things have changed instead if you train yourself to back away and to use it then you lose what we had when we first found Twitter if you remember Twitter was all about finding a new way of expressing yourself and that's also what the first-generation web was about Hussein Deirakshan who's the Iranian blogger who went through an incredible and very saddening experience he was held in jail for many years and when he came out among the many dislocations he faced was a real sense that the world itself had changed because the net as he knew it the World Wide Web had changed beyond recognition and he was one of the first people to write about the fact that when you had blogs they created a universe of islands that were linked but you weren't you weren't content does that make sense that makes a lot of sense yeah and today I think when everything is being massaged into content and brands and all of that and I'm absolutely not averse to the pursuit of success through writing all the things all I want to say is that there are deeper satisfactions you know writing just isn't just about having a best-selling book out there or having the great career or whatever if you really want to write a lot of writers started off telling stories or being part of the weave of having stories told to them in my case it was my mother who became a lawyer at the age of 39 but before that you know she used to do these incredible bedtime stories where she'd look at whatever the pattern was on our curtains or whatever shadows there were on the wall and make up things about that and you don't even realize you don't use the formal words my imagination is being trained but what you learn is double at this point you learn that you are absolutely free to use your imagination in whichever way you want to and you also learn that even adults you know even parents even these people who have so much power over you have wonderful secret lives so right from the start what you start to learn is the importance of having this private self this individual self and if I may say so this whinely creative self I live in fear that creativity will become another one of those buzzwords you know but the truth is I think something we've been talking about for years and years among ourselves or whatever is with privilege without privilege how do you live lives that are more fully creative and I don't mean just formally creative I don't mean that you have to be a writer in the sense that you have to publish books so you have to be an artist in the sense of you have to have a painting exhibition I'm not talking about the outcome or the productivity but I'm saying a life of consumption which is what we increasingly have been driven towards consumption not just in terms of buying things that you then show off but in terms of your most intimate moments are held out for display or that your identity is as a clever consumer of life right if you shift that paradigm just a little bit and I mean by the way you really"

        "message": "come at questions because you're asking us by and large during the podcast to tap into something that is deeper than just the automatic list of the 10 books that influenced you or what made you want to be a writer or whatever and I think my deepest desires were for a combination of privacy and experience and immersion particularly into the world of stories one of the thick desires that I didn't act on for many years because I was terrified of actually making it happen was that was writing I came to writing very late I don't mean that I came to writing late actually I've been writing for a living from the time I was about 19 or 20 I think I wrote my first book review when I was 15 years old or something of the sort obnoxious in that sense we Bengalis what can I say but I was working at the business standard by the time I was 19 years old 1920 yeah and I was with them for about 15 years or so I didn't really know how to want a career a lot of people asked me for advice on their writing career and I am blank about that I knew that I was curious about many many things I think my one of my deepest desires was just to both experience the world in every form so I was a travel writer I was a food writer for a while I was on the gender beat with the New York Times and I see that as just an urge to in this human lifetime in this human form reach out for as much of the world as possible that was far more important to me than material wealth status and all of that which in just as well I chose writing as a profession in that sense I will say in parenthesis that while writing hasn't made me you know ridiculously wealthy it's surprising that it doesn't make you that poor either it's it's possible to make a living doing something that you love which is one of the first things that we believe is not true you know a thick desire again just solitary exploration as a young girl in Delhi I think I'm militated against the fact that at a certain hour of the evening the city becomes a men's city and you can't walk safely as a woman and I was very diffident but also insistent that I should walk everywhere that I should you only see a city or know a city really whether it's London or Delhi or Calcutta or Bombay it's only on foot that you really get the pulse of it the beat of it the sense of it outside of your own neighborhoods right and there you have it you know a question I think for me being in movement creating not for a prize and not for a book contract but just the work ultimately it keeps coming back in the writing to me and the page I like people to be able to read through whatever I'm writing very swiftly but I also like the work that goes into making that read a swift read I like them to walk away whether I'm writing about cats or humans with the feeling that they have been in a real world and a world that is maybe a little more intense and more real than the world that surrounds you again I have a habit of segwaying and traveling very far from the question that you asked but I was very fortunate when I was in my 20s in my first job again at the Business Standard and then later as a young editor at Penguin to meet a lot of writers and artists in Delhi at a time before success had in that sense touched and transformed both the art world and the literary world so MF Hussain at that point of time had his own right painting studio he was already becoming the big financial success that he was but for most other painters there wasn't that much money on the table per se that didn't lead to a life of great purity it just meant that there was a freedom in the way that they were writing there were a handful of galleries that were exhibiting their work and so it was for writers you know for Amitav Ghosh sitting in a Barsati in defense colony writing his first books and shaving off half his hair as incentive to keep him indoors writing and not outdoors distracted or for Shahid Agha Shahid Ali you know coming out with his poems in which he puts pain and love and a sense of foreboding because I think Shahid was one of those people who saw many many years ago the future to which Kashmir was inexorably moving I don't think he had any defenses against the truth but with all of these writers I spent a lot of my time in writer student studios you know in Gari village with meeting ceramic artists like Joy Michael and Gina Franklin Gupta and a huge suite of people and every now and then business standard would push me out and make me interview fashion designers which is how I came to accidentally dance in Milan Soman's direction while I was still wearing a khadi kurta from Khadi Gramodiyag Bhavan. Is this on tape? Have you danced? Thank God! No! What was this? It was a fashion show it was an early fashion show where Rohit Bal was just and Tarun Tehriani were just about breaking through and there was so much snobbery and deadly you know the initial reaction to this generation of fashion geniuses from Rohit Bal and Tarun Tehriani to Reena Dhaka and the rest was Hai unke beta toh darzi ban gaya you know that boy has gone and become a tailor and then of course liberalization happened India hit the stratosphere but this was just a little before that he took the first few fashion shows with the proper catwalk and a ramp and stuff and I was sent off to cover this and I bought a dress specifically for this I remember this because at that time Delhi didn't have much in the way of places where you could buy fancy clothes and I went off and bought a dress which in retrospect was a horror I remember very little about it except that I'm sure there were frills involved and puff sleeves or padded sleeves padded sleeves yeah the 80s power woman padded sleeve which had lasted into the early 90s let's draw a merciful vein over this memory but I wasn't able to get back home from the office in time so I went off to this fashion show in what I was wearing which happened to be a khadi kurta which is not what you wear to a fashion show then or now but you know bless them they were very warm and inviting and suddenly the music starts up and I'm on the catwalk I mean I was at the side of the catwalk but the catwalk was basically a red carpet on the ground and the music was contagious that was a less formal time and all of us started dancing and I turn around and there's this sweet guy with a lot of muscles who's quite good-looking and he dances a little bit in my direction I'm like okay you know he's a good dancer yeah he has the beat whatever and then I asked somebody who's he and they say Minin Soman yeah he's a supermodel already at that time one little brush with fame Delhi in that time was a lot of fun though but it was fun also because it was informal it was the kind of place where the writer Alan Sene used to play guitar at this little place called The Cellar which was one of the two or three places that you could go to for entertainment the first discos had started up Gungroo and my kind of place and I guess we led this kind of double life you know we were not most of us didn't have much pocket money you didn't have the chance to really work at jobs and stuff but if you could afford the entrance fee for Gungroo then you could dance the night away discos didn't shut down till about six in the morning if ever you know so you'd finish that and go to the clarages and everybody there'd be about eight people sitting there ordering one pot of coffee and bless their hearts they let us do that they were kind about that but getting back to the writers and the artists in their studio I think the three things I learned from them is the work itself is often messy and the opposite of joyful and you will be cursing as you do your first drafts or your early sketches or whatever but there is a joy to the work itself does that make sense everybody and some of the writers were drunks by their second profession you know a lot of the artists were happening into a range of other vices and pursuits and parties and this that and the other but the one thing that they all did was they showed up if you were serious about being a writer or an artist you owed it to yourself and to the work more than anything else not to the craft you know not to your vocation or reputation or yes sir but to the work itself to just show up day after day and the third thing was take some joy in what you're making you know don't try to write like somebody else Vikram Seth didn't get to write a suitable boy by trying to imitate a Steinbeck or somebody else if you see what I mean Arundhati Roy didn't find her voice by trying to be somebody other than she was I think that was the biggest thing that I started to pick up as well tell your own stories that generation was not focused on success very much the next generation has learned how to negotiate the world of celebrity television and what to do on a lit fest stage and all of that and I think when all of that is fun it's sometimes the part of lit fest that is great is really getting to meet readers for me and the other part of it it's wise to think of it as dress up you know you get to play dress up and go out but maybe not take it too seriously I think over the course of a lifetime I've also seen how a lot of writers can stop writing after having done some great work this one whom I don't want to name but you know whose books have got weaker and weaker as their public life has become more and more important and you sense at some point that the writer lives in the shadow of the books and that the public appearances this whole thing about speaking in public and being important and even the good stuff of supporting this cause or that cause the truth of it is that most of writing doesn't even happen on the page it happens in a pact of silence and unless you give the I think this is something we've been moving towards from the start of the conversation it's a question of where do you find rich ground and it is true that many of us come to these places from a lot of privilege but I will also say that wealth and comfort are not the pathways to writing I mean just a simple observation that many people have made before me if that was true then the rich would be writers right and the rich aren't really and the reason that they aren't is because actually writing actually creating something and then having the patience to go back and revise we all fall in love with the first things that tumble out of our mouths and all of that the fact is that most bits of writing are not much good unless there's some revision or some craft to it and I find that either the craft comes in before a lot of people do the outlining and the plotting and all of that even if they're just holding it in their magnificent heads or it comes in after but it's very rare for writing not to have craft even at the popular end of the scale and popular is not to be sneered at but someone like Stephen King someone like Daniel Steele someone like Chetan Bhagat they work really hard at the craft of getting people to continue to read and identify and feel something you see what I mean all these years anyway I should again hand it back to you because I'm about to deliver a lecture"

        "message": "I think so much happens particularly with a novel but this is true also of short stories and possibly every form of writing except for the poem poems can happen to you as you know a lot of poets report the experience of feeling the poem more or less take you by your collar and just run through you and all you have to do is to write it down and then continue to revise or whatever. In every other form of writing inspiration is important essential all of that but if you've been working in the field of writing whether you're doing screenplays or whatever you know actually that idea generation is the least of it. In between books I struggle for a while because I have no lack of ideas it's the opposite I have an idea a minute you know there's exercise books filled with ideas for short stories ranging from the risible to the hmm this might work but you only have so much time right and the imagination is the thing that we tend to skip over when we are talking about writing a lot of discussions particularly American influence discussions go immediately to craft to style to plot to voice all of that those are not unimportant but I think you know what you're doing with your course as well is training people to the idea of the practice itself and what is that practice it's just a way of turning on the headlights of the imagination and turning on the terrain and that old classic question where do ideas come from Neil Gaiman used to say there's a little shop down the road and you know a man across the counter hands me my ideas every morning in a nice paper bag or something to that extent the truth is we don't know we don't know Elizabeth Gilbert again the author of Eat Pray Love she's talked about the surreal but very real and very commonplace experience of having an idea for a book that you haven't worked on and you let it go and four years later somebody else comes up with that book in total and the first time it happens it's eerie it's not plagiarism but it feels like a theft from your unconscious until you realize that you're in spooky territory out here you are part of the collective unconscious of course there's a possibility that maybe the idea wasn't that precious after all some years back when I was just about starting out on the notes that became Black River and I knew I wanted to do a thriller I knew I wanted it set in Delhi I knew that it wasn't going to be about people like me and so it would require some research I knew that the river played a large part in it and I knew that it was about heartbreak and grief and I knew nothing else and this idea skated around my head why don't you write about Sheherazade instead you know bring her into our contemporary times and what would she be now with the weight of everything that she's experienced and gone through she becomes this man's bride after seeing so many women killed you know literally a bed of blood and then she ends up married to this murderer you know for the rest of her life she wins her life back but the price of that seems pretty high maybe she's a drug addict and I never wrote that story because the truth of it is that Sheherazade's I do believe that we should be free to write with no limits on the imagination but I bump up against the difficulty of translating Sheherazade into my times there's just too much about her background her Middle Eastern life that I would not know or be comfortable with I tabled it many years later I read a book by another writer and beautifully done book where there's Sheherazade in modern times and she's an addict of sorts and I don't think anyone's stealing from anyone else it's just that that realm is mysterious but it's accessible to all if you train yourself and if you train the muscles of the imagination which are as real if you like as the muscles of a runner yeah so that's part of what happens off the page is learning to quieten down because nothing happens in the noise even the writers who go out you know in the middle of the hurdy-burdy of life the bars of Paris the slums of Bombay the permit rooms and all of that at some point you're gonna have to come back to quietness that's where it all starts that's the fertile ground at least you're gonna have to quiet down enough to hear the voices of the people that you're writing about right and then comes the shaping you know that can happen off the page in a very technical sense as in you might be doing your notes and outlines and all the crafty things that you do but I think some of that really happens when you're living in the classic two worlds you're not you're walking around you're talking to your partner and your friends you're going shopping and all of that but part of you really at that point of time truly is living somewhere else you know that's one reason why I find short stories which I don't know how to write but which I'm trying to learn how to write a little easier because you can't quite pop in and out it's just as intense but you don't have to spend years in that world right when I say most of the writing happens off the page there's another thing as well which is simply that everything you were before you turn to writing is also what you're bringing to the table right a lot of people want to be writers really young and I find myself not wanting to be discouraging but just wanting to say would you like to go and live a little you know don't the MFA by itself is a fine thing but try not to build a life maybe that's MFA and writing residencies and those slightly enclosed worlds if that makes sense that makes"

the RSS that's that's a parallel problem that is a political issue let's get back to reading per se I think often the claims that we make for reading a very very large because we see the value of it okay but as a lifelong reader I've sometimes asked myself aside from the sheer delight of it what use is this per se everything that you say about reading I'm just being devil's advocate out here you can learn as much from YouTube videos okay or you can learn from podcasts you don't have to be a reader in order to learn skills okay what we found in books is to be honest about it deep and abiding delight and we've also found an infinitude you know of possibilities you know how many books I wrote a column about this for the FT which is how I know these figures I'm not just you know making them up but the maximum number of books that most readers are going to be able to read in a lifetime is 5,000 and that's if they are obsessive readers who read more than about 80 books a year and I remember when I came across that number I had a moment of pure panic that I never feel this about humans I never feel like how is how am I going to go through life not making all the friends I possibly could make you know but I do feel it about books that hunger and what I prize about books particularly is that they're one of the clearest not the only but they're one of the clearest windows we have to connecting with past minds everything else that you can learn from whether we just mentioned you know YouTube videos podcasts sound basically and film all of that is in by and large in the present you see so reading is the one thing that is so out of time music is one of the others dance is one of the others art yes but as an instrument for learning reading is out of time and reading challenges you perpetually because it keeps inviting you to inhabit other points of view not just listen to you know as important as that listening is it doesn't always come with identification when you're reading a book particularly a physical book I have nothing against reading audiobooks but there is a caveat to that if you're reading in a distracted space you're not going to be able to retain that much of the book and with an audiobook or with the Kindle your reading experience is often incredibly enjoyable but there's a spatial problem a geographical problem if you like I find that with reading on the Kindle or in audiobooks I never know where I am in the book does that make sense where is the physical book you was moving through it and you can tell whether you're at the beginning the middle or the end and that has an impact on the way you remember certain things from the book I do think that we overestimate the virtue of reading and maybe underestimate the fact that most of us are readers because it is sheer delight sometimes challenging sometimes unpleasant I just spent some time reading memoirs by a woman Shabitri Devi who was part of the right wing had a book blurb by Savarkar and believed firmly not just in the virtue of the Nazis but she believed that Hitler was alive that Jews and other people should be put to the sword you know and there was something cold-blooded about reading that and I think for a while after that I found myself you know as with Mein Kampf unable to read for a short while actually read for a short while because you're encountering thoughts of pure evil and inhumanity let's put it that way that's on label it as evil as such the thing that you asked about the inequality in reading in this country we've always had public libraries but not on a grand scale not like America what we've had is the one-room library you know that's how my father who grew up in the town of Cuttack in Orissa he and his brothers had a book hunger ignited in them in part by the fact that there were very few bookshops and that their access to books was so limited in a way as an adult I found that you know though my mother's family was surrounded by books growing up in Calcutta and all of that it was my father who bought books to the point where he sometimes you know drove my mother mad by taking the grocery money and coming back instead of with dal and rice and stuff like that he'd come back with figs and chocolates and time-life encyclopedias and a host of you know everything from Shoru Chandru to Tolkien to Toni Morrison to Garcia Marquez in fact a lot of my reading habits were influenced by him because he didn't believe in denying any of his children access to books you know he believed that if you picked up a book it was up to you to decide whether it was at your level or not and that was one of the biggest freedoms that reading gave me there was no censorship to reading you see in everything else particularly when you live in a country like India which has been working towards defining itself as a democracy but has never been as radically individualistic a society as America or parts of Europe and never defined itself by the freedoms of the individuals you know even if in its most politically free periods I don't think the freedom of the individual has been books are one space where you can be whatever you know you can reach for whatever you can be challenged outraged disgusted you can hate what you're reading you can love with your reading you can identify with it or not but it is a completely free space instead of that what we had was first the radio revolution then we had TV and then we had you know today's social media revolution which is to some extent also engineered for heat or for very very intense short compelling stories of a certain kind right what we didn't invest in as a country was the infrastructure that people take for granted elsewhere the infrastructure of libraries and bookshops and all of that you know and without that investment it's not just being able to afford books I grew up in Calcutta in part and it was very democratic city where reading was concerned it wasn't a question of whether people could afford books they made space in their budgets at practically every level except for the most abjectly poor if you were had any kind of income you would be buying books and magazines and you know they were cheap and you had an equality a kind of democracy as a reader you could be a guy on a bus sitting there reading you know Murasaki in translation and you could be sitting in your fancy Baliganj a red brick bungalow reading Murasaki and there'd be no difference between the two of you you know you both had an equally valid opinion does that make sense so I've often felt that we've not responded adequately to the book hunger of this country and that part of that is this emphasis not by you but in a lot of ways you know people train people to read useful things even if you're not reading textbooks but what you read should be informative in some way or educational or make you money right and if there's a reading revolution I'd like to usher in in this country it's not just the whole thing of more bookshops and more places to read more bookshops and let me say this I believe our booksellers do a wonderful job but I would also like to see bookshops and libraries that are beautiful and set up in all kinds of parts of the city not just in the affluent side of the city not just in malls you know they really should be much more accessible one place where we feel I'd like to see books in the hands of everybody because one of the things that I used to do was to work on library recommendations for companies that stocked libraries around Gurgaon and you know these were early versions of the community library that Mirdala Koshi and Michael and others run so well and these to sponsor specific schools and there was a point where you're stocking the library but you're also giving out a few of those NBT books you know the little very well-made ones or Pratham's books and you're making sure that every child has two or three books and one of the kids he was about five six years old you know just about in school he sits there and he just cuts off from all of us and he's just sitting there with his book and he's reading it and he's on each page and slowly but surely he gets to the book and then he reads it again and then very reluctantly he hands it back to the team member who'd given it to him and he said no no this is your book you know and he was like okay so he starts reading it again and then he tries to hand it back and then somebody realized said no this is your book to keep not just in school but you take it home and he was just very silent for a second you know he didn't say anything it was he asked several times do I get to keep this after a while I turned around and I see him standing there in the corridor and he's hugging the book to himself and he was crying because he said no one's ever given him a book before you know and that was how precious it was and I think from that time onwards I don't work in the NGO sector but if there's one thing that you get passionate about it's about donating books to libraries and I really respect the people who are working at community libraries because it's not just about handing the books out and then walking away you have to help people find the books that they're going to love you know and I think that whole thing you know the understanding that there's a dormant book love in the country that often doesn't come to light because there's no way to feed that book hunger the question I ask is really what are we depriving people of sometimes just casual pleasure you know just the pleasure of reading Surinder Pathak's spy stories or Ibn-e-Safi's Jasusi Duniya stories or something of the sort sometimes it's somebody who might find practical advice in a book or learn about something that later becomes a career there's so many different levels at which books work you know and I wish some of the money that's going into the current horse trading of politicians you know the cross exchanging hands in order to topple the state governments I wish some of that was just put towards putting a book into people's"

        "message": "hands it would make such a difference that's that's such a lovely story I'll respond to three of the or rather I'll respond to what you said with three points and the first one is like you know at one level of course it's true that you don't need to rely on books alone for knowledge you have YouTube videos you have podcasts you have all of that but there is something books do give you which none of the others do and and again this goes to you know books that are not instrumental that if you want to learn something then you read the book and you get that knowledge from there but I think fiction gives you this deeper world of the imagination which I feel that sometimes we can take for granted even in ourselves it's like the seen and the unseen right it's unseen there is this story of and I'll probably say it wrong but it's a story about daddy fish and baby fish are swimming in the water and uncle fish passes by and he asks daddy fish how's the water today and daddy fish says great and then uncle fish goes on and then baby fish turns to daddy fish and asks what's water you know and I think we kind of take it for granted at that level and and not just that we and I've realized this about myself and I realized that I have to stop doing this that I assume that if there is a certain bedrock of experiences that have shaped me or certain cultural influences that I now take for granted that are like water to me I assume that others share it as well but others are not everybody is swimming in different water you know one of the reasons I like to go into the childhoods of people of my vintage or earlier in the show so much is that 60 to 70 percent of our country is born after liberalization you know that shared experience is not there of there being a waiting list if you want to buy a phone of so few cars on the street as it were and all of those things you know and I think books give you an entry into all of these worlds and they are immersive the word you used earlier and that's not something that YouTube videos or even podcasts such as mine will you know necessarily give people the other point almost a counterpoint to this that I want to make is that I actually tell people that listening to audio books is great because I think a mistake people sometimes make is that they think it's an either or that printed books and audio books compete with each other but as I discussed earlier thus the same use cases I mentioned for podcasts they apply for audio books as well not everyone has a privilege to sit down and take one hour every day when they are reading people live busy lives people have other kinds of responsibilities and things to look after but there will always be times where they can do passive listening so again my advice to people who do my course or people who might be listening to this is that even if you don't have the time to sit down and read a physical book it's okay to listen because you're still getting that world of the imagination you're still listening to those sentences and listening to the language and through osmosis a lot of it kind of sort of filters down and the third thing I agree with you on and this is something that I sort of make it a point to drive home again to people who do my course is that when you're reading read indiscriminately read everything you know we've built this hierarchies of reading that Gabrielle Garcia Marquez is cool Chetan Bhagat is not cool and that just makes me so angry because the point is that you know like you said our time in this world is limited in terms of what we can read right you mentioned 5,000 books for most of us who are a certain age is even less than that you know and you want to spend that time reading things that you enjoy reading so for me you know my metric for whether I read something is one if I'm enjoying it if I'm like there's a thrilling story happening you know Jasusi Duniya or whatever then that's a great reason to keep reading or if you want a certain kind of knowledge in a book but it's hard work but you want the knowledge it'll bring value to your life that's a good reason to keep reading but a bad reason to keep reading is because people say oh this book is in the canon or is one so and so prize and you have that fear of missing out and then you kind of go through that and then the sunk cost fallacy kicks in I've already read a hundred pages and all of that so there again I couldn't agree with you more my advice to everyone would be that do not spend time reading books you don't enjoy reading just read anything that you're you know having fun reading or that you feel adds value to you you know there is no such thing as a guilty pleasure when it comes to books and we'll go into a break now after which we'll come back and go take you back to your childhood from when you were three years old but before that you mentioned how your you know dad used to come back with all kinds of odd things when he was sent shopping so before the break I want to read out this lovely paragraph from your book where you write quote my mother and this is after your father's come back from shopping your mother's given him a list he's come back with things and you write quote my mother inspected the dining table and found chocolate cake figs and Gabriel Garcia Marquez in paperback but where are the dals and the masalas my father would treat the query with surprise surely my mother could see that there were more important things in the world but what are we to have for dinner my mother with Harilal nodding in ascent like a Greek chorus of doom would ask my father would point out with impeccable logic that he had technically come back with food the figs were of good quality and in those days frightfully expensive this was usually the point where my mother flew into a rage and stormed off to see what what could be cobbled together from odds and ends but she was in a minority the rest of us were on my father's side especially after I began reading Garcia Marquez the dal could always be watered it did no harm to anyone to eat khichdi for a few days but Macondo and for me Nadia Diaz and the banana companies and shipwrecked sailors could not wait a stop"

        "message": "uses of legacy publishing legacy publishing works really well for a variety of forms per se and it works well because by and large those publishing houses are staffed by people who love reading and that's been across the board you know most of the publishers have met within that universe there's a wide amount of variety by and large what we've seen in the UK for example is that independent publishers are bolder they're more willing to take risks they're less dependent on one of the curses of the industry which is that because of the way everything is packaged you know sometimes two years in advance and you're aiming your content at a series of bloggers or book loving sections you know book media that's going to be writing the summer book special of the year whatever you're very dependent on what's called the strap line which is a condensed form of the blob and it takes some time to understand that some publishers are absolute genius because their ability to predict and know their readers not just the market but their readership and say that this book that I'm publishing now taking it on massaging it into shape for about two years or so revisions edits all of that that near incredible instinct that a good editor has for how to take a book to where it should be even though you only have access to what the authors given you you know that's an incredible skill doesn't get talked about as much as translation and the skills involved out there but legacy publishing keeps pushing things into categories that benefit the marketing side of books marketing is not a dirty word either none of us writers would be alive without marketers but that means that things flow into very rigid categories you know so you belong to fantasy or science fiction or self-help or whatever and I've been questioning the use of genre forever because I really don't think that's the way we read or live honestly you know to me Tolkien years ago or Ursula K. Le Guin she works as a genre writer and she works as somebody who's got a stunning corpus of ideas recently one of my colleagues at the FT Robert Shrimsley picked up on Terry Pratchett and said that everybody who's an economist should read Pratchett for the way that he talks about ideas like democracy and cities exploding in certain directions and all of that you know there's not you could learn from him so it's our thinking that boxes the world into this creators by instinct have you noticed how many people are gravitating to the newsletter as a kind of modern form of the blog why is that because there's something in us that craves you know the particular the personal out of the cluster of newsletters are coming in a certain percentage of creators will fall off when they realize that it's really hard to sustain that some newsletters I have to say much despite my own love for the form I look at it and I think I wish they were working in tandem with an editor because this is repetitive or not too long but you know too familiar the materials may be being a little overworked and a good editor can make you see stuff that's there but where I itch sometimes to write my own newsletter and you know that's just one of the many forms that can attract you is in the absence of constraint so often when you have to massage a condom into 750 words there are gaps that a sensitive reader picks up they know that something has been left unsaid okay or sometimes you're doing the opposite I mean I hope I never do that as a columnist but it used to happen you know back in the day to a lot of other columnists at different papers you could sense that they were stretching you know that deadline had come up and they were taking a 350 word insight and pushing that until it filled the full 800 words when you don't have that constraint that freedom is something that's a extreme challenge and requires a huge amount of technical skill actually to manage well but think about it this way you have a world two kinds of worlds that have been pushing at us for a while saying listen legacy publishing is not everything that there could be one is the extremely sophisticated and layered world of fan fiction most people in the public arena know fan fiction only as E.L. James you know her book Fifty Shades of Grey came out of that but fan fiction is where it's a it's an enormous playground and a serious serious place for people who want to be writers and are not that concerned with marketing they're more into readership rather than sales let's put it that way and it's very satisfying for them it's also something that frequently pushes back at whatever mainstream writers even celebrated people even big names have made you know I mean a long time ago Hogwarts fan fiction or Harry Potter fan fiction was sitting there and punching very lightly in its own way at the areas where the books creator couldn't see you see what I mean so they were saying instead of saying in a column the portrayal of goblins verges on the racist they were creating their own fanfics where the goblins were the heroes of the story you know and that is such a beautiful way to make a criticism by creating something new and original yourself and the other part of it has been I'm a little skeptical of the huge marketing passion for this but book talk you know where young teens and young adults have started to discover their own books and push trends it seems to me that after a while book talk is also like a lot of Instagram influencing becoming conformist and moving away from it slightly anarchic things so to answer your question a little more succinctly let's say we have an opportunity and the way that the internet goes the way that the mainstream and the side stream if you want to call it that goes is first we expand out into this territory of almost limitless possibility which is what the first wave of the internet was and then at some point we get corral back into safety and into a little corporate zones and into the marketability of this that and the other but one of the things in the few workshops that I've done one of the things that I try to tell people who want to be writers for a lifetime is how would you write if you were not going to make any money from this whatsoever or any fame you know then what is it that you would do your thick desire your most deepest intense you know the writing that's going to wake you up and bring you to life and that could be anything I'm genre indifferent you know I'm not quality indifferent within your genre try at least to learn what the basic rules are not because rules are rules but because you're striving for a certain kind of clarity if you want to share a story then don't leave it messy and bristling when you can do better do the best that you can within that right but I've also learned a lot from the Hindi writing tradition for example of just letting a story come to you and setting it down in that moment a lot of the women writers particularly Hindi and Bengali the worlds that I know best outside of English taught themselves to write in very small segments of time you know so there's no question of we set up and then we think about this and we do this and that and the other it's like no we get right to it in between cooking this in between managing the household in between doing our other work we learn to set down four paragraphs and make that sink you know so I think what we are getting to is a very very old truth the importance of form something I was thinking about market forces you don't see that many playwrights in India in her generation I can think of basically Ani Zaidi and maybe one or two others and that's about it I do see can I come in with a small note of complaint yeah and I'm exempting really good writers of recent novels they know who they are I hope you know and some of them have done incredible work from Shivani Sibal to Dinsey Pereira to you know a host of others but if you're writing to the market then you're not just in danger of losing an audience or losing a chance you're in danger of something much sadder which is that you might never find out the kind of writer that you really should be right in recent years it seems to me that the the people who made their name in Indian English fiction were all told at that time there is no money in writing there's no use being a writer later they became famous you know everyone from Salman Rushdie to Vikram Seth to Amitav Ghosh the entire universe Kiran Desai etc but at that time they were told there is no reward in it and they went ahead and wrote what they wanted to anyway and I think there's a huge lesson out there I see a lot of literary fiction coming out first phase people are either trying to be Chetan Bhagat and in all these years there's only been one person at the top of the mythological fiction category of the popular fiction category there are very few imitators who really make it you know maybe because they're trying to imitate too hard Ankur Warriko on the other hand you know who's coming in with very Indian self-help but something that's new and refreshing then that's saying basically we're going to turn our back on politics but if you want good habits and a successful life and you want to have fun along the way here it is he's got a message a lot of the young Indian historians you know from Anjan Manotra to Manu to that entire range of Iramukoti etc they are on to something because they are following something that they are individually passionate about right when you write to the market you lose that edge so coming back to your question the field of possibility ahead of us I think we're all sensing that there's something out here beyond the mainstream and by the mainstream I'm not saying just legacy publishers now I'm seeing also the kind of media I've written for all my life I have a great respect for them and their traditions the New York Times Business Standard Financial Times all the places that I've written for you know the BBC etc they have a history and a tradition of respect for the process of fact-checking of shaping a story a particular way and it's wonderful to be part of that repository but I think as an independent creator if you have the guts and you have the honesty as well right it's one thing to say I want to write like Arundhati Roy what if you really want to write the Indian equivalent of Regency romances are you never going to find out you know what if you want to create something that doesn't exist at this moment you know some kind of a comic book or historical steampunk mashup and you're not doing it just because you were trying so hard to be somebody else or to do what the market rewards you know ultimately it just keeps coming back to this I know that there is also a practical side to everyone's writing life or writing career but don't follow the practical side of things to the point where you miss out on the true joy of being either a writer or a reader something that you were saying just a moment back about audio books and I was thinking about how I grew bored at some point of time about this debate between the Kindle and reading books I take the Kindle on my Kindle everywhere when I'm traveling because it's the easiest way to take along half a library and I notice I read differently on the Kindle you know what I was saying about being out of space and time is compensated for by the fact that I love reading poetry on the Kindle there's something about that screen and an individual poem that really makes it sing I hate reading long involved novels in e-book form but that's just me I prefer to read them I either as printouts or as books but I love the Kindle for short stories and instinctively I seem to read a lot more in the way of popular nonfiction on the Kindle so you know that's just another example of the way a platform has changed me with audio books there's no escaping it I do notice that I retain less in terms of you know remembering the exact order in which arguments have been made in a book if I listen to the audio book version but there is a compensating factor sometimes the characterization particularly if the narrator of the audio book is good I get the characterization better I give up a little bit of my independence as the reader to imagine the voices and the landscape the way I want to in that sense an audio book narrator is also you know like a translator a co-creator right and sometimes you can just settle back into that creation and have it sing to you you see what I mean I think a lot of people in India do use audio books more practically so you know when you start to move into all of this you start to see that where you expected things to be linear they aren't all of these forms of storytelling and receiving stories there's no one above the other there is really a democracy out there in terms of you know if you prefer paper books that's fantastic but you know for every I don't want to I do love the smell of paper myself but sometimes every so often because I live in Delhi right and it's hot and humid simultaneously in summer and the smell of second-hand paper books can bring to mind a not very clean bathroom I'm not as romantic about the smell of papers other people are I just think it changes depending on place and time and stuff like that that was a long long direct digression but getting serious for a second I think the more we try to write what already has been written of course when you start off as a writer sometimes you're imitating the first three things I tried to write came out sounding like the writers I love the most you know I was trying to write serious social commentary like Mahasweta Debi the great Bengali writer who spent a lot of her life you know really listening to her friends who were part of tribal India and coming up with a completely different consciousness but she had a fierce political way of writing that is probably not me and I would be wise to find my own voice the first novel I wrote which is thankfully dead buried and disappeared in one of our many house moves was like a terrible terrible mashup between Garcia Marquez and you know Nair Masood it was so derivative and all of that and I don't mind actually confessing that because I think we learn how to write again by imitating and we imitate who we want to be until we figure out who we are ourselves yeah what writing gives you is the freedom not just to imagine different things but really to step into very very distinct worlds and to be different people in your lifetime you're not gonna get that many chances unless you're an actor or something of the sort you don't get that many chances to be completely different from who you are and that's part of the writing that is most thrilling to me in terms of possibilities so again coming back to the whole thing of form it's not just that you're removing restraints you also unconsciously challenging people instead of you know Twitter that scroll down thing or Facebook that wall what can you do with the space of a screen and I've seen so many writers particularly the poets always seem to be the most inventive of the lot but you know use that suddenly realize that on a screen you've got a left field space maybe that's on a page less populated but on a screen you can dance out there you can do things out there you can bring in images you can build something around that you can collage you know there's there's really no limit you can dance with Milan Soman on a"

        "message": "screen out there a bunch of responses but one I really you know like that question what would you write if no one was to read you it sort of reminds me of the quote that character is what you do when no one's looking and you know one of the pieces of advice I give creators both those who do my writing course in my podcasting course like I remember the first time I taught the taught my podcasting course which I teach about twice a year someone asked about you know where are the gaps in the market or what should I aim for or do you have any suggestions and I was like that is completely the wrong way to think that you know one if there are any quote-unquote gaps in the quote-unquote market many others are going to discover it and go for it but that's the wrong way to think you know if there are like seven billion people on this planet and there are more than a million podcasts out there the only thing that makes you unique is you because only you are you so the the most important quality for creators who succeed is that they are authentic to themselves and that totally speaks to your point about don't think about the market quote-unquote or what people may want to read or what people may want to listen to or whatever you've just got to figure out what you want to do and kind of go for that eventually it'll work out and I'll circle back to this but first I'll make a point about I'll share a thought about blogs and newsletters first of all for all my listeners who may not have been active during the first the first internet the early internet as it were there was this around the time I started blogging at India Uncut there was also an excellent blog written by someone called Kitab Khana written by someone called Hari Babu and there was much mystery over who is this Hari Babu who is this sort of mysterious person who is writing so well about literature and became almost a cult figure and it turned out later that Hari Babu was Nilanjana Roy herself and and I mean there was another pseudonymous blog Puttu the Cat which was Samit Basu so these are the two famous sort of pseudonymous blogs which people really loved reading and speculating on and it turned out that he were Hari Babu and what I loved about blogs in that time like you mentioned he started freed you from that tyranny of form you didn't have to do 800 words you could do 30 words you know and those were the days before micro blogging you could just put a link to something with a one sentence comment and that was it or you could do a thousand words if you wanted there's simply no limitation you were freed also from the tyranny of the news cycle for example otherwise if you're proposing an op-ed or an opinion piece it has to be something topical and you also kind of put in volume in the sense that you wrote a lot like I wrote you know five posts a day on average I did some 8000 posts in the five years reddit was active and one I wasn't self-conscious because my job was in mainstream journalism and for me this was like a release it's just a blog who's going to read it so you know that's how you start and then you lose that self-consciousness and you're just doing what you're doing and it worked for that reason however when people ask me today where they should write should they do a blog I always say no I say they should do a newsletter and the reason is that I think destination websites are pretty much done very few people are typing out URLs or like indiancut.com or haribabu.com or whatever it was and actually going to a destination website people are clicking on links on social media and so on and so forth and what a newsletter does is that you read an interesting piece by say Nilanjana Roy you immediately subscribe and instantly you are forever getting you know everything that Nilanjana Roy writes right into your inbox there is no effort it comes into your inbox you click it it's there and what that means for a creator like you is that you are building a community of people who like your writing which earlier you could not do this is one of the great things about the creator economy like in you write something in 1995 in Business Standard or Times of India or Indian Express or wherever someone reads that piece thinks huh this is nice and then they forget about it a week later and it's gone but here you're collecting a community of your fans and what newsletters allow you to do is a couple of things one is the other great quality you know if authenticity to yourself is a fundamental quality for a creator to have a fundamental quality of the relationship between a creator and the audience is a certain intimacy right which is really underrated because for example one of the finest compliments I've got for the podcast was someone heard my episode with Abhinandan Sekri and said that I felt so much like I'm sitting on a sofa listening to two friends talking that at one point I interrupted before realizing that what the fuck I'm listening to a podcast right and that intimacy is incredible and what that intimacy does and that intimacy happens because you're authentic to yourself you're not projecting you're not bullshitting you're just who you are and there is that intimacy your what you've written has gone directly to someone's inbox or is in their ears because they're kind of listening to it and what it does is and I'm thinking aloud here so I don't know if I'm coining this or someone has simultaneously done it but I think I'd make a difference between thick engagement and thin engagement and what that intimacy leads to is a kind of thick engagement where you feel intertwined with the concerns or the art of the person that you're listening to or reading or whatever and there then the absolute numbers don't matter so much like I would I would give far more value to a hundred thousand listeners for an episode of my podcast than say 20 million views on a YouTube video because in the YouTube video your average time of you know listening might be 15-20 seconds your engagement is much lower but here the engagement for the lower number of in terms of absolute numbers your engagement there is much deeper these people really really care and newsletters allow you to build an audience of people who really care about your work and the final important point here is and I'll lead to a question on this with you because it's something that I can't I've been thinking about and don't have an answer to but the final important point is that a newsletter allows you as a blog did to put in volume in the sense it allows you to put in a lot of work like the five posts I did during India uncut during when my blog was active for example and to me this is important because how does a creator become good a creator becomes good by doing something again and again and again and again and again by constant iteration and a danger for creators is if you care too much about validation initially your numbers won't be good initially when you do something you will suck at it like I sucked at blogging or I sucked at podcasting when I began you do it again and again you become better now initially you will never have numbers so if you care about validation you will simply not you know you'll stop at some point and therefore you won't iterate enough to actually become good at it which is why it's that question to circle back to it what would you write if no one was reading is incredibly important that's what you should write because initially no one will be reading and then because you write that again and again and again you get good at it and you build that audience organically and so the value of putting in volume which is a term poker players use get a large sample size play a lot of fans so I don't know if others use this terminology but the value of putting in volume is that in a sense quantity does lead to quality one you do something again and again you become better to you grow your audience organically by doing something again and again and constant exposure and my question is that where this kind of breaks down of the context in which I can't figure out how this works is the context of novels and literature because a novelist for example will write one book for eight years they're not putting in volume they spend eight years they write one book they take a break the book goes out in the world and most of the time for most novelists it just disappears it's like nothing happened right and then you got to get back to the grind and you're not putting in volume in the same sense that you know that a blogger is or a newsletter writer is and all of that and this befuddles me a bit because I think if you are a storyteller if you are a person of the imagination if you love writing on the one hand you might want to write novels because that's the kind of sprawling work you want to do but on the other hand it runs into this sort of problem and one question of course is that are there other things you could simultaneously do with your creative faculties whether you're doing a newsletter thing I think Substack is doing something with Salman Rushdie but I haven't looked at it too closely but it feels a little gimmicky but should artists explore other forms like that and kind of work at it because there's a danger also I think for someone who's a novelist to think inside a box and think I am a novelist so you think inside the novel box and you don't go outside it and my final tangential point I was talking to someone who works in marketing in the publishing industry just a couple of days ago and the point that I made is sort of an idealistic point in one way which is that a good product is the best marketing and that's obviously necessary for something to work but also what I was trying to point to is that when say a book is released I think there can be the tendency to make a marketing plan and say that okay we'll do this on Instagram, we'll do this on Twitter, blah blah blah and you make those different, we'll do this on YouTube and then you're just ticking boxes and it's kind of automatic and it has zero impact with the world because it is shallow and because therefore you have thin engagement to use that term again whereas if authors and artists sort of thought of everything they do not as marketing but as a kind of content on its own then I think that there is you know that will create thinking engagement at whatever level it does so for example if you've written a novel and one of your characters is simultaneously writing a newsletter even if it's a minor character then I think that engagement goes off the charts and even for the creator you know your juices are churning in different ways so I mean again I have sort of digressed a bit and you know but this is sort of a subject I think about a fair bit so what are your sort of thoughts on this?"

        "message": "I am literally not literally but the imagination is a powerful thing you know at different times they think the fable is it the fable is where the smart money is you know at another stage all the cool kids want to be Chaucer or they want to be Kadidas or something of the sort right common to all of that is the thread of something so deep and so shallow simultaneously why do you want to create you know what is the satisfaction of putting this world out there. I've seen novelists at different levels someone like Stephen King is 74 years old almost 75 and has probably written almost as many books as his age you know he's gone well past 70 and so he puts the myth of you know a novel must take so much time and you must live in the side the hulk of this structure to rest. I took a lot of time to write The Wildings but that's because I'm very lazy and I got distracted by an infinity of things and I spent so much time on the world building I didn't need to spend that kind of time but the truth is I loved it you know there's a lot of stuff that didn't find its way into the book like I found this old chart where I'd done a cat's lifespan and a squirrel's lifespan and a bird's lifespan and tried to figure out what their days would feel like to them. There was the time that I decided that one had to see the world from the perspective of different people and I spent an infinite amount of time not an infinite a finite but considerable amount of time trying to figure out the difference between how bats process night and birds process night. At the end of it the bats have one paragraph in the book or something like that. There's a great essay by Thomas Nagel, what is it like to be a bat? I read that one as well as part of my research okay but the reason I was doing that much research was partly just for the fun of it partly because I really didn't know anything about world building at that time and I was giving myself my MFA privately in the whole world building thing and the third reason was procrastination as long as I was researching I didn't have to get down to the book. The thing is that novels if you do them right they live for a very very long time. Some of the novels that we have have lasted for well over 300 years or so. The epics that we have, the myths that we have, the fables that we have are not literally but in effect they are timeless, they have been there in our minds and carried from one generation to the other. Something you realize, why would you do this? Why would you be a novelist? When you're actually writing you realize the thing that sounds so twee when you say it but it is absolutely I assure you 100% true. Stories and ideas and storytelling has a peculiar life to it of its own. When you try to start writing a novel you're usually getting it wrong, everything feels dead on the page. There's a moment where you enter the life of the book and you will not know even when the book comes out and the reviews come out and readers say nice things or whatever it is you will actually not know whether your book is alive or not for many years afterwards. But that aliveness is indescribable, it's electric, it's the kind of feeling that you have if not the power of being a god but let's say the awe of being a god and bringing a world into full view and that you would spend years on anytime, any day. It is so rewarding, it is one of the most beautiful things in the world because there's no way you can shorten that timeline. You might take just three months to write a novel, you might take four years, you might take eight years but the individual book, the individual tale, the aliveness that it accrues over a period of time, whatever that process is it can't be shortened. Sometimes it's so intense that it feels as though you're possessed, it feels as though the story is writing itself through you. Sometimes you have to struggle to, one of my characters in Black River spent years just saying, sorry you don't know enough about me, you know you're still viewing me as an interview subject and this was all wordless communication. It's only when you can see from behind my eyes, that's not my phrase, I think that's Michael Dundati's but it's only when you can get to that point and the reason you're trying to get it right and you're trying to sand down edges and bring it more and more to life is not for the perfect sentences or the beauty of an image, all you're trying to do is to do some justice to this world that is of your creation but that is also coming from somewhere beyond your left shoulder, you know. And to be part of that whether it's a novel you're writing or whether it's one of Paula Reggio's incredible paintings she just passed away some weeks ago or whether it's a dance performance where your act of creation is in that moment on the stage and then you have to go back and repeat it the next day or something of the sort. You see what I'm saying, there's something about the process of creation itself so long as you don't get pompous and sonorous about it but I can tell you something that process is when you feel most alive, you know, and there are other ways in which to feel alive on earth, you know, for some people it's sex, food, money, power, for some people it's adrenaline and thrills but I can tell you something, this thrill goes beyond everything else. You can channel it into 50 different directions, getting down from those, you know, high, high mountaintops into the practical side of life, there's absolutely no reason why an author can't do or be both and we keep talking about engagement, audience, all of that but the word that you used, intimacy, connection, right. In this rushing world that has changed so much from the time that, you know, I'm a little older than you but our childhoods overlapped and I think we look at this world saying that it's a world of infinite resource but very little satisfaction. So what you're trying to do as a writer whether it's with a newsletter or a novel is also to reconnect and to get people hopefully to re-see. The other reason, we didn't realize this, I don't think I ever thought about the, you know, internal emotional journey of blogging or something of the sort when I was Hari Babu, I picked his name out of Kipling and decided to, you know, rescue the Babu from the clutches of the Raj and turn him to good account but hiding behind a pseudonym also freed me up. It freed up a voice I didn't know I had and maybe it was an embryo, you know, early starting towards becoming a novelist even though I couldn't at that time admit to myself that I wanted to be a writer. There was something important I wanted to say about that, yes, about the blogs I think what we didn't realize we were doing at that stage was that we, through our attention, we were getting to understand our territory, right. As a writer, as a sports person, whatever it is that you decide that you're going to do, the thing that people have in common who really achieve something great with their lives and I'm not saying in terms of success, that's great, but I'm saying in terms of creating something of lasting worth or of lasting joy, forget about the word, you know, is their ability to filter out distraction and what a blog does did then and what a newsletter does now is just allow you within that space of easy armchair sitting back intimacy to say this is what I really find fascinating. Why can you not do it in any other way because even as we're talking we're generating I think a million ideas, everything that you're saying, I'm like, okay, you know, why didn't I think of this, the new creator economy moves in this fashion, but the new creator ecology is to me almost as fascinating, if not more fascinating than the economy, but I'm looking at these things and I'm thinking we're going back to very, very old fashioned emotions, emotional needs, psychic needs, if you like, what is this craving for Amit, you know, this craving is for depth, intimacy, curiosity, attention, the training of that attention, discovery, satisfaction, sharing, isn't that what we're talking about, isn't that the journey of a creator in whatever form?"

        "message": "that you sort of use it? Again, it's something that I'm visualizing as I speak, when I think of the creator economy, I think of the nuts and bolts of it, you know, how do you not just a simple thing of how do you monetize a newsletter, but in other ways as well, you know, how do you fuel this? It's very easy for anyone who's lived any kind of life to write maybe four newsletters, but part of your economy would be how do you keep generating the interest and the ideas? What is it that your ground is? What is it that you want to share with people? And the economy is also the economy of attention, the economy of money, etc. And that there's an entire infrastructure that goes along with it. When I think of the creator ecology, I'm back where we started with the blogs and stuff, which is what was the environment like? It was very tilted. First world blogging was much more populated and much more present than our world blogging. And yet we could make our presence felt, it was still a fair landscape. It was not, you know, our voices were not drowned out. There was also a lot of language blogging, you know, which woke up a need in me to read beyond English. I don't write in Hindi and Bangla. My Hindi is still unfortunately, my spoken Hindi is very, very Bengali inflected. But I would not give up the pleasure that I've had from reading in Hindi, Bengali and English simultaneously all these years, you know, it's just a joy and language blogging was a lot like that. When I look at the creative ecology, I look at people unconsciously moving outside of the grasp, the stickiness of Insta, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, you know, those are great training grounds. But at some point, I keep waiting for the MySpace kind of thing, where the owners of those spaces, which is some giant corporation, will fold them up or change them to the point where they no longer, you know, as it is Twitter for anyone who has a right wing active has changed, you know, in the early days, it used to be a safe space for us. So for Americans, or for Hong Kong liberals, and now it's not. And as a result, you're already censoring yourself for already being careful about what you see, is this going to get me into trouble? It's not a free space anymore, if that makes sense. With Facebook, the problem is slightly different. It's gone from being the pleasure of sharing your status updates and generating discussion on your page to being a very cluttered space. And frankly, a very elderly space as well, you know, you don't have young people out there. TikTok is great fun, but it's also very quick, quick, quick, you know, with Instagram. I love Instagram, it's very peaceful. It takes me to many places, art and design Instagram is fascinating. But if you notice, you never go backwards with these spaces. You never stop and you never reverse gear. You're always in an endless present or scrolling future. And one thing you're trying to do with this new creator ecology is to create something that is an evolution from the blogs. The way I see it is a kind of linkage, you know, I see again, the web part of the World Wide Web, if that makes sense, and intermeshing rather than a separate silos. The promise yet again, of a hierarchy-less world, which will eventually become hierarchical and then evolve out and be replaced with something else. But when I think of the ecology, I actually think of intertwining wires, creepers, whatever you want to call it, I think of something living and breathing. Already among writer newsletters, which is the narrow area that I follow, because people are reading each other's newsletters on creativity and craft and all of that. What's happening seems much less like independent nodes and more like a conversation and interchange"

Because I don't think the creator economy is just about the big platforms like Instagram or whatever. It's also about this conversation you and I are having or even other things that may not necessarily have an audience, but we are creators, we do what we do. And so it's all of that, I mean, to me an economy is really a web of voluntary interactions and it just goes into all kinds of directions. And again, and those wondering that what are they talking about roots of trees in forests, what is this? I'd recommend this lovely book by Peter Walgreen called The Hidden Life of Trees, which is such a lovely book, isn't it?"

        "message": "I'm just just started on that. But I was looking at all of this and I was thinking, you know, there's a lot of debates coming up against with nature writing, with people saying, OK, wonder is all very well, but more than wonder, you know, maybe we're finally taking our place in the world. You see what I mean? We're finally seeing ourselves not just as a human species, but as a human species embedded in something very real. And again, the world that we are talking about, books, internet spaces, these are landscapes of their own, if that makes sense. I sense that we haven't yet fully explored the tension between the new world and the old world way of doing things. I've been so one way or the other connected with the old landscape, right? Which is legacy publishers, legacy media. What's changed with them after a while is that you no longer have the expectation of working with the same editor over a long period of time or that you no longer can rely on job security. You know, what happened even with legacy media was a lot of organizations expanding, opening up their tents and then crashing dramatically five years down the line. I think there are very, very few places that continue to stay standing as institutions. We are losing that entire sense. With the new world, I'm a cynic after so many years of being online. And I look at the possibilities, but I also wonder how long it will take for us to mess it up, you know. On the other hand, you can't be that cynical. There's a point of time at which you have to look at what this enables. And I have, you know, both you and Roshan Abbas and a lot of other people are saying that the next five, six, ten years is likely to be a really, really interesting time for anybody who's willing to take individual responsibility, okay, for their lives and stuff. And something about the way newsletters work may remind me again of something from the Hindi writing world, Gitanjali Shree and a lot of writers, they will just automatically have their addresses, their own home addresses printed on the back or front flap of the book. Because the assumption is that if you write a book, you want readers to get in touch with you, you know. And I was just asking myself, when did we lose that in the English language world? You know, or did we never have that, was our concept of writing always somebody quietly there in their individual silo or castle, unapproachable, accepted festivals or something of the sort? You know, it's a difference. It's not just a small thing, if you know what I mean. This is the more time I spend in writing and reading, the more I realize and I'm not saying this as a humble brag, it's not about reading so much, but you realize with the shock that with every choice you're making with your reading, there's so much else that you're not going to know, you know. So if I'm reading a lot of literary fiction set in the present, then I'm not going to be reading that many classics from the past. If I'm reading thrillers and if I'm reading a lot of books on the environment, then the amount of time I have to spend reading food books has gone down, you know. And I still, I've lived half a century and sometimes I still feel like I'm still 20, reaching out for the world and saying, just give me more, there is so much to explore. I don't know, those different parts of your life, there's the part that wants to create, there's the part that wants to sit back and listen to other people or to read their work or to experience their creations. And there's the part that's just like, my God, you know, there's so much to explore, despite, I mean, I know we get depressed at the headlines and all of that. But I think something that's been continuous through all these decades, and I'm just looking back at it and thinking, you know, childhood was books coming out of the family cupboards and stuff like that, and adolescence was a lot of traveling and the 20s, there was the whole wide world of the internet coming at you, you know, this new frontier to explore. And my God, I just hope none of us ever loses our sense of wonder. You know what I mean? Behind all of these questions and all of that, you know, whatever you want to do with reading or writing, I think, I mean, of course, you write sometimes to witness terrible things and all of that. But I think all of this is just a journey into keeping your curiosity alive, and trying to find ways never to let that go in the pursuit of this goal or that goal or must have, you know, bungalow car, etc. Those are all very valid goals, nice things to do. But I cannot imagine living a life without curiosity, without wonder, without exploration."

And this is what I have to keep reminding myself, because I don't think I think it's a daily choice, in the sense that I don't think that you can tell yourself that I'm going to live a life of more curiosity and wonder or whatever, and then boom, the direction changes and that's fine. No, I think every day, you have to remind yourself to be mindful, remind yourself not to take stuff for granted, to notice the things that you've sort of normalized. In my case, I do notice the many ways in which you're so incredibly lucky for doing what you do or living the kind of life you live, and I think it's important to have that sense of like, Jesus Christ, I'm so lucky, right, despite which I'm known as an excessively pessimistic person, because of course, the country is going to hell and we're all going to die soon, but soon in geological terms. But I'll say one thing, I don't even know if it's a counterpoint. But perhaps I'm addressing a worry that you have is that you mentioned about how something new will emerge, and we'll find a way to mess it up. And I think this time, we won't mess it up. Because I think the direction that worry is going in is that there is a culture and that culture becomes stayed and mainstream and whatever, and then a counterculture emerges and the counterculture is really cool. But then it gets co-opted and it gets messed up. And then you have another counterculture and it's a cycle. But I don't think that's what's happening here. I think what's happening here is this fundamental, permanent shift towards decentralization in every way, right, in the sense that, just to take the media as an example, there was a mainstream in the 1990s, you had a broad consensus on the truth, the means of production were not open to creators, creators couldn't connect with their audiences, creators couldn't monetize their audiences directly. They had to go via the platforms who would sell eyeballs, get advertising, and a small chunk of that would reach creators. And I think all that has changed and it's changed for good, in the sense that I now have the means of production in my hand, I can write something and publish it today, I can put out this podcast today as I will, you know, this is I own this, this is not for any platform, it's available everywhere, and it's free, right, I can make anything in the audiovisual form that I want to and put it on YouTube or whatever. And I think that is not going to change the means of production are with you forever, the means of distribution are accessible to you forever, there might be, I think worries that will get addressed with times that some video creators may feel that they are too dependent on the algorithms of the big platforms like YouTube or whatever, and they might have to cater to that to get noticed. But many creators don't even give a damn about that they're just putting their work out and they're getting their audiences. So in that sense, I don't think we'll mess it up. I think yes, there will be a percentage of creators who are doing cutting edge work today and who are being disruptive, who might be co opted and who might become part of that mainstream game. But overall, we're not going to mess it up. Because unless a human species dies, dies out, which will happen eventually, given the law of extremely large numbers is inevitable. But apart from that, I think that this is an irrevocable change. And that's why it feels creators like me and Roshan and many of the creators I've spoken to on my podcast, with incredible optimism about at least this, that they can't take this away."

But compared to, and liberalization had its own, you know, ups and downs or whatever. I will just say that the 2000s seem to be more welcoming to the younger generation. Now that energy is there, I see fewer outlets though, you know, and that always puts upon a generation the burden of going out and making their own spaces. So I would say that everything out there is poised and set up to thrive. Politically speaking, it's not just a question of, you know, which party's in charge, but I think in general, it hasn't been a priority out here to make your cities into great creative bastions. Does that make sense? And again, I'm not talking about things like, you know, museums and stuff like that. It's just that with the ebb and flow of the city, there was a point at which even the outside spaces seemed to have something to them, you know, a little welcomingness. In order to create and to be a thriving creative community, you also have to be open to mingling and moving past certain barriers and all of that. And I find that happening much more online than offline. Again, you know, we're walking back into these arguments are large and gigantic, but I think what both of us are seeing, what I see from the world of legacy publishing and legacy media is a certain level of fatigue. You know, certain institutions, including some of the ones where I work in, where my work comes out, are as professional and as thorough and as ever, and bless them for being around.

But in my mind, I think all of that is fused with memories of Bangladesh coming into being. And the earliest memories I have are by and large of very happy things, you know, books, houses that were built practically of books, running around and playing in gardens. And because both my parents and my grandmother in Kolkata were exceptionally hospitable people, there was, we were used to a house that where the doors were open, where there was always an extra space at the table, and where people were welcome to come and just crash. And in retrospect, I think it gave me tremendous exposure to a life outside of just the family. You know, otherwise, we get caught up very strongly in our own family histories and all of that. And another thing I didn't realize was, we mentioned earlier, that I felt lucky to be belong to a family where so many people were readers. But of my grandmothers, one of them was a woman who had studied Sanskrit, and loved reading Mills and Boones. So you were introduced right from the start to the idea that reading could be wide and eclectic and didn't have to be either solemn or frivolous all the time, there was a huge spectrum, a kind of keyboard in between. And my father's mother, Takuma, used to write poems in Bengali. And that brought in a certain, you know, comfort with moving between languages as easily as you move between the rooms of a household. And I think a large part of my childhood was, we discussed this as well, it would be so alien to this time, it wasn't structured, none of our childhoods were, there was the broad and very loose structure of a school. And then you come back, you do a little homework. But in the absence of TV and smartphones, and all of that, we were thrown back on our own inventiveness. So the games that we played also came out of one's imagination. And I grew up partly in a government colony in Delhi, at a time when being a government officer was not seen as so much as a emblem of power. You know, it was a kind of time when a secretary to the government of India would drive his car around the neighborhood, picking up lowly deputy secretaries and very, very junior probationers and ferry them all off. And if he didn't do that, in fact, the lowly probationers would get on their cycles and cycle off to work. So being in the government was pretty humble. And the India of that time, the 1970s and the 80s was both quieter and smaller. It still rippled with a current of political tension all through. But it was very much a nation making itself with the memory of Gandhi, Ambedkar, and, you know, all of the heroes of the freedom movement very much alive. That I think has changed over time. Most of my childhood was spent, I think, just being extraordinarily lucky in every possible way. We had a lot of adventures. We were allowed as a family to accompany my father on his tours, so long as he paid for us separately, which he was very punctilious about. And as a result, my first sense of travel was not, you know, a tour, was not you go to a hill station. It was literally of just going across the country and right from the start seeing that enormous variation. I think part of my memory of India as an essentially kind and open country, though, also comes from that time. Something that I found a little disconcerting on my first visit to Europe, where for all the beauty of the place, you don't stop on the street and ask for directions and have that immediately turned into a long and rambling conversation and an invitation to come home, or at least to have a cup of tea together. And for all that, we talk often of the direction that the country is going in today, our fears for the future, our fears for democracy. But when I look back at that time, it doesn't seem romanticized to say that there's an openness that's also part of the Indian spirit. And that is felt and experienced. You know, I don't want to romanticize villages and cities. Part of the research that I did for Black River, among other things, just showed me that almost all of our spaces are unselfconsciously segregated, either by class, often by community, usually by caste, right? And that's what we grew up in. That's the norm that we're used to. But cutting against that, one of the good things about being part of a government colony is that while in that era, certainly caste was not porous, you know, I think the majority of people who were in government colonies at that time were probably upper caste or at least privileged caste in some way or the other. But it was a first introduction to the melting pot aspect of India. And as much as we say, hey, listen, don't go back into nostalgic fantasies about the secular past, I think we're using the wrong word out there. There is an extraordinary diversity in this country. And that was part of my memories from the get-go. In Calcutta, it wasn't that we were just listening to Bengali and English. There were also Marwari friends. There were friends from the Armenian, the very small but extremely vibrant Armenian and Parsi communities. English itself divided into several categories. There was the beauty of Anglo-Indian English, which I think is a little close to the Bombay variants and all of that. And in Delhi, I remember being struck by the fact that there was no one Hindi. We grew up to a certain extent, assimilating newsreader, All India Radio, you know, Hindi and Doordarshan News Hindi. But the other stream was also coming off Bombay through Amitabh Bachchan's movies and Rajesh Khanna's movies. And then there was the many, many Hindis that you'd pick up across the city. Old Delhi had its own slightly courtly, a little Lucknowi, a little Allahabadi Hindi. And the migrant Hindi of the streets was coming straight in from Bihar. I could hear my own state Bengal also in the voices of people out there. So you grew up accustomed, I think, to many tongues ringing in your ears. I didn't have a very happy time in the first school that I was in, Noretto Convent. I made a lot of friends, as is the Roy habit. But it was a slightly austere, you know, you must go abide by the rules. And Kiran Desai's got a little section in Inheritance of Loss about what it's like to be a child suddenly realising that some adults are cruel, and they're cruel just because they can be and they have that kind of power over you. But my life really opened up when I went to La Martiniere. Can I just digress a second here to talk about how much we owe our first teachers, whether they're at the workplace or whether they're in school. So we had some extraordinary teachers. There was Doita Dutta, who became India's first mastermind and we all very chuffed that, you know, a woman had picked up that quiz title. Subsequently related to you by marriage as well. Yes, my husband's cousin. And Indra Sen Gupta, who taught us all about the Constitution, and maybe some of my love for the Constitution comes from those early lessons. And Sumita D, who was our English teacher, brought the Grapes of Wrath, which was the text that we were studying that year in class 11, alive in this classroom in Calcutta in a way where suddenly there was a sense of connection, you know, Steinbeck's molten anger over the kind of waste that was happening, the squeezing of the migrants into smaller and smaller spaces, the relentlessness of keeping them on the road. What does that remind you of? What did we go through last year? Those early lessons just brought home to me, we've talked so much about the joy of reading, the joy of writing, the uses of it. But something I want to say, literature is not an abstraction. You know, it's not just a frill added to life. It is often something that does more than just witness or document. It is really a living thing in itself. And Steinbeck's book, I was reading that at the same time that I was reading, I just about started reading in Bengali again after years of absence. And I was reading Vibhuti Bhushan's Pother Panchali and Tagore's Gora at the same time. And it came to me that there's an unselfconscious political novel. We think of the political novel today in very limited ways in India. It's a novel that makes a statement. It's a novel that's in effect, I don't want to diminish people's enthusiasm for writing this. I don't want to be unkind. But a novel is not an editorial, right? It is much more than that. What Tagore was doing, what Vibhuti was doing in his story of Upu coming out of a very poor village and at that he had a Brahmin protagonist, but a Brahmin protagonist who was encountering the city for the first time and trying to find his place in it and sometimes dealing with an incredible loneliness of the soul and the spirit and sometimes just riveted to the promise of the city. It's such a contemporary book in that sense. And Tagore went straight into this question of identity with Gora. You know, I don't know whether you've read the novel. It was a very popular Bengali serial at one time. And Tagore just dealt with the dynama of a man who believes that he is a nationalist, that the country should be left to only a certain kind of persons. And then he realizes that the secret of his birth makes him the outsider that he's always been reeling against in part. I'm summarizing terribly, but he wasn't afraid to go into these big questions. His novels are political statements in the sense that the word politics is intricately involved with the life of the people, right? And I think writers like Tagore, filmmakers like Shatrujit Ray, I'm speaking only of my part of the country now, but I'm also thinking of Govind Nihalani, I'm thinking of the many films that Om Puri acted in. That was the water that we were swimming in, you see. It was, if it was intellectual, then I think it was unselfconsciously intellectual. And those big ideas were also mass available in a way that I think has changed a little bit over time. I went straight from, I went to Stephens for English literature and I remember the only way that I could justify that choice because there wasn't going to be a job at the end of it, was just being aware that I was happy because I was following my heart. And then being a little dismayed because following my heart turned out to mean a lot of Dryden and Chaucer, and at first I really struggled with that. We were reading these texts in a vacuum. Even though we had some incredibly gifted teachers, it took professors like Arjun Mahe and Vikey Sharma, who passed away in my third year out there, to draw the map of connections and to let you know that Shakespeare was, in a sense, Kalidasa's blood brother. That Chaucer sitting at his inn, spinning his stories, and you can make a parallel in a different way with Krishna Subti collecting all of life around her in Chandni Chowk. And I'm not sure that any of the classical education did much for me, but a lot of my Stephen's education happened actually on the lawns of Hindu College and wandering around to other parts of Delhi University, witnessing in embryo a lot of the debates that would start to rock India. The Mandal agitation happened in the final year of our college. And I think a certain percentage of the university was automatically and self-righteously against reservations. It took a lot for people to turn around and look at the composition of their own colleges and say, aren't we all upper caste here? And how did that happen? And isn't there something that is owed to people who did not have everything that we take so casually for granted, whether that is a physical thing like the presence of books in the house or access to English or good education, or whether that is something a little more intangible or confidence, the fact that your surname is its own passport or even if it doesn't open doors for you, it doesn't close doors in your face. And I don't think that was an easy reckoning for most people because we believe so strongly in the myth of our own merit. You know, we believe that because we have worked hard, we do not see that other people not even allowed to step into the zone where you can start working hard. So all of that swirl was happening. I joined the business standard rather than do a PhD. The truth to tell, I was at MA for my JNU and I had this marvellous professor Meenakshi Mukherjee who was a translator and a critic and a professor, very much one of those whose engagement with writing came from an active immersion in literature as it is practiced. And she kept an open curious mind right to the end, had a rousing punch up with Vikram Chandra on the subject of authenticity and what is an authentic Indian writer. And even when she lost an argument or was in the wrong, I think it was the joy of getting into the ring that stays with me. And at some point, I think she gently pointed out to me that doing a PhD, which is the track that I was on. Also, in parenthesis, we Indians are so much about life tracks, right? You have to be doctor, lawyer, engineer, IAS. And if you're a writer, then you're carefully steered towards BA in India, MA abroad and PhD America, you know. And then she drew my attention to the content of what I was going to study. And that was literary theory of the most high flown there is the unkind, which I have to admit that I was completely unsuited to. And she said, why do you want to study further with English? And I think for the first time in my life, I said, because I love the literature of it. And I love the fact that most translation happens in English. So it's not just English, it opens up all of the languages of the world to me. And someday I want to write my own books. And I think it was the first time I'd said that aloud and I was a little shocked by this unseemly impractical ambition. And she said, whatever else you do, don't do a PhD, go out and work for a bit. Try your hand at being a journalist or in publishing or something, get a practical sense of life. But don't kill yourself by disappearing down the wonderful, but for me, perhaps not nourishing fields of Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha and the rest of it. And so I tried out for every job that I could find. I briefly taught at nursery school as a teacher. I was a paralegal and I worked on the early version of Durex, which is what became the Lexis database. And I was absorbed in the different, we've talked about this, I think, as friends once or twice. But I was just fascinated by the thought that crime changes according to the part of the country that you come from. And in a sense, you know, we're conformist. In one part of the country, you have to push people down wells in order to kill them. And in the other, it's a little bit of a social solacism. If you murder somebody using anything else but a gandasa or an axe, you're not really supposed to pick up a country made pistol. And Bengal was given to poisonings, for example, UP, parts of it favoured the country made pistol, which was very sporting because that had an equal chance of blowing up in the hand of the would-be murderer and, you know, taking him down. And there were places where you simply chop people into pieces, inevitably burying a body in your own backyard, thereby giving the police a chance to put you behind bars. But it all had the sense of being extremely ritualistic. I was deeply fascinated and then, for reasons known only to themselves, business standard employed me. And I think that was such, I was so lucky in retrospect, not just because between people like TN9 and Tony Joseph, Pratik Kanjilal, Kanika Dutta, some of my editors out there, there were people who taught me skill, yes, and the craft of reporting and the whole thing of go back and double-check a source. From Tony, I learned something invaluable, which is that the most articulate person in a room is not necessarily the person who knows the most. Sometimes it's the quiet people standing around whom you really need to interview. Tony also taught me about multiple perspectives, you know, never take anything for granted, just go back and check and recheck and all of that. And because I was obviously useless at the economics and finance side of things, and I was never going to make a political journalist, I was put on the arts beat. It seems extraordinary because we give so much space over to so many things. But in those days, the art section was about a 10-page, 12-page section, you know, and about three of those pages were on the arts directly. So my job was utterly delightful. It was to go out and meet people in this new India of the then early 1990s, who were teaching themselves an idiom that was both Indian and international. And the other part of the job, which I loved so much, was to go down to the publishing houses, which were in those days, all in a row in Daryaganj, in the middle of those crowded Delhi streets with bazaars that had gone back to literally the 17th or 14th century around them, and pick up books that were suitable for review or extract. I was in absolute heaven, but it was only later that I realized that I'd lucked into an organization that also prized integrity. These sound like such old-fashioned things, don't they? Like I said, legacy person. Yeah. You have to stop me when I'm running on and on though."

        "message": "I'm going to repeat that, just stop me anytime that I start overflowing the banks or whatever. But it was a great introduction to the city as well. And if you want to know what Delhi was like at that time, this was the early 90s. We were just beginning to feel the beat and the pulse of liberalization and most of that was felt in the dismantling of the License Raj that held people back so terribly. I see a little bit of a parallel to that now. We were talking about the creative economy earlier. And some of the barriers in place, whether it's a tax barrier or whether it's just the absence of resources that help somebody who doesn't already have a network of power and influence to join in, you know. Some of those to see those come down at that time and to see the breath of a fresh energy. Delhi's a city built around a cluster of small and ancient villages. And in that time, Bina Rahmani changed the landscape entirely by taking over the house cars village and setting up restaurants out there. And of course, there was a lot of Delhiwala's ooing and aahing over the cuteness of seeing cows and buffaloes as they went off for expensive dinners facing the house car snake. But I think she actually started something that allowed us to knit our past and our hopeful future together. Delhi was a very anxious city. You know, if you look at it from a psychic point of view, I think it was always comparing itself either to the slick sophistication of Bombay or it was hoping someday to be like a London or New York, but aware that it was lagging behind. And it takes some time to understand that you're sitting in a century, you know, you're living in a city that is literally built on the centuries. When I walk around the city today, sometimes it seems populated with writers either living or by the ghosts of writers. You know, across the road, there's Amir Khosrow, down the road from my house, there's Rahim Khan of the Dohas. And in more contemporary terms in Sujan Singh Park, there's Khushwant Singh, across the river in Mayur Vihar, there's a school of younger writers who cut their teeth in places like Lajpat Nagar or Paharganj or whatever it is. And when you live in a city like that, it's not about whether writing is doing well, which seems to be sometimes the only question we're asking of writing, you know, that anxiety of performance. It's a city that just breeds stories under the roughness, under the aggression. And the aggression is a serious thing. And I think I just jumped into that life. Even as a newly married woman, my experience of the city was tremendous independence. None of us could afford fancy houses and we all lived clustered in versatis or in the first floor of a tumbling bungalow, you know, that kind of thing. And we all ate khichdi towards the end of the month when the budget was running out. And we were all incredibly happy. And what we talked about was books and film and music. And again, in our homes, what flowed was multiple languages, multiple ways of seeing. At some point, the Hindi and the English worlds of the city became a little segregated, you know. The English book launches happened at fancy five star hotels. And we lost something that used to be an organic connection between the Hindi, Urdu, English worlds, Punjabi as well. These four languages used to move in and out of each other's lives. I think when I started off as a young journalist, if you were on the arts beat, you were expected to be bilingual. It wasn't said, it wasn't stated upfront. But it was assumed that if you were Indian, you would have at least one other language at your command. And I don't want to lecture people at all, because I am not truly, I write only in English. I don't write in Bengali, because I don't live in Calcutta. And I feel very strongly that it's best to write in a language that you're surrounded by. I don't write in Hindi because there's a great love for that language, but I really don't have the literary heft to even attempt that. But I think our lives are poorer for living in only one language when we have so much choice and when we are surrounded by so much. Gitanjali Shree said this recently with Tomb of Sand, when she won the International Booker. And her first thing was not a triumphalism about the language that she writes in, which is Hindi, but just a reminder that we are lucky in a way that maybe we don't see so easily. We live in a country where there are a thousand streams of literatures, languages, some big, some limited to just 100 speakers or so. But you know, being aware of that stream or living only in English is also not the best"

        "message": "choice you could make. So many strands to pick up on, or should I say many tributaries to go down on, as you've kind of made your path. So here's the first of them. You know, when one of the subjects that I think about more and more is how are we shaped, how are we shaped as people in all the ways that we are shaped. And when I look back on myself as a young man, I realized that the young me 25 years ago was shaped in many ways that I now realize in hindsight by, for example, by just my home, by my parents. I think I, from my mother, I got a sense of social arrogance. From my father, I got a sense of intellectual arrogance, and I got good things from them also like the love of reading and the respect for the arts and all of that, you know. And obviously, once you reflect on yourself and you become conscious of these things, and you can begin to change and eliminate them. But it's interesting to think, you know, how you became what you became. And when I was reading your book, you had this part where you were talking about the Bengali obsession for intellectualism, as it were, you referred to an Amitav Ghosh essay where he wrote about the bong obsession with the Nobel Prize. And there's a certain bongness, certainly in my upbringing, because my mother, of course, was Bengali. And my father was, although Punjabi born in Lahore, but basically from childhood just grew up in Calcutta, where he met my mother and all that. So culturally, completely Bengali and all of that. And that set me to wondering that how much of these qualities, the sort of social arrogance, which partly, of course, came from the privilege of, you know, being located where we were, and the intellectual arrogance, how much of it perhaps was a partly Bengali heritage also? That's really a hard question to answer and almost a rhetorical one. But the question I pose to you is that, when you look back at the way that you were shaped, that what you became, you know, some of those connections are easy to draw. You were, of course, surrounded by books, it was that culture of reading. So of course, you would become a reader, you know, that comes from there. But what else, you know, what are the like, I often think that, you know, we use the term earlier in the conversation, mimetic desire, and I think there can also be mimetic personalities, that what we are is contingent on where we are located, and so much around us, and we don't realize to what extent that there is, we think that we are autonomous in the way that we shape ourselves, that I can be what I want to be. But often, it's not so simple. You know, you earlier referred to how different crimes in different places in the country, different kinds of crimes. And that got me to thinking that, in many ways, geography can be destiny as well, right? How we are shaped is just a combination of all of these things. So at one level, of course, there are the genes that you get. But as Steven Pinker said, you know, nature gives you knobs, nurture turns them. And so beyond what you are born as, you have all these influences around you. So just looking back on yourself, what do you think are those sort of influences which kind of shaped you that in a parallel universe, if they were not there, you might be a completely different person? And then, as a sort of a mirror image of that answer, what do you think is essential to you that even if you were born in a humble Tamil household or in Nigeria, that you would still be this? But you know, so it's sort of a rambling river like question itself, but..."

        "message": "It's a beautiful question. It's a beautiful question because we're getting to something real rather than, you know, the polite faces that we often put on in a formal conversation or an interview. And I think I was aware early on that a lot of the Bengali sense of exceptionalism, some of it was built on something that is really, really beautiful about Calcutta, Bankura, a large part of Bengal, which is the genuine appreciation for life in all its forms and for craft, not as a snobbish, you know, part of life or, you know, they worked so hard on their dancing or their music or whatever, but as a beautiful thing to do with a human life, you know. That stream is very gentle and sometimes subsumed by the fact that Bengal often speaks, as Parimal Bhattacharya reminds you in his book, his recent book, of Bengal as though all of Calcutta is Bengal, and that's absolutely not true. And there's a deep anxiety among Bengalis, which I'm probably going to get a lot of hate mail over this at some point, about being irrelevant, about being left out, no longer, you know, from the time that it stopped being the first city of empire, it's off to a side Bengal likes to think of itself as revolutionary, but just to digress, one of those famous digressions for a second, I put together a small collection from the Modern Review, which was a publication that came out in 1907 and continued till 1950, capturing the years of the freedom struggle, and it was run by my husband's grandfather, Ramananda Babu, Ramananda Chatterjee. The Modern Review itself was an extremely eclectic magazine and it positioned itself not as centrist, but as a magazine that would listen to the Congress, but not always fully agree with them that had space for more than just that, you know, it was somewhere in between. But it was not the only, it was a brilliant endeavor and all of that, but it was only when I started to go into the history of little magazines, that you realize they're everywhere. There isn't a region in India that hasn't had a strong intellectual literary cultural tradition. The whole sense of Bengal as more than the rest does need to be laid to rest, you know. I don't think I have much patience with that intellectual arrogance either. With my own family, I think when you come across family pride, you start to ask yourself after a while what that pride is in. One of our family members, my great-granduncle, was somebody who took an active part in the freedom struggle and was quite a well-known figure in the years immediately after independence. But when that story was told to me, sometimes it seemed that what was important about him was that he was important. When I went into that story, what I found incredibly touching was that like most Indians, he was just one generation out of a village. He was brought up in fairly humble circumstances. His family was neither affluent nor powerful, but they had a kind of integrity, a wholeness to them that they passed on to him. In his relationship with the British before India was independence, he, like a lot of the nationalists, we keep going back to them, he, like a lot of the nationalists, didn't have an arrogance about him. He just had a confidence. I've often looked back at that and thought to myself, where did they have the confidence from when they were told all along, when everything surrounding them said that they were second-class citizens, that Indians were inferior, or that the real version of this, you should be grateful to the British for all that they have done, and you are not fit to govern your own country. And then to assert your own selfhood, that's the part where I feel a kind of associated pride. I find it very difficult to feel ancestral pride per se though, because in that case you're taking credit for somebody else's achievements. What I prize about my heritage is not the cocoon part of it. I prize the fact that there were people in my family for many generations who went where their curiosity led them. And I also prize the people who were willing to be ordinary, you know. But there are parts of your family that you step away from as well, and I don't want to be hurtful to anyone who's listening, but it did take a certain amount of reckoning to say that maybe it's best to put aside a certain belief that we have made it on our own. You know, if you are born into certain things because of an accident of birth and whatever that is, that might be financial privilege, it is often in this country majoritarian privilege. You have had it easier than others, and it takes away nothing from what you see as the successes of your own life to just acknowledge that. You don't have to, you know, cringe about it, but you do have to see that it was not because of your efforts that you were born into a circumstance where you could, you know, access a good education or whatever. I think the one thing that was surprising about our lives though is because my grandfather died the year I was born, my mother's father, I never knew him. I only knew of him, he was a judge who loved the law. I think we took it for granted that we were brought up by a matriarch, and it was only years later when a cousin of mine pointed that out that I said, okay, maybe one of the reasons why I think that women should be in control is partly because of this. What is just me? I think my stubbornness, actually, more than anything else. You know, the rest of it, if you peel away the privileges, would I have been a reader, would I have been a writer? I really don't know. I really don't think so. If I'd been married off and I was 16 or 17 or deprived of education, maybe I would have thought that that was the right part. Where I find myself on the shakiest ground is actually with some of the principles that I feel so deeply, you know, the belief in democracy, the love of a nation that is a diverse nation that has space for everybody equally. And I honestly cannot tell, this is such a terrible confession to make, but it's a very honest confession. If I'd been brought up in a family that thought it was okay and natural to be bigoted, to discriminate against whoever else, whoever else was not like you, you know, non-Hindus, Muslims, anyone else, really, there's a shifting state always to that, women who read too much. Would I have just imbibed that water? Would I have not questioned it? Something that Samit Basu, who was again a Delhi writer, says, and I think it's in The City Inside or he said it in an interview. He pointed out that no matter how independent and free we all think we are, it is surprising and illuminating that so many of us take on the professions prescribed to us by our caste identities, you know. So a certain kind of, it's not to do with Bengali-ness anymore, but we instinctively, you know, gravitate to this person is an accountant or that person is a teacher, not realizing that it is the ancient shadow of caste somehow making itself felt. So maybe we have a little less agency out here. The part of me that is completely my own aside from the stubbornness, I think no matter what I would have been creative. And by creative, I don't mean that shallowly. I mean that I think most humans are born into a sense of play, which is the first foundation for creativity, a sense of questioning, which may be rapidly shut down, but it's there. And a sense of wonder, those three things, okay. And I think there's something in me that just refuses to roll over and die, no matter what other minor challenges I've gone through, whatever it is. I mean, in my childhood, for example, there was one person, a much, much older, not my father or uncles or brothers, but somebody who was an older relative, who was extraordinarily abusive when I was about eight, and the period from eight to 12 was darkened by that abuse. And the shadow of that abuse also took me a long, long while to work through in my twenties and thirties. I don't mean this, again, to be overgrateful, but at different times in my life, particularly when I was a reporter on The Gender Beat, and I met a lot of women who were traumatized for similar reasons or who were in either facing domestic violence or facing the big me too that we don't have the space for, which is the number of people who are abused as agricultural laborers or as factory workers. And there's a prohibition against seeking help. And there is no availability of the resources that you need. And I always had the choice to find the help that I needed, and to use creative ways to move through whatever experiences had been distressing, you see."

        "message": "So here's my next question, which picks up from a couple of the things that you sort of mentioned, including where we just ended. There's this lovely passage about your Didima in your book, where you write, you could trace a historical development of women's romances by studying the gradual shift from outback love and doctor and nurse romances through the Greek millionaire and Italian count phase up to the modern phenomenon of soft core erotica and doctor-doctor romances. Didima disapproved of the erotica on the Umberto Eco principle that porn got in the way of a good story. But she liked the egalitarianism of doctors dating rather than doctors hitting on nurses. In his office and his bedroom, my uncle maintained an eclectic collection of paperbacks on subjects as varied as Tibetan Buddhism, physics via the dancing bully masters, classical music and jazz, and his passion architecture, stop quote. And what sort of struck me here was how their reading is kind of different, right? And I was recently in Chandigarh, my dad had died last year. So we were clearing away his house and just looking at the last remnants and seeing what we wanted and what we didn't want. And I came across a lot of letters, which I have kept from my mother to my father, none the other way around, but letters from my mom to my dad all the way from the 1980s onwards. And they were very interesting, because one of the things I realized was that all through their marriage, they were desperately lonely people, right? And it was a sort of they were separately lonely, and it was the marriage was a kind of mutual loneliness. And in a sense, it was not something either of them could have helped in the sense, I think my mother was sort of there, not out of choice, but that's just the way marriages worked. And my father's loneliness in a sense for self inflicted, but what is self inflicted and what is not and how much agency do people have and how much are they slaves of the ways in which they are shaped is all open to question. And that sort of got me to thinking about like, for me, in an ideal marriage, your partner has to be your best friend, or at least a very close friend, right? It's about that companionship is essential. But I realized that all through the decades and all through human history until now, certainly in India, it's not been that way. It's sort of been instrumental, that they are playing roles. And therefore, in a sense, you play those roles, and there isn't sort of that friendship or that communication or whatever. And women are circumscribed to what those roles are. I did an episode with Peggy Mohan, who wrote that wonderful book about the evolution of languages. And there also there is an interesting sort of learning that also points to this, where she points out that when the Aryans first came to India, they were whether you call them migrants or invaders or whatever, it was men only, right? Because all their travelers, migrants, whatever, they would be hordes of men, and they would marry local women, whether by force or not, we don't know. But whatever, they would marry local women. And Peggy's point was a point about language, but a point about much else, which is that therefore, the languages they spoke would be different languages, that the women of a family would speak a particular kind of language, and the men would speak a particular kind of language. And initially, of course, it would be because the languages are different. But then gradually, it kind of remained this way. So a little child growing up when a boy would be with the mother, he would learn a bit of the mother's language, but then he would be in a men's world and he would learn the other language while the girls would grow up and continue learning that kind of language. And this also seems a powerful metaphor for a kind of separation that is sort of there. And just sort of going back to what you said about your grandmother and how she's reading a particular kind of books and your uncle is reading a different kind of book."

        "message": "What you were picking up on there was actually something that was incredibly formative for me even though I didn't realize it. You know, in our schooling, we were often not schooling, but in our colleges, certainly, we often taught that there's a difference between high and low literature. And a lot of even Hindi literature or Bengali literature marks a little distinction, a little snobbery thing, you know, that's cheap literature, that's bestsellers, in the same way that English does. And because I had so much respect for my grandmother, not as my grandmother, but as a person, she had an incredibly open mind. By which I mean that when she first encountered the concept of LGBT relationships, rather than being shocked as many people in her generation were and saying that's forbidden. She was extremely curious about this. This was about 20 years before the laws changed in India. And she asked me, she said, do you think that it is possible for you to fall in love with a woman? And I said, I think if all of us were given those options, wouldn't we, you know, wouldn't you? She said, it was just off the table, but I'm seeing now that it's a broad table. And if you put it back on, then anything is possible. And she thought about it, went away. And then the next day, you know, doing her rounds at Newmarket and doing a little bit of volunteer work and whatever it was that the women of that time did. She comes back and she says, this whole thing about gender, again, this is happening 20 years, 30 years before these debates. How much of being a man or being a woman are we taught and how much of it is innate? Some of it, I guess, is innate. But isn't there a huge teaching that happens with just, you know, having to take off our moustaches if we are women. She fixated on that, you know, or brush our moustaches out if we are men. This whole thing about effeminate men and all of that. And we were discussing the gender spectrum before there was a gender spectrum. I'm not saying that she was a revolutionary or anything, but she was my friend, you know. And what her being able to move so seamlessly between Sanskrit texts and the great classics on one hand, and the full, you know, Tagoreana and everything that we were steeped in, and then say, this is what I like reading. I like reading these romances. She read them almost like travel brochures. Because in an age when people didn't travel that much, your mills and boons were the ones that took you off to Australia or whatever. She had a sharp sense of race as well. She did say that she felt that, you know, it was filled with these white protagonists. And then after a while in our minds, when we were reading them, we turned everyone of different races into our own race unconsciously. My uncle, my aunts, the fact that everybody was free to choose their own literature, stands to me as one of the greatest privileges of them all. Because over time, I've met so many writers, particularly some of the younger women writers, who grew up in households either where there wasn't a book available, or where the reading was very sternly prescribed. You know, you might have had your bookshelves filled with great literature, but you were supposed to read only that. And you were supposed to read it at particular times. Aside from the fact that reading is expensive, as in people have to buy books, and expensive in terms of time, if you're a reader, one of the reasons why women have such a barrier about reading even today in this country, is because it automatically means that you have leisure. And for women and men, I think there's a great suspicion, particularly for women, but also for men, about this whole thing of having free time. That means privacy. That means you're thinking thoughts in your head, and experiencing things that are moving far beyond the ambit that the family has set for you. I think they taught me not to be a snob. And over the years, with my own reading, often this happens with when I became a writer, and I was interviewed as a writer, people would ask, and what are the books that shaped you? And I mentioned, you know, some of my old favorites, because you have to be, it's not fair to weight this game by mentioning writers who make you look good. You should be honest about your own reading at least, right? So I'd mentioned the Garcia Marquez's and the Toni Morrison's Rushdie, or whoever, because they were such great influences. But I'd also mentioned the pulp fiction, you know, the really cheesy science fiction, or the shady Bengali detective fiction, or the, you know, those Hindi confessional stories that used to happen in women's magazines about women's lives, all very dramatically punched up and etc. And inevitably, when the interview came out, only the books that made me look like a writer person would be left in the text. You see what I mean? I mean, there was a, I'm sure that my interviewers didn't mean to do this deliberately, but it's like unconsciously in our minds, when we think of reading, we divide it into worthy and unworthy. You asking a more sensitive question, though, about intimate family relationships, was that"

But I think at some point, layers begin to peel off and you realize that no, this is not how it should be. And you begin to view the world differently. Maybe over time, you developed frames of seeing the world in a particular way. So it's like a dual question, almost, which is partly about, or let's just narrow it down to one question, which is about how was your consciousness of all of this? And over the years, how did your feminism thereby evolve? Because I guess, you know, when I did my episode with Mrinal Pandey, she mentioned that when she was 13 or something, she had an argument with her mother, because she felt that her mother was spending too much time obsessing over the meal she would cook for Mrinalji's dad. And she was like, why are you doing this is food is not that important. Why don't you? Why are you so stressed all the time about the food? And that's like a feminist instinct. But at that point, as she said, she hadn't read about feminism, she wouldn't have known the term, she wouldn't have, you know, been able to put a frame to it. So now in your sense, one, of course, you are brought up by a matriarch, as it were, or have these role models around you, whose lived experience is an experience, perhaps to some extent of not conforming to their roles, and perhaps to some extent, of, you know, making those roles expand and fill out around them. But, you know, we've spoken a lot about Nilanjana Roy, the reader, but if we are to talk about Nilanjana Roy, the feminist, tell me a bit about that, where, you know, how do you look at the lived feminism of people around you in many small ways, the fights that they fight, and what were the frameworks that you then began to develop? And did it not at some point in time, being in India, and so on and so forth, leave you with a profound sense of anger as well?"

        "message": "And if so, how did you deal with that anger? My feminism did not come from the family. In the family, there were many useful role models, I realized later that the real gifts of the family, for example, was that they took love, even in the middle of heated arguments and quarrels and differences of opinion, for granted. There was an equality between my father, who passed away last year, and my mother, in the sense that they were both free to quarrel with each other when they disagreed. And they were partners, they were companions. My father wholeheartedly and his father, surprisingly, you know, my Thakurda, who was a manager for Andrew Yule in Cuttack, and then lived with my parents for some years and brought Bengali and many other things into our lives. He was a very gentle man. I grew used, I grew a little spoiled by the fact that I would not call the men in my family feminists per se, but they were men who saw women as equals, you know. And that spoiled me a little bit for the rest of the world. It was often a shock in my early work to encounter men who were misogynists. I had been corseted, and I had been fortunate also in school by and large, not to come across too much in the way of misogyny, where it showed for my mother was that she was part of the generation who were expected to be superwomen. So she became a lawyer at 39. And I think we were a little bit of family mythology around that, you know. Before that, she'd done various things. She taught in nursery schools. She was a fantastic mother in the sense that she used to just pick up whatever random friends of ours and us were wandering around the neighborhood and take us off on adventures and excursions. So one day we'd be swimming, or we'd be going to the Kutum Minar and exploring things. And my family was a family of women drivers. Most of the men drove terribly, and almost all of the women drove well. And I remember one of my first feelings of deep independence was actually learning to drive at probably an illegal age, you know. And my mother taught me, and my grandmother refined that teaching. My grandmother was also a crack driver. And being a crack driver, being a decent shot, that kind of stuff, was not feminism, but it made you feel like you were holding your own in a world that you could already see was unequal. Where it felt really unfair was at a very early age, I felt circumscribed by all these rules about, you can't go out on the road, you have to take your brother with you, you have to do this, you have to do that. Everything that was there for our safety, particularly in Delhi, I felt it like a blow. In Calcutta, at least, I was reasonably free. By evening, you had to come back in any Indian city, you know, that was the unspoken rule for a young Indian woman. The first time that I was pushed around and hurt or molested on the street, I think it comes as a shock, and then you realize that you have to defend yourself against it. And in a sense, that molesting carries a little bit of egalitarianism against, you know, unless you're cocooned in an air-conditioned car all your life, it's something that you're going to experience as a woman. But from a very early age, I was sharply aware, not of the territory of feminism, you know, we were brought up with this myth of women and men were equal. And even in my family, the women would bring the food out of the kitchen, or if the staff was doing that, the women would still be the ones hovering, the men didn't hover. The men didn't feed everyone else at the table. And those little subtle things are where you see that, you know, no matter how much you progressed, there is still territory that's not as equal as it seems, if that makes sense. The women were expected to hold down a career and come back and be perfect hostesses, be mother and do this, you know, there was always an and, the men didn't have an and, they could just be one thing or the other and somebody would make sure that the shirts were starched. You see what I mean? It's in the body that you feel it. I was a child who lived so deeply in my mind, you know, not just in the imagination, but I think in a mind that I've talked to Manjula about this, Manjula Padmanabhan, who's another of the Delhi writers whom I admire very much, Ursula K. Le Guin's talked about the non-gendered mind, the fact that when you're creating something, you're deeply immersed in studying something. Your mind has no gender at that time, it's beyond gender, you know. And often living in an Indian city, wherever you were, felt like being rudely and violently pushed back into your body. That only enhanced when I became, that sense became doubly enhanced when I was a reporter. And I found myself sometimes to my absolute fury being dependent on the goodwill of photographers for my safety or dependent on the concern of editors for my safety. And as much as I was glad that they were caring, part of me really resented it, really resented having to be dependent. I experienced the difference between the genders in India first, not as a battle or as an ideology, but as territory, you see. So to me, even now, the city has a gendered geography. Wherever I go, even in the mountains, I walk fairly fearlessly all across. I walked for years. I think, you know, part of writing a book is not the book itself. It's what you discover on the way to writing a book, a lot of which you will discard. I was diffident about writing a certain section in Black River, which has to do with the Yamuna itself and the people who live on its banks. And so to get over that diffidence, I walked the length of as much of the Yamuna as I could to just learn it spatially. Even if it's not for the book, you know, it might come out into just a chapter or a couple of sentences. You're doing that really for yourself. You're learning a part of your city that you would not know anything about or a part of your country or a part of your history that you would not know anything about otherwise. And in that time, I've experienced aggressive acts in the Aravalis and the Yamuna maybe three times on all those walks. And each time has been unpleasant and mercifully, you know, not very serious. But each time my guides to whether a territory was safe or unsafe for the women. So when you're walking around the Aravalis trying to learn, you know, part of that landscape, the women will tell you, this is absolutely safe until 3 p.m. But after 3 p.m., you know, the men come in and they'll sit there and just be careful. And the first thing they'll say is, are you on your own and language is a protection. If you come across as English speaking and from a very, very obviously, you know, privileged background. If you're a wandering woman, then either you're mad, you know, like Laldi, then the saints of old or you're exceptionally privileged, you know, we carry that with us like a badge and it becomes your safety, that layer of privilege or whatever. Walking is stressful, but it became my way of pushing back. I think, you know, we all have these quiet battles. Meanwhile, the river of feminism that's flowed, I think I'm sometimes troubled by this. We act as though the battles of the past are over and they are not. Nobody talks about dowry debts today. It's moved to a different corner of sexual violence. You know, when I was a reporter at the New York Times, bear with me because these are apparently disconnected, but they actually lining up in a row. When I was a reporter at the New York Times, we found ourselves, me and my editor, Jean Moore, who was an absolute genius of an editor. She had this way of not making your story hers, but of asking the right questions and pushing you in the right direction and turning an opinion piece into more of a reported piece. She wanted to make sure that what you were seeing was really the truth of the landscape that you were looking at or the truth of people's lives. And she taught me to be respectful to the people whom we were talking to, whether they were the victims of violence or whether they were women who were surrogate mothers or whether they were homeless women on the streets. And we kept running into this story. We kept trying to do other stories on gender and kept running into that first wave of mainstream ritualized street violence, you know, and that was just a reflection of the dowry debts of an earlier time. That violence and that belief that women are somehow inferior, that, you know, you can be killed if you don't bring enough to a marriage or as happened with the more sophisticated evolution of dowry debts. You could be killed if you had contributed as much as your family was able to contribute and then it was time for the next bride to come in, you see. The street violence was coming in more or less as a reaction to a phenomenon of those times, which was that women were moving more around, they were moving out of their houses, they were migrating more, they were taking up jobs. And this wave of violence was the pushback. And despite that, women kept coming until the economy tightened, the cultural and social politics also changed. And one of the great tragedies of our time, it's been reported, but to my mind a little underreported given everything else that's going on, is the fact that women have receded in every way from the economic space, from public spaces as such, you know, from, there's a movement backwards in that sense. I think I realized very early on that my view as, you know, often we name check privilege, but I don't mean to do that. I just mean that literally if you grew up as an upper caste Hindu woman, then there are many things that you are simply not going to see. So a lot of feminism for me, whether I was listening to Gloria Steinem or bell hooks or Indian rich abroad, or whether I was reading or learning about the work of grassroots movements out here in India from Chipko to, you know, the major caste movements to the major movements of organized labor. Those have been written and reported about, but again, they aren't mainstream as such. I think I took a step back from feminist activism myself. My role has been much more the participant, the observer in all of these protests. And sometimes, you know, the speaker, but I've never felt that, I've always felt that it's a good idea to pass the mic to people who are actually there engaging with struggles on the ground, rather than to hand the mic to someone like me, who's just witnessing or observing. But the other thing that I learned was again from the women who are sometimes most deeply engaged in this kind of struggle. This was just before the December protests in India of 2012 over the murder of Jyoti, the young woman on the bus who was so brutally raped and then killed for the crime of just being out to see a movie and being available and being there and being unprotected. And before that, for two years, there had been this running wave of protests all across the rural parts of Haryana and Jind, you know. Those protests were grievous. I cannot tell you how many tragedies were folded into, were laid behind those protests. I met fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, whose lives had been devastated by the casual murders or rapes or dismemberments of the women that they held dear. And somehow, despite that, every protest that you'd go to, somebody would bring out a drum, somebody would be playing music, somebody would be singing protest songs. And I remember the second time I joined in this, this was in Jind, it must have showed on my face that I was surprised at this, where were the serious speeches, where was the one-minute silence. And the women just looked at me and said, we're not protesting to be sad, we're protesting for better lives, we're protesting in order to be happy. And whatever else we can't claim, you know, we can't claim equal rights, we can't claim the right even to be safe in our own homes or out on the streets, but we can claim the right to be happy in this moment. And that was, you know, that was a very powerful learning for me. I think most of my relationship with feminism has come from there. And historically speaking, this is where being a reader comes in handy. I think, you know, the idea that how most of the feminist victories have been won, women are equal, what are they crying about now, in one way or the other that comes up, MeToo is where our attention is focused at this time. But it is certainly not the only battle around, you know, from reproductive rights to the right to education, whatever you wear, or whatever community you come from, which has been such a big thing in India right now, and in Afghanistan and places like that. I think we forget how recent all of this is. Just a few generations back, women in England, in Austin writes about this, did not have the right to own property, because they were property themselves. That entire obsession with marriage that comes through in her books, is basically coming through because women had no life if they could not make a good marriage. And that's where, you know, that underlying all the humor and the lightness of it, and the two inches of ivory, it's not two inches of ivory. You're talking about the lives of generations of women who were nothing and had nothing and could only become governesses or, you know, burdens on their family, if they did not find a man to say yes to them, right? That was pretty recent. I wrote this, I think, as a Facebook post, but I was reading Ram Mohan Roy and Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the 18th century reformers letters the other day. And I think for the first time it struck me, you know, what we know of Raja Ram Mohan Roy is that, yes, he had the laws of Sati changed. It's when you start reading the letters that you realize how long that campaign ran and how exhausting it was on him and his family, you know, because he defended orthodox Hindus who were arguing at that time with perfect logic for the right to keep burning women. I looked at those records and some of the women in the Calcutta district who became Satis not so long ago, this would have been less than, what, five generations, six generations? That's how recent it is. Some of them were 15 years old or 16 years old or 12. And the oldest would have been in their 70s and 80s, you know, facing the pyre. And what horrifies me is not, you know, more evidence of the fact that we can be barbaric, all of us. What horrifies me is that we were willing for the longest time to intellectually justify this and that, you know, the British get a lot of credit for changing the law, but they changed the law only after cautious dipstick checks that there were enough Hindus who would support this, you see. It's only been less than a generation since my own grandmother, my father's mother, her first marriage, which she did not like, happened when she was very young. She was just about, I think, something like 13 or 15. And she extricated herself from that marriage, found an independent life somehow, and married my grandfather many years later. But all of these things are very close. It's not even been a hundred years since women in India won the right to vote. And we were pretty enlightened in our pre-independence debates about that. But there was, even at that time, there was a strand of opinion that thought that women should not really be bothered or troubled with this, you see. So we forget that everything that we talk about in terms of equality, and this is not just gender, but the entire post-World War II landscape of human rights are important. We should not discriminate against each other. We have had enough of the Holocaust. All of this is very recent, and it flies in the face, I think, of centuries of human practice. And it's wise to remember that when you're talking about feminism. I have taken you down a whole different river this time."

        "message": "No, no. Such a learning experience listening to you. So before I get to my follow-up question, I am reminded of a song, because since you mentioned people in protest also sing and dance, you spoke about women in the 19th century waiting and hoping someone says yes. And there is this lovely poem by Laurence Alma Tadima called, If No One Ever Marries Me, which Natalie Merchant turned into this beautiful song, which I'll link from the show notes. Have you heard it? Yes. So I'll just read this out for the benefit of my listeners. If No One Ever Marries Me by Laurence Alma Tadima, and despite the name, this is written by a woman. If no one ever marries me, and I don't see why they should, for nurse says I'm not pretty and I'm seldom very good. If no one ever marries me, I shan't mind very much. I shall buy a squirrel in a cage and a little rabbit hutch. I shall have a cottage near a wood and a pony on my own, and a little lamb quite clean and tame that I can take to town. And when I'm getting really old, at 28 or nine, I shall buy a little orphan girl and bring her up as mine. And this also sort of reminded me of Hemabati Sen, you know, who I, you know, first read about in Kavitha Rao's excellent book on lady doctors. And again, another sort of remarkable woman beginning with, you know, she was married, I think, at the age of nine, to a husband who was 40 something, and he already had kids. And during the day, she would play with his children and at night, she'd be raped. And when she was 11, he died, and her in-laws died, and her parents died. So she's in this little village, I think it was in Silhet, she's in this little village in Bengal, far from everything, 11 years old, no relatives, no one to take care of her, no money. And she goes from there to actually get an education and become a lady doctor and phenomenal woman. And then she writes a book and she keeps all her writings in a trunk, which is not opened for 70 years, until 70 years after her death, and then it's published as her memoirs. So a fantastic story. And I want to ask you, therefore, about the long arc, right? One of the things that you mentioned is that in some ways, today, women have gone backwards, you know, and some of those we can see statistical indicators like women in the workforce, for example, and I've had many episodes on that with the likes of Namita Bhandari and Shrena Bhattacharya. And, but I've also spoken to people like Parmita Vohra, Kavita Krishnan, Manjima Bhattacharya recently, who had more optimism that in the longer arc, there was progress. And you know, you can't ignore that, that there might be moments where it seems that things are getting bad. But if you just have to take a step back, and not allow yourself to sort of get despondent, and you have to see that longer arc, what's your sense about that longer arc?"

        "message": "I believe in it. And that's a short answer, but I don't think there is room for despair. I think despair is energy sapping. But aside from that, I think despair is built on false perception. We are so in love with our own time, that we also like to think of our wars as extraordinary, you know, oh, my God, World War Three is on the horizon. Well, look at every century of human history, really, and I cannot remember a time that was free of wars. We also live through the extraordinary burst of hope that accompanied the falling of the Berlin Wall. You know, we have this movement from progress to regression to finally, let's hope that we keep moving forwards rather than backwards. But if you want hope, it's there all through history. Let's stay on gender for a second. But women like Andal, women like Mirabai, women like Laldeed, these were three women who in different centuries chose to live their own lives as free as possible and chose to define religion and faith in their own ways. I still remember Laldeed's vachas so beautifully translated by Ranjith Hoskote, you know, where she says, I have gone into the forest and wrestled with the lion. And there's this roar from her century, which was, she died in 1392, I think. And from her century to mine, her saying, I have fought for what I have. I have worked for the knowledge, you know, in the rest of the vachas, she says something, she says, what there was in the books I've taken and what there wasn't in the books, I have taught myself. And then she says, I've gone into the forest and wrestled with the lions. And basically, she's saying, I own this territory, I will be me, whether or not you allow me to be myself or not. So when I look at the history of just narrowing it down to either India or America, which is going through its own grievous, grievous moment of regression on many, many fronts, but definitely on gender rights and, you know, the whole Black Lives Matter movement being followed by the rise of white supremacy. Do you see an absence of grit? When you see Meena Kotwal at the Mooknayak, you know, one of my favorite media outlets, when you see the women of Khabar Lahariya, you know, moving by degrees towards finding themselves in possession of a camera, taking the story firmly from the hands of people who will interpret for them. To your grassroots readers, I see a vacuum at the political stage, but I don't think you know, a lot of token women up there, the Hindu right wing is brilliant at foregrounding women and giving them rules to play within that project. But I would venture to add rules to play without political agency of their own, you know, without asking themselves, is this really good for us? You can do what you want to, you can have a great deal of power. But if you dare to voice an opinion about women or about communal disharmony that is different from what your group says, you will mercilessly be cut out of your group. Given that, I don't see, I think we are going through a time of churn, a time of inevitable questioning. We will fall further backwards because we're trying to decide on something really big. Nations are so new, nations are so young, right? It's an idea that's been introduced and that will need to be defended not once, but over and over again. With so many countries, I see the same question arising, don't you? Which is, what is it that holds us together? What should hold us together? What makes us a whole? And the answers to that question are either going to be uniting, which is an extremely difficult project. If you think about it, it's a mental state of hand, you're saying all of us by dint of geography and shared history are together, but not those people across the border, you know, who share the same geography and at least part of the same history. Or you're doing the simple thing of dividing people by saying, we are the only ones who belong and the rest of them don't. And that's a very clean story. I see a lot of things in terms of narratives. And I see that in the churn that we're going through at this time, don't you see that some people are falling back in search of an older, maybe more regressive, but ultimately a safer narrative. There's a king, he's an evil king, or she is an evil queen, you know, they're tyrants. That's familiar. You see what I mean? If you're moving away from democracy back into an autocracy, and we've had so much written about autocracies and the pull of strongmen and all of that, at least that's familiar. One of my fellow columnists at the Financial Times, Janan Ganesh, wrote recently that the direction that he thinks that Europe might head in is not actually towards autocracies, but he thinks that they're heading towards a time of anarchy. And for many people, not knowing the uncertainty of we had an imperfect, messy democracy, we're trying to work out what the meaning of this democracy is in a time when you also have technological and oligarchic pressures. And we're trying to define ourselves in the middle of, you know, these enormous tectonic pressures. You'll choose certainty over uncertainty, most of humankind would. Change is frightening, right?"

        "message": "So a couple of thoughts, and then my follow up question. One thought is that what you asked about that common question that reverberates, that what can bring us together, how can we unite and all of that, I think what's happening in modern times is that there is a trend that goes in two different directions, and I don't know which will prevail. And one has to do with a crumbling away of the mainstream, but this time, in the context of nation states that I think more and more nation states with their hard boundaries that prevent people from reaching across and so forth, are becoming irrelevant. And the reason is technology, because technology is allowing us to one it's empowering individuals in a way that politics, you know, has failed to do in many different contexts. And it's helping people reach out and make geography irrelevant. And in that sense, what will unite us, I think there's a role that technology can play with the natural liberalism that it brings about. But the opposite is also true, which is that technology and we'll talk about social media afterwards. But how technology can always also divide us and polarize us and so on and so forth. And when you speak about people falling back and becoming more regressive, I think of the constant struggle of humankind, the ongoing struggle of humankind, as a struggle of human beings against our own programming, right? All animals, in a sense, have a source code inside them, they're programmed to be a certain way. And human beings are the only species, which are all which is also programmed to reflect on that programming, and to mitigate it and to fight against it, right. And we are, of course, programmed in contradictory ways as well, we are programmed to be tribal. But at a different level, we are also programmed to be altruistic. And we can reflect upon our programming. And therefore, we can mitigate it and fight it and let the better angels of our natures, as Steven Pinker eloquently puts it, emerge from there. And I think that that's sort of a constant battle. And it might seem that because of technological trends, and because of what's happening around us, the way the worst angels of the worst demons of our natures, as it were, it can sort of be amplified by our technology as well. And that's sort of the negative side of it. And we kind of come back to it. But these were my two musings. But my follow up question is this that in an episode I did recently with Shruti Kapila, she spoke about how she would be very keen on seeing whether the women of India can be united as voters. You know, you were talking about women in politics being mainly tokenistic and the natural question can arise as it has for Shruti that why don't women just see, just look at their own interests and then vote as one. But I also did an episode with Rukmini, the data journalist, and she pointed out that all her studies and all the data that she's looked at, showed that this is not the case. Women actually vote because of a multiplicity of factors, and thinking of themselves as women and fighting back against the inequities is not something that drives their voting at least. And one reason for that, of course, could be that all parties are equally misogynistic and all of that. So what do you do that society? But I think a deeper reason is that a lot of women also you will find rail against feminism, you know, which is so completely bizarre, that they're happy playing in the name of tradition at, you know, reinforcing the subsidiary roles that they play. And my question here is this, that you've referred earlier to how one of the things that you loved about our society, that you love about our society, and that I do as well, is that we are so open and so tolerant and all of that. I remember I had a conversation with the politician JP Narayan, and I was talking about how illiberal our society is. And of course, that, you know, you look at gender, you look at caste, you look at so many things, and we're deeply illiberal, and he pointed out that, if you without denying it, that if you look at it from another lens, we're deeply liberal, that there is, we are a very assimilative society, if you look at our food, our clothing, our culture, so much is really assimilative and tolerant and all of that. Now, what I've been struggling to grasp is that today we are in a place where our society is unquestionably divided, where there is bigotry and sexism, and all of that is widespread. And my sense and the great book by Akshay Mukul on the Gita Press, and I had an episode with him seems to bear it out. My sense is we were always like this. This is not something new. These aspects of our society have not been shaped by a hateful politics, but it is the other way around. Our hateful politics is supply springing up in response to demand, and that our society has also always been like this. So you know, how would looking back at the span of all these years where you've grown up and you worked and you've written and you've thought about this country and you've engaged with our politics in whatever way. What do you feel about this larger question that, you know, was our society always like this? And in a sense, you know, is it now that politics has caught up with society? And you know, what are your sort of thoughts?"

I think what grieves us most is our own selves, isn't that it? It's our neighbors turning this way, that way for whatever reasons. And I've never wanted to live anywhere outside the country. I'm speaking personally and perhaps very selfishly at this moment. I've never had a desire to have a life abroad, to visit abroad, to spend time there, yes. You know, the world is a big place and we're all citizens of the world as well. I don't think I've ever been as heartbroken by what is happening in this country as I am today. And as time goes by, as the political opposition fails and fails again, as our social fabric seems to crumble under the enormous pressure, let me say, put on it by a constant wave of tech enabled propaganda and hatred. We've seen, I've been tracking that hatred for a while and I've seen it move from being little bubbles on Facebook, which is bad enough and corrosive enough to being casual and mainstream and on your television sets and it is unreasonable not to expect human beings not to be changed by what they're consuming, okay. Ravish Kumar has said this, other people have said this, at this point we are consuming poison and make no mistake, that has changed us, it is going to change us if we harden our hearts. If we continue to think that it is alright to condone extreme violence, extreme dispossession of any one of us, the moment that you turn around as a country and you say, you can be killed, you know, we used to have this running joke among a certain percentage of us journalists about the abyss, I'd just about stopped writing op-eds at that stage and gone back to a job that allowed me to read books instead as it happened. But all of the op-eds about India, written in India and outside India, used to have that damn abyss around, right, that yes, we are on the edge of the abyss, we have descended into the abyss and at one point you are going to see that we are deep inside this morass and that what we are racing towards is clinically a place that no country, no nation, no people wants to go towards, you know, it's very hard to turn away from that violence. But because I read, I also remember reading accounts of first the horror, the helplessness that people felt when the inevitable violence of partition happened. And this was a country that had just been born where you barely had a government. The British had just left, you know, without leaving much in place to stem this violence. And after it stopped, the question on people's minds were, are we even a country? Is there anything that holds us together? I will say this, you know, it's not a question of set aside Modi this, Modi that, the Hindu Rashtra, you've had enough people who know deeply, who have studied the subject talk to you about this. But if your country does not hold together, then sooner or later you're just going to break into smaller and smaller pieces. Somebody will demand a homeland of their own, somebody will say, all right, now that we've finished saying that they don't belong, they don't belong either. And sometimes when I look at the map of India, it seems that it is smouldering, that there are fires everywhere. You have to get back to what holds you together. And it's been a long time since we focused on that. For a while after independence, I think what held us together was a combination of necessity and humanity. And all those, you know, slightly cheesy hum ek hai, anek hai, you know, unity and diversity ads and all of that. They were cheesy, but they had a function, there was functionality to it. And that was to remind us that simply we couldn't afford hate, we didn't have to love each other. A lot of this living side by side with each other, these agreements that we hammered out, even in America, even in England or Europe, it's only in the big cities that you have assimilation, integration, you know, all of these things, they cut against our deepest tribal instincts, right? And still, and still we abide. And still we fight back. And still we try to find a way to say that this shouldn't happen, and maybe we should be together. And still there is courage, an enormous amount of courage. So if you ask me where there's hope, the hope for me lies in the fact that many people haven't given up, that there is a quiet bravery, whether it's in protests, such as the farmers protest or the citizens protest. It's easy to mock people who are standing up and reading out the preamble. But if you've been there on a cold winter night in Delhi or out in Lucknow or somewhere, and you've heard the fervor and the faith in people's voices, you know that somewhere there's a contrary ripple that is reaching back to that time and saying, what if? What if we could imagine ourselves back into existence again? I don't think any country skips that, Amit. You know, that question of who we are and Europe is facing it in its own way, you know. If Europe lets go of nationhood, then what is it but a collection of warring empires without colonies, you see? What is America if it lets go of its original declarations? So again, here we are back at the imagination. You have to imagine yourself into a people. You have to imagine this whole project of unity, diversity, living together, secularism. It isn't as easy as just seeing it. One thing that forged people together after the freedom struggle was if you read Manohar Malgankar and if you read Mulk Raj Adan and other writers from that period, Kamla Das, etc., Kanthapura, Raja Rao's great book, you see that it wasn't this cartoon story of the whole country coming together to fight the British. Among the Indians, there were many who rested their faith in the princely states that were taken apart after independence. There were many who were also perfectly happy to let the British be the emperors of this age. Take care what is wrong. We are Rai Bahadurs. We are benefiting from the system. They're not so bad, etc. You have to imagine independence for yourself and any country that can do that has a shot at imagining its way back to safety from where we are heading. The only thing is that once you have a certain kind of conflict or breakout, once you open the doors to all the things that we are fearing, whether it's some people fear civil war, some people fear another genocide, some people just fear a time of vast persecution, endless persecution that's normalized and where all you have to ask of the other people in this project is to look away. You know, you assure them immunity and you say look away and that's all that is required."

        "message": "So you know, I'll make a brief anti-national aside and then ask the follow-up question to the follow-up question, going further and further down tributaries and branching to God knows where. And the aside is that what you mentioned about the country breaking up and all of that. Sometimes I wonder if it would have been better if we weren't one united country, but if we were many countries, like I did an episode on the great VP Menon with Narayani Basu. And one of the sort of things I realized while reading up on Menon and Sardar Patel and what they did was that what Patel and Menon did in bringing this great country politically together, you know, between the years 47 to 50, was like an act of fast track colonization. What the British did over centuries, these guys did in a few months, a lot of it through violence and coercion. And of course, I believe the end doesn't justify the means. And a lot of it through promises that were later broken. And it seems to be in many ways a profoundly immoral act. But leave that aside. It is what it is. And both of us love this country for what it is and so on and so forth. But that's just a thought I sometimes have that maybe if we were many different countries or different nations, governance would be much better because the point is, governance gets better, the more local it is. And we have too much of a sort of a centralized system and that kind of works against it. You know, why not just have a whole bunch of states competing with each other to govern better and to attract people and to attract capital and so on and so forth. Because we have nowhere near the federalized kind of system that we should though I having articulated this aside, you know, when you mentioned partition, you mentioned the inevitable violence of partition and that word inevitable strikes me and I think it's an apt term. And I think it's I would apply it to where we are today and say that this was inevitable because my sense is that one, our society was always like this, but why is it so bad today? Why is it amplified so much? And I turn to this concept I picked up from Timur Kuran's 1999 book, Public Lies, Private Truths, where he came up with the concept of preference falsification. And he gave the example of the Soviet Union. Till the last years of the Soviet Union, nobody in that place spoke against the state because they thought they were the only ones who felt that way, who felt that anger. And therefore, you know, they hid their preference. That was preference falsification. And the example Kuran gave us, look, at one point there was something called a preference cascade where people realized that, hey, they're not the only ones. Everybody feels like them. And then eventually, it seems like it happened almost overnight. But people didn't change their minds overnight. They could just express themselves. And I think in a negative sense, a similar thing happened with social media, where I think people within our society were fundamentally bigoted and sexist and casteist and all of that. But it wasn't it was not something you could express in polite company. You felt guilty about it. It was something you held within you. And with social media, you suddenly realized that, damn it, everybody feels like me. And then you become emboldened to express yourself openly. And you don't need like politicians stop dog whistling because they can just say things directly. They don't need to dog whistle anymore. So, so the hatred that we see around us has found expression in modern times because of technology and social media, but has not been created in modern times. It was always there simmering beneath the surface. And it was bound to come out at some point. And the other thing that you sort of mentioned where you speak about imagining in India the necessary to imagine in India, you know, I think it was a grand task done by well-meaning men with the best of intentions. But I also think that it failed because that imagination, when it happened was done by a group of elites and the India they were imagining was not the India there was. And in trying to force fit the India of their imagination into the real India, they failed because it tried to go top down and not bottom up like one, you know, trope that I keep revisiting on my shows is how, if you look at our constitution, it was essentially a liberal constitution, nowhere near as liberal as I would like, but relatively, it was essentially a liberal constitution imposed on an illiberal society. And one you can also meta question about whether such an imposition can be liberal itself. But therefore, it was bound to fail that Gandhi was right where he said that you have to change society from within, top down interventions will fail. And I think we see, you know, the folly of that act of imagination today. And I would say that if elites today try to imagine a new India into being, it is bound to fail in the same way. And I don't think it's a bad thing that elites and all those kind of elites are no longer in power, because they were foolish and they failed. And we didn't get anywhere with that. What we need to do is make society more liberal, if that is possible. And I believe it is possible, but I believe it's very difficult and we are not really moving towards that so far. So just a bunch of sort of thoughts on, you know, what we were speaking about. So do you have something you'd like to respond to?"

        "message": "I was thinking about the inevitability of some things, you know, as this peculiar thing called a nation when you don't even speak the same language. We say we have a common history, but parts of the South, parts of the Northeast, parts of the West have very, very distinct and individual histories. I don't really agree with the fragmentation theory. I think in practice, you'll find that it's a much less utopian and more messy thing. You know, Balkan violence is what you're sort of mean. Exactly. Quite aside from being anti-national. But let me get back to a few things, I don't think that this country was imagined into being entirely by a handful of elites. One of the things that one of our major national parties has forgotten, actually, is how broad its origins were as a big tent and how diverse the group of people and politicians who gravitated to the Congress in that time were. I don't think that we should idolize anything, whether that is the party presently in charge or the Congress of Gandhi's time, you know, to see things through the lens of adulation and how fantastic they were. What the Congress really was, was a mass movement. And I'm stressing that mass to say that I think where Gandhi and the other leaders extraordinary achievement was, was to carry a huge proportion of the body politic along with them, to rouse them to a fever of longing for this ideal country. Set us against that and we're not going to discuss ideas of India because, you know, that's such an old and trash debate. But there is the dream of the Begumpura, you know, the ideal place where without caste, without communal differences, without religions, there's also apparent and longing for that. Now let's bring technology in. Curiously enough, one of the areas where I'm optimistic about is after seeing the damage done across the globe by big tech and by the weaponization of tech as a tool to spread very successfully narratives, feelings, attitudes, beliefs of hatred. One of these questions that we keep asking ourselves, oh, were we always like this, were we always hateful? And I think of that old, you know, it well, you know, that Buddhist meditation story about the two wolves. You know, you have two wolves, one destructive, one enormously creative, one benevolent, one hostile. There's four wolves, I get what you're saying. But you know, benevolent, creative one side and hostile and destructive on the other."

        "message": "Of course, I wanted a wolf, who doesn't? I don't want a wolf, but I find this very strange. Anyway, so to get back to these two wolves, it's it's a simple question. It's the one you feed. And we pay too much emphasis on are we like this, are we like that, do we have this in our national character? Yeah, where are people's attention being directed? What are they consuming? And our belief, you know, in the fullness of a personality in independent of this is touching but deeply misplaced. Every one of us, in addition to having that unbreakable seed of a self inside, is also basically a component of a mixture of everything that we have consumed, everything that we're taking in, and most seriously, where we are directing our attention to. So you know, as dismayed as I've been by the consequences of this technologically driven and enabled hate, a simple example, you know, you've seen what Twitter is these days. Imagine a Twitter where for just one day, it is not possible to abuse Kashmiris, Muslims, Bengalis, liberals, seculars, for one day, it's not there. And you can see it and those are our pet hates, other people have different pet hates. But for that one day, discourse would be that much freer, people's blood pressure would not be that high, their sense of being under threat and being attacked would be much, much lower. In effect, if you could cut that out, you would change the stream itself, you would change where people were looking. If your attention has been directed to hate, it's not just because people love hating or because we have this ancient enemy or whatever, it's simply because hatred in the short run is politically extremely lucrative, right? Run a riot or mini riot or a set of, you know, demolitions or destructions of people's homes, and you will win an election. It's as simple as that. If there wasn't a coordination between the two people would not do it. If for 8-10 years, the people who have been most concerned with spreading propaganda, most diligent about it, most engaged in this project, and who have also mastered the tools that were available to everybody, right from the start of this decade onwards, then don't blame technology per se for being a purveyor of hate. What it shows you silently is that if you take the other projects as seriously, and let me just say this on mic so that we have this, spread love. What's your first reaction? Your first reaction is, what the hell yaar, cynicism, laughter, you know, sirf pyaar batao. What kind of ussi message is that? That's what we think of love, right? We don't think of love or loving each other or being compassionate or living together as good things. We think of them as prissy things. How do you change that messaging? People are smart here. If you really want to change it, you can. But that has to be not just a political project, it has to be a social project. Is it possible? Yes, because in microcosms, it did help us live by each other's sides uneasily, imperfectly, but still try, you know. Cities like Delhi and Bombay and Calcutta have, honestly, Calcutta has a reputation for being eclectic, but the same multivisions do operate. There's a South Calcutta and a North Calcutta, there's a South Bombay and there's the rest of Bombay as well. I think we are imperfect in these projects, but I think we've done enough of the movement of people from villages to the city. The places that taught me in Delhi that we could live side-by-side, I don't want to romanticize this, but unfortunately, this is actually a truth. It was not the new slums, it was not the old grand residential colonies, which fall very easily back, you know, the RWAs and the gated colonies. Unconsciously, they will fall back into the habits of segregation and they will keep people out. You can see that the map of South Delhi itself is changing to be far more, you know, majoritarian than it used to be and far less assimilative. But it was the in-between places. It was the Lajpat Nagar places which are grudgingly, but for money, you know, open to refugees from all across South Asia. And it was some of the slum clusters, by and large, not the new ones, because the new ones almost always divide in terms of you've come from here, you hang out with people from where you've come from. The moment that they get a little older and a little more layered, people have to learn to live together. And you know, even if their version of living together is two communities sitting with an edge and a border between them, one thing that I'm hearing in this time of hatred, effective hatred, is we used to celebrate, but now we don't. Our roads used to go past each other's house, but now we don't. You can despair, or you can stop and think, wait a second, for all these years we used to live together, where did we learn that? Why aren't we paying more attention to that? I think it's possible. I just think that it is such a gigantic project and it requires such a shift internally, you know, to our minds. One of the reasons why I say that we can't afford despair is not because, okay, we're part of this great battle that we're going to win. But if you, anywhere in the world, including our country, if you are despairing because the right wing is rising, well, you know, one thing we could learn from the right is that they've sat there without power, in clusters that have been very divided, without much in the way of resources, for well over 30, 40 years. It's been, I forget how many years, but at least decades since Alice Munro wrote an incredible short story about, you know, the battles that they were having over Darwin, okay. Many many years later, you have book bands in America taking hold. It's taken that much time to get to the place where you have power and you have agency as a member of the rising right, or if your hate politics become effective. It takes 40 years of engineering, 50 years of engineering. So I ask you, is this the time to give up, or is this the time to actually start thinking about these things seriously? If you're going to preach love, then can you find a way to do it that makes people not switch off the televisions immediately? If you're going to find a practical reason for why love should triumph, make that argument. In literature, in poetry, but most of all in politics. So I'll come up with an observation. Frankly, I don't think we can afford despair."

        "message": "So I'll come up with an observation that is bookended by the thought of spreading love. And first of all, thank you for, you know, you brought a smile to my face by mentioning Alice Munro, a writer I love so much, my favorite living writer by far. And I'll in fact link my favorite short stories by her in the show notes, because why not everyone should read them? She's amazing. Spreading love. The interesting thing is that I don't want to paint social media or Twitter as all bad because you know, one of the things I've realized is that there's a lot of joy to be had from Twitter if you curate your feed properly. That what you really have also on Twitter is you are all the time exposed to the best minds in the world thinking aloud for your benefit, which is pretty remarkable enough. You know, and there's a small group of people, for example, who'll share poetry, you'll write about books and so on and so forth. And I would call that spreading love. But that's not so dominant. And that's really, that's in a sense, silent. The trend that I see what social media does is that the way it polarizes us really is that we go on social media, everybody wants to have a sense of community and tribe and all of that. So people will typically join ideological tribes at the extremes of the left and the right. And then they want to the incentives are obviously to raise the status within that tribe. And the way to do it is by attacking people on the other side, never addressing arguments, but just attacking and snarking, and so on, and then attacking people on their own side for not being pure enough. And that tendency to swing towards the extremes, because that's the only way you can rise in status is something that you see in the real world. And in our politics as well, like, you know, there was a time where a political scientist uses term called the median voter theorem, where the idea was that if you just take the US as a simple example for a moment, because there are two large parties, and that's it, you know, the two parties may swing in whatever directions during the primaries, but in the main election, they would always sort of swing towards the center. It's all like the metaphor drawn for this is of ice cream vendors at a beach, let's say there's one ice cream vendor at a beach, he can be anywhere along it. But if there are two, the incentive is to be as close to the center as possible, those two vendors may start out at the edges, but then the closer they get, the more optimal it is for them in terms of people walking by. And eventually, you'll have them right next to each other, neighboring ice cream vendors in the center of this pathway. So what you would typically have expected in the 2016 presidential elections in the US, for example, would be Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush, because they were from different parties, but they were pretty much identical in their politics, the differences are just surface. But they were really similar, really mainstream, beholden to the similar set of interest groups, big money interest groups, and so on and so forth. Where it fell apart was in Trump, because he was just not part of the picture at all. And politics swung to the extremes and just as the right swung to the extremes. And I don't even know if it's fair to call them the right because Trump took the party in Republican Party in directions which had nothing to do with the values of the Republican Party at all. Right? He was like a black swan, like his economics is just the opposite of Republican economics in his opposition to trade, for example, very so much like Bernie Sanders. But the point being that they swung to the extremes, and they're still swinging to the extremes today, because that is how today you rise within a party. And an example of that would be that Dharam Sansad at the end of the last year, when you had this whole bunch of saints or godmen or whatever all in quote marks, giving these incredibly incendiary speeches calling for genocide and so on. And my sense there is that that's this drive towards extremism playing out. Because if you look at the incentives of the leaders there, you know, it's it's a competition who can rouse the crowds more who can stand out more and the only way to do that is not by preaching love, but by swinging towards the extreme. So I think if it was one guy giving a speech alone, it would not have been so toxic. But because you have all these people competing with each other, there are no limits, all bets are off. And as you know, the political theorist Carl Schmitt famously said, perhaps a century ago that politics is all about the other you need an other in politics, you know, spreading love does not win you votes, spreading hate does. So that's sort of just how it is. So I want to talk about this, therefore, also, in the context of like, if we dive back to feminism for a moment, right, both Kavita Krishnan and Manjuma Bhattacharya recently spoke about how we have to see that there is a difference between feminism on the ground, people who are actually out there in the real world doing things making women's lives better off, as opposed to a lot of the toxic posturing that you see on social media for from armchair warriors. And this is my articulation, none of them use these words, I'm saying this. And that's something that interests me. Because what I find in a lot of the woke politics, for example, is a sense of identity as something immutable. And you get a mirror image of this in the right. And I feel that that's incredibly disturbing. Because as you know, I'm, for me, the ultimate value is in individual rights and consent and autonomy. You know, no one should be pinned down to an identity of birth and one that they did not choose. And speaking of identities can be useful as a tool of analysis. But when you use it to pass judgment on people and to shut people out of the discourse, and so on and so forth, I think that can kind of get very toxic. And when it comes to sort of that whole notion of spreading love, like I was reading bell hooks recently, and was struck by how much she talks about compassion, including compassion for men, including compassion for her father, and so on. It's a very nuanced kind of view, where you're seeing everyone as victims, where you're trying to understand where they come from. But there is a certain strain, not just of feminism, but any ism that you express online, which has no space for this nuance, which must push for the extremes, which must pass judgment on the world, which must condemn and so on and so forth. So being someone who's used Twitter from its early days, being someone who's had the lived experience of engaging with feminism over these decades of, you know, even if you haven't at, for some of this time, as you put it, you haven't been an activist, you've been a participant or whatever, what is your sense of what's kind of happening here? Because while I certainly call myself a feminist, and, and I can't understand how anyone would not be one male or female, you know, I speak with older feminists who find, who find some of this, what is happening on social media, sort of disquieting, to the extent that Manjumma in fact said that these days, these days, I don't even call myself a feminist, because, you know, even though she studied it and written on it, and so on and so forth. So what's sort of your response to this?"

        "message": "Lierd, to begin with, I'm not comfortable with the term woke politics, though I understand what you mean. I think that's too broad an umbrella to encompass the many movements that have also flourished on social media, not just social justice warriors or whatever, but movements where your social media presence is an accurate mirror of your life and work offline, you know, we're back at something that you talked about earlier, which was authenticity. And I think what you are picking up on is inauthentic politics and the power of that inauthentic politics. Trump, whom you started off by mentioning, changed everything with a simple shift. It didn't matter what he was saying, and it did sometimes, it's just that people could not take their eyes off him. A few voices early on said starve him of oxygen, but people were unable to look away. With the Dharamsad and Sads that you mentioned, they're escalating, but there's no percentage to being, I think there the problem is slightly different as with Trump. It's that what you're seeing online can be amplified and used to create real danger, real violence offline, right? So your impact is far higher than your presence on social media. But social media is a world of shadows. It's not a world of substance. Increasingly I find that I am disengaging. This is again a very personal response. I stay on Twitter partly because there's the addictive hook of it. And you know, my two addictions are basically caffeine and Twitter at this point. And in part too, I tell myself weekly, it's to stay informed, but I find myself following the feeds that are not thoughtless positivity, which is a genre that just gets up my nose. You know, that whole, no, no, think good thoughts, be bright and happy. The good morning WhatsApp forward philosophy of life, I cannot be having time or space for that because often that's a plea to you to disengage completely. That's a plea to you to look away from the truth of what is happening here and elsewhere. Having said that, I find myself drawn to feeds that are thoughtful, immersed, but not directly about the topic of the day, the trending political person of the day, the controversy of the day. Right. And those feeds are run by people like Paul Holdengraber, by Maria Popova, by Rana Safi as well by Rabi Alamuddin. They feeds that give you a sense of what the whole spread love thing can be. It's so easy to mock that, by the way, I'm, I'm aware that I've opened myself up to mockery. But let me put it this way, if somebody is shouting a toxic, I don't even want to say it on, even though it's said so often, hateful nationalist slogan into the air, demonizing part of our citizenry. What prevents us from saying, saare jahan ke achcha, mazav nahi sikha tha, aapas mein bair rakhna. I think what prevents us is a lack of belief in that. And people sense insincerity, one of the reasons why haters on social media are powerful is because people sense that the hatred is authentic, it is coming from a true place, right. And that's very seductive. Instead of the hard work of that not woke politics, but that a certain kind of politics demands. If you're a feminist, I think it's very uncomfortable, believing in something deeply, whether it's feminism, or free speech, or equality for all, because or a better environment, whatever it is, that politics will start to change you, right. And you will start to question your choices. And sometimes you will be extremely uncomfortable with your own actions. And that's the way it should be, you know, a good politics, a healthy politics should change us. Why do I have the freedom movement so much at my forefront, I think, again, because of direct political situations were to thought experiment, I've sometimes wondered about what would they have been like on social media, you know, I can't imagine that, but I can imagine that I can imagine that in the volume of the persuasion, the efforts at persuasion that were made, not just by our own independence movement, but by practically any movement that I can think of, whether it's feminism, Indian or otherwise, has put a great deal of time and attention into what we would call advocacy, but what I would call the art of persuading people to sit down and listen to you. So if we can't articulate love, just leave that thought to one side, as we continue with this identity, I hate to say it, if you're a Kashmiri Muslim, at this point, you don't have the luxury of walking away from your identity, as much as you might plead for your individual self to be recognized, if you're a Palestinian, if you're somebody who is currently experiencing tremendous oppression, because of your identity, you don't have the freedom."

Now, what I mean about the toxicity of identity politics is someone then pointing a finger at you and saying, oh, she's a privileged Savannah woman, she has no right to talk about caste. And I have a problem with that. I think we all have a right to talk about whatever we want to talk about and whatever concerns us. You know, if I am, for example, concerned that the anti Muslim hatred that is spreading through our country today, I have a right to speak about that as well. I love my country. I don't want to, you know, so it's sort of this kind of thing where a label is put on you and then you are told you can do this or you can't do this, that this is not for you to speak about, that you are Savannah or you are white and shut the F up. And what you really see in a lot of the extreme discourse in the US is that whiteness is being conflated with white supremacy, almost. It feels like that in a lot of the discourse. And to me, going to that extreme just becomes a problem. So that's the sense I mean it in. Of course, if you're Muslim today in India, you can't escape your identity. Of course, if you're a woman in India, you can't escape that you're a second class citizen. You know, at the level of analysis, of course, I mean, I'm totally with you. But when your identity is used against you, then that is the thing I have an issue with, you know, so that that's sort of if you get where I'm coming from."

She's a teacher with highly awarded memoir about teaching in London's inner city schools and teaching children who are often refugees, often from very poor, underprivileged backgrounds. And she was taken to task two years after her novel was awarded by three writers of color who pointed out that some of her descriptions of these children were borderline racist or fully racist or very, very reductive at the least, you know, they seem to lack compassion or they put these children into particular boxes. In an ideal world, there would have been room for both sides to talk to each other, for Clanchy to maybe listen and say, okay, let me have a chat with my publisher, right? And let me see what I can do. These are the changes I'm on board with. These are the things I don't feel I should change. From both sides, this turned into a thing where the women who included, you know, writers like Monisha Rajesh and Jimine Suniman and others, were subjected to barracking and abuse. Kate Clanchy was demonized on the other side. It ended up being, it's still running through cycles, you know, with people alternately seeing Clanchy as a monster or as a savior figure or monstering the women who called her out or, you know, elevating them to a level that they may not have chosen for themselves. And it's become profoundly unproductive, okay. It hasn't pushed the central issue further. In fact, the central issue has been lost in this. Why am I picking this as an example instead of the many other, you know, juicy controversies we could pile on to? Because I think we are all seeing a problem when discussion is shut down or brought to a halt or goes into extremely thin territory, extremely unproductive, unprofitable, very arid territory, non-creative territory, okay. I don't have a problem with shutting up if somebody says, you as a Savarna privileged woman have had the mic for too long. Can you make space for someone else? That's fair. That's absolutely fair.

My question is often whether it's a book or whether it's something else, it's focused on outcome. In literature, a lot of this debate is framed as who do you have the right to write about? And instinctively, I think I can see both sides. I can see the argument for saying, write with some sensitivity. But if you take the whole don't write people whom you don't know, think to its extreme, we're all going to be writing monologues that take place in our own heads. And that are only about ourselves."

You can't paint that. You can't think this, you know. I would not stand for it personally on the left or the liberal side of the world either. But that's just me. I don't want to make the rules for the whole world. So what we're coming towards is, do you really want to set down rules about these things? Yeah. When you're speaking about compassion, you can't enforce compassion on somebody who has been deprived of an opportunity to speak all their lives. And maybe sometimes, you know, just stand up and take your hurt feelings and it's okay. You still have a way to speak. You are still going to continue to speak. That's fine. I think what you're noticing though is emblematic of a larger problem and that is that this entire set of politics, whatever you want to call them, cancel culture is a term that the right uses. But this narrowing of argument down to the rituals surrounding a set of things in the hope that this will somehow, you know, provide a greater piece of justice. The rituals cannot replace the actual action for justice. And I think that just because people are liberals or on the left, that does not make them less prone to being vengeful. In the early days of Twitter, I look at the times when, you know, I've given into the temptation to be morally superior or to tell somebody off and here's the truth. It feels great in the moment. Afterwards, if you're at all reflective, a day later, you're thinking about that and you feel very small telling somebody how they should live their lives or what they should think or whatever. Getting down, taking the slightly confused set of arguments back to strictly the literary, artistic, creative world and off Twitter for a second, I think it is problematic to say literature should be free, everybody should have the right to write, everybody else. That just opens a door for somebody to write very hatefully and with a lack of respect or lack of understanding, which is worse, you know, about specific groups of people. But the more we get into rules and the more we get into policing, the more we start to resemble the forces that we hate and we have to watch out for that. You have to be careful. The second thing is that this strain, Ed Luce, who I keep quoting Financial Times columnist today and I'm sorry, it's just that I read a string of particular people."

But he says that part of America's problem is that the left's concerns and liberal concerns and democratic concerns cannot be so narrow that they lose, you know, sight of what a wider politics is. So in all this discussion about, you know, who gets to speak where or Twitter policing or whatever it is, aren't we losing sight of the much, much broader battles ahead in terms of justice and equality and all of that? Aren't these, at the end of the day, aren't a lot of these very esoteric and very narrow pursuits? I don't mean that they are unimportant. I just mean, I don't mean to trivialize them either. But sometimes I just think that these things that you care so passionately about on Instagram or Twitter or whatever, can be very in-group concerns. And if you're focusing on that, if you're focusing on, you know, the etiquette of how to respond to X, Y or Z or join in this particular cultural boycott or another, is what you're doing enabling the bigger picture or are you getting lost in a very small debate? Something that I think we're both frustrated with, because again, we've discussed this as friends elsewhere, is the tendency of a certain kind of liberal line of argument to go into, you know, opposing hate, but saying, oh, but we did it also back in the day, collapsing in a heap, you know, saying that we don't have any moral ground and getting into a tangle of relatively minor points, you're leaving the main issue on the table unaddressed in this paroxysm of shame and guilt and, you know, all of that. So somewhere I think what we're looking for is, as much as the right is also lost across the world, you remember a time when being conservative or being right wing did not have to mean that you were associated with hate politics. So as powerful as the surge of hate is, I would argue very strongly that the right has lost its compass completely, you know, I know that's a very broad based argument. But I would argue that very strongly for India, America and parts of Europe, for sure. If you're defining yourself as a right wing party in France, with your anti-immigration policy and losing sight of everything else that is supposed to go into being part of the traditional right, then you no longer know who you are. If your identity as a right wing in America is built on, we will hate these minorities and cut off the rights of women, then you've lost contact with your own heritage, right? And India, I mean, the same goes, one thing I used to like a little bit, not about Nehruvian politics, but about the general strain of mainstream politics out here is that there were so many contradictory opinions coming at each other. And in just the same way, I don't want to say this as a sweeping indictment, but I think liberalism per se is struggling to hold on to the thread of the story, isn't it? If we get sidetracked by relatively minor, relatively petty issues, I think the one area where I'm in complete rather than occasionally partial agreement with you is on the whole thing of if we're so busy cancelling each other, you know, Gandhi had particular flaws, this person cannot speak, this person by the standards of our time is bad. You need to watch out with that, you know, the politics of purity are dangerous on either side of the fence. There is no such thing as pure territory. We live in not just in an imperfect time, but we have to find a way to live with the imperfection of ourselves. We need fewer heroes. We need fewer perfect people, but we do need to be able to make arguments with passion and belief and to hold space for each other."

And just as the right as you put it have lost their compass, I think so as a left, I mean, my issue with the bigotry on both sides is that I am the bigotry on the right doesn't worry me so much because I wear it on their sleeve. It is what it is. But the bigotry on the left is dressed up in this sanctimony, which, you know, is much harder to counter. And thankfully, what you know, we've both been referring to and all the posturing and all the noise and the extremes is a vocal minority, sorry, most people aren't like that most people, the sense that I get are a silent majority, and perhaps the chilling effect makes them more silent than ever, because anything they say can be can get them cancelled or can get an online mob on them.

Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it, only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free.

The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com Thank you. Welcome back again to the scene in the unseen because this was our umpteenth break and I'm chatting with my good friend Ilanjana Roy on on her life and her thoughts. And there's really so much to explore that we could go on for another five hours, but we won't go on for that long. One of the things that struck me when I read The Girl Who Ate Books, and I was sort of reading your backstory as it were, is how much you remember of your ancestors, right? So you've got besides your parents, you've got grandparents from every side, you've got grand uncles, you've got older ancestors who are taking loans from Armenians and doing this and doing that. And there's just so much action all over. And there is also a richness of things in the sense, you know, I did this one paragraph which you may not, you know, consider a big deal, but I remember it, where you write quote, My Thakur Ma, Bibobati Devi, Baba's mother was a writer in an unfussy way, producing short stories in Bengali with the same practice flick of her wrist that she used to turn out roasted coconut treats and puffed rice and jaggery moas. She kept her writings in a black leaded tin trunk, her homemade sweets in an old lactogen tin, both containers equally battered and utilitarian. And stop quote. And that lactogen tin really speaks to me. You know, when I was in Chandigarh recently, we sold my father's house, I was clearing out the stuff, we chose to give most of it away or get rid of it, gave thousands of books to a local community library in Delhi, I just kept a few as artifacts in a sense, because most of my reading is sort of on Kindle and so on. And it was difficult in the sense that I know that none of what I was choosing to part with had any practical value at all. And yet it is a texture of my growing up and my childhood and all that. And that made me think about whether it is a blessing or a curse to have a past that has some kind of richness in it. And my past does not have too much richness in it, it's just the parents. And then I have no sentiments, very few memories, it's not there. But even this, to sort of say that, okay, this part of my life is gone forever, and we'll live only in memory. And that was kind of tough. And at one point, you cherish what you had, and you lament the loss. But at another point, it also frees you from not having the burden of that past from being just able to move forward and realize that most of it in terms of the physical things that it was embodied in, most of those things are not essential to you at all, you want to live an essential life. Like one of the things that my wife and I were talking about as we went through this exercise is how we have too many things as well, which burden us down and hold us back. And you want to sort of move to a more minimal kind of life, you don't have so many things because things are not important. And of course, technology has given us the luxury and the privilege to be able to do that because we can keep all our 1000s of books in digital copies. And we can keep all our work in a digital form uploaded to the crowd. We don't, you know, physical things aren't a big deal anymore. If my laptop starts working, I'll get another one and that will have exactly the same things on it as this one does. But given that your sense of the past is so rich, given that your memories contain all of these things, how do you view that coming to where you are? Because and also in a related sense, you know, when you think of home, what is your sense of home? Like I had a recent episode with Max Rodenbeck, where I asked him this question, and he grew up in Cairo. And he said, it's Cairo, but it's not the Cairo that is there today. It's a Cairo of memory, and therefore a Cairo of imagination, because memory and imagination are so closely linked together. So what is your sense of this rich past you've written about it so much? You live in it still, obviously, because one must keep going back to that. But you know, I don't even know if there's a question, but I just sort of wanted your impressions and your thoughts of this."

        "message": "Actually, I'm surprised because with The Girl Who Ate Books, I think that's the only one of my books where I've gone even somewhat autobiographical. And because so much of that book is about my encounters, you know, it's the business standard interviews that I did with so many writers. There are standalone essays that are about the history of Indian writing in English and that are very abstract. Some of them are about early pioneers in writing, and some of them are about the growth of history. I don't think I'd realized that I had written as much about my family as I did. I'm going back to why I did that, and I don't think it was to boast or to show off. I think I was looking really for the literary heritage. My grandmother's trunk, one of the saddest scars on my heart is that she lifelong was a published author. She used to write poems and short stories that at that time I didn't read. And some of them were published in little magazines in Bengali and all of that. And after she died, her trunk went to a member of the family who is now also passed on. And I was very, I didn't want to ask just after her death for the stories back and all of that, but after about nine months, 10 months, I said, do you think I could take copies of all her writings? And she said, oh, yes, of course you can. Where are they? And I said, they were in the black trunk. She said, oh, that trunk, it was filled with rubbish papers and they were moth eaten and I just threw them away. There was nothing of value in there. And I don't think she meant any harm, but it meant something to me. I've always felt that phantom side of not just my grandmother's personal writings disappearing, but it touched on a deep, deep wound, which was the lack of women's histories. Often when you look at collections of writers, except up to the modern day, where it's changed a little bit, the archives are usually kept men of letters, their notes, their letters, etc. are all kept and maintained. And it's that much harder to put together the biography of India's women writers. And suddenly, you know, my tiny personal loss was moving into this much wider absence, to some extent. With the rest of my family, I think I was writing about them to try and fix something in my mind, that old question of where do you come from? What stream? Some of it was gratitude, some of it was saying, you know, thank you to all of you who gave me books and reading or allowed me to pester you for stories. My uncle, you know, used to just sit there patiently, he was an architect. And he used to sit there patiently with one or the other of us attached to his leg like little limpets, telling a story after story. My mother, my father was so generous with his books. And I feel that because so many people don't have that in their lives, it's more important for us. I don't mean to be sonorous, but I did feel the need to acknowledge that. In terms of where is home, that used to be a little bit of a heartache because my husband and I have never bought a home. And we both come from the quintessential Calcutta families where own homes are either mired in legal trouble or have long since crumbled. Home for me was maybe not so much the homes where I grew up in government circles, or there was a period when my father was posted to Calcutta, and we shifted home houses in Delhi 13 times in the course of just a few years, which was salutary, you know, it took me out of the cozy and very, very insulated cocoon of government life where by and large, more than actual comfort, what you have is an absence of discomfort."

But when I went to Calcutta, I spent about four years or so studying at La Martiniere, which was as open a school as I've said, as my former convent was a little on the closed side. And the house that my grandmother had is again part of the vanished heritage of the city. It was a wonderful old red brick house, you know, built with one room sprawling into each other. It was a fusion of styles, Indian and Bengali meeting British with a huge veranda that opened out onto a lawn and turrets and things and books lining every room, every room, you know. It was also a warm and hospitable and convivial house and that was my strongest sense of home. And it was broken down more than 30 years ago. And it's instructive to see how that absence has become for some family members, a real ache, you know, when a home is taken away and our home just went in the normal course of things. It wasn't bulldozed by a cruel administration. But for some people it's become a permanent ache, an absence not just of a physical home, but without that you can get unmoored. You can literally not know how to see where you come from, you know, or what you belong to or what grew you up or shaped you. In terms of shaping me as a person, I think my other home was always, it sounds so trite to say this, but it is so true, Amit, it was in books. You know, that was because that was the one constant in parts of my life, both as a child and an adult where I was switching houses a lot. You can make your home in the books that you read. And so there was never a point where I felt truly unhoused. And I just want to add that, you know, most of my movings around have not been particularly traumatic. It's not been like a partition or the refugee coming out or whatever. But you still feel that absence of a center. Okay. Over time, the need for things has shifted. I am a sentimentalist and one of my great pleasures is not having, you've seen the house, it's not particularly, you know, show offy, you know, I don't think it's done to any style. It's basically a friendly conglomeration of cats and very old furniture and books all mingling together. And I don't think we've ever sat down and said, should we design this better? You know, even though I love walking into well-designed homes myself, but I've just never got around to doing that for myself. The things that are precious to me are things like books that are signed, a poem from Shahid, a letter from Krishna Subti, you know, those things, a painting by a friend, a photograph by a friend, those are treasures, you know, an autograph from Toni Morrison or Harold Pinto, Amitav Ghosh or Salman Rushdie, those are things I will treasure for life because there's something about handwriting that really, really speaks to me. In terms of other possessions, every so often I give away a huge bunch of books to a local library and I feel that much freer, you know. With furniture, it's a blessing and a curse when it's family furniture. In a way, you become the keeper of a family heritage whether you want to or not, and it's very difficult to let go of that. If for no other reason than other people in the family would mind if they came to your house and found those things not there, which is such an odd thing, but anyway. And it can be reassuring as well, it can be a little part of the past. But increasingly, I find that my pleasure in owning things insofar as that was ever a part of my life, that has disappeared, you know. The things that have given me the greatest sense of challenge or curiosity in my life have been conversations and encounters with people and in that I've been richer than most. You know, that is really that and also something I just take for granted but that a lot of other writers struggle with. Because a long time ago, I chose not to have a formal job. I work as a condominist, I do other things as well, but I don't have to check in to an office and I've always had huge amounts of control over my time. And we've been talking about privilege in so many different ways through this conversation. One of the greatest privileges you can have in this or any other country as a woman is to have that control over your time. And of course, you know, there's family duties even if you don't have children, but those are compared to most women's lives where you don't have the freedom to think about where you want to spend your time. That is huge. Let's just get back to this whole thing of possessions and how they define you. I think for a lot of people, the first time that they move into a home of their own without their family stuff is maybe the first time that they see themselves with some clarity. And I remember a friend of mine who was also a writer coming to my study for the first time and seeing in tremendous disappointment, oh, but you know, you don't have a view. You look out over the backyard and a mango tree and I always thought that you would have a room with a view and a fancy study. And I said, but you see, the one room where I don't need a view is actually the study because once you get in to the writing, you don't notice anything else. And space, you know, we talk a lot about writing space and all of that. I think the journalist training, I learned how to write anyway. I wrote The Wildings and The Hundred Names of Darkness and part of The Girl Who Ate Books on the dining table in our Jangpura house. I wrote The Rest of the Girl Who Ate Books in an empty house of a friend's in Goa. And I think that was one of my happiest writing experiences in a strange way because the house being so, it had some sticks of furniture, but otherwise it was just me and the monsoon and the book. And I don't think it made the writing better, you know, we keep hoping that miraculously space will turn you into a great writer and no, you know, those essays are very much, you can see something growing in them, but they're very much apprentices at the same time. And I wrote Black River and edited a lot of my anthologies in a kind of study, which is also a laundry room. And some of the fact that it's those two spaces at the same time keeps it here. Do I aspire to have my own study someday, maybe in a theoretical way, but in actual fact, some years back, I was lucky enough to get a residency at Bellagio in Italy. And we were given these incredible studies, they really look after you out there. And it's wonderful intellectual experience because you're meeting other practitioners in different fields, not just writers. And every few evenings or so somebody gives a talk about their work. And it's like a college education, it really is. But the first day, I walk into the bedroom is beautiful enough. And then I find that I've been given a study that overlooks Lake Como, and has perfectly appointed with the desk here and the printer there. And it's only your space and this peace and quiet and even your lunch is going to be dropped outside your door. And I sat down and I fell apart and I couldn't write for the first day. I just couldn't write. There was something in me that said, how can I now create work in my haphazard way, when the space demands serious work? You know, how can I write a frivolous line? How can I write a bad line? And I'm joking about it, but it was a real problem. I just sat there for a day, totally stressed out looking at this beautiful lake and saying, I'm supposed to be a writer capital W out here. And until now, I've been a writer small w, which is what I'm comfortable with. And it was only the next day when I was said, okay, you know, just get over yourself and write something. And then things were fine. So I don't know about that formal study. You know, would it would I approach it? Would I use it? Would I look at it with great satisfaction and arrange my books and the books I love most around there and then never use it and just go back to a dining table? Where do you create your work? What enables you? Are you asking me? I was just thinking aloud and I was yes, I am because you know, you're a writer too. And I was asking, I guess what you need. I need silence more than anything else. I can't write in a cafe, but I can write almost anywhere else. I can write in a, you know, bus coming down from the hills. If everyone's sleeping, I can write on a railway station because somehow that noise doesn't"

        "message": "disturb me. That's a remarkable ability. In my case, the difficulty that I've had is something that doesn't seem to have been a difficulty with you, which is just being sort of able to sit down and get the writing done and focus on the processes like I can when I am, you know, when I have to, when I'm so inclined, write anywhere that's doable. But in general, I am prey to distractions. That is something that I keep fighting, though I really can't complain about having a study because I have now, you know, a few years ago, I asked myself the question, what is happiness for me? What will make me happy? And I came up with three things. And one of them was that I want a room full of books. The second thing was I want that room to be air conditioned. And the third thing was that I want to sit comfortably on a lazy boy or such like in that room and read books. And I had the books and I had the room and I had the air conditioning and I ordered a lazy boy right away that same day. And then I said that, okay, I have no reason to complain, I've got everything. And where I currently am in Mumbai is I've got a home studio, cum a writing room, I've got a nice huge sit stand desk from Ikea, I've got a fantastic view from the 27th floor of a building, I've really got it all. But I think finally, the study you have to build is in your head where you have to find that space in your head where you can actually sit down and write and free yourself from distractions, which is something that I struggle with. But I'll, you know, I'll segue from that brief self-indulgent digression brought about by your question and ask and turn it on you and ask you what is your idea of happiness and how has it been redefined? Because for me, a fundamental shift was figuring out when I reached middle age, that when we are young, we can make the mistake of focusing too much on goals, that I want to achieve this, write this many books, get this many awards, be a writer with a capital A. Whereas the happiness is in the small joys, those goals can actually be toxic, because they can give you anxiety and stress and frustration and sadness. But if you just revel in the small joys, because happiness is a choice, it's not something that happens to you, you can choose to be happy. And one way of choosing to be happy is by seeing the many ways in which you are fortunate. And, you know, just reveling in that and that for me would perhaps mean now that I think of it, you said it so beautifully, writer with a capital W, that could mean turning from a writer with a capital W to turning with the small w writer, right? So how have you sort of looked at your life? Like, what did you want when you were younger? What do you want today with the passage of years, like, if you had to go back to the young Nilanjana of 25 years ago, and give her advice that would make her happier in her journey? What would you tell her?"

        "message": "I tell her to stop worrying about what other people thought. And I would just tell her to trust her instincts, and to trust her talent for joy, because that was one of the gifts I always had. I don't know why. But it's been a great gift just to some people. It runs hand in hand with the tendency to some melancholy or obsession when the country is going through a phase like this. But I think one of the things I realized over time was, I was often retrospectively happy. You see, it's now looking back, I don't see a time ever in any decade that I remember that I've read about when India was perfect. But I do know empirically speaking, that the 1990s and the 2000s, for all the flaws of the country and for all the moments of, you know, when one person or another was persecuted, I do know that the air of the country was freer. And in retrospect, I look back and instead of choosing to be sad or dismayed today, I tell myself that we were very lucky to know what it's like to be in a reasonably free country and to have that expectation from the people who are supposed to serve us and who actually rule us. In terms of writing for years, I think I lived a very stressed out life in my 20s and 30s. The 30s parts of it were difficult beyond measure, I don't want to talk about all of that. But I was still dealing with the debris from the past. On the surface of things, I could tell myself that whatever sadness I was dealing with was shared by many other people who are similar. But the truth is, I had suppressed some of that pain for many years and when it came bursting out, it came bursting out in ways that were extremely destructive. And it's funny how you come through that kind of despair into a kind of honesty. At some point, you realize there's no point really being false to yourself. There's no point also sorrowing too much about a past that cannot be changed. And you take one step after another into, we keep talking about healing, but I think back into life, into a life that you had so briefly but emphatically abandoned. And for me, writing became easy when I gave myself permission to feel. For years, I'd been held back by the fact that I had been such a reader. And I used to just start off a project and then stop thinking, you know, but Nadine Gordimer, but Alice Munro, how can I ever write anything of that beauty, but this, but that. And at some point I said, okay, I don't care, you know, there's a story that's bursting out of me. There are characters walking around in my head, there's this thing I can see. And let me at least just get that down to paper. And when I did, and I had a book, I said, I don't care if people love, I don't care if they don't love this, let me just do it for the work. And somehow that freed something in me. Of course, I don't mean that you just write any old thing down. There's a value to, you know, the whole thing of not just craft, but trying to find your voice and trying to be true to the story and messing it up and, but at the same time trying to do your best to it. At some point, you see, what happened was, now if I ask myself what I lack, what's getting in the way of happiness, there's uncertainty, there's sadness about the pathways that many of my country people have chosen. There's great fear for a lot of people I love, who have already been touched by the grimness of these times. All right. And none of that is in my power to change, except in very small ways through acts of tiny empathy or something of the sort. I'm not an activist, I'm not a politician. I have a powerful voice sometimes. But these days, it's become such a game of hopscotch for everybody to figure out what they can say and what they can't say. And I find that even friends who used to be very outspoken and very fearless have been ground down a little bit. That's the unhappy side of things. And the greatest part of my unhappiness is just, you know, like a child, you're saying again, I wish people were good to each other, I wish people stopped fighting each other, I wish there was no war, I wish this, I wish that, right? The part where I draw an abiding amount of happiness from is something that sounds cheesy, but that I actually believe that everybody should do. I started a gratitude practice many years ago, along with a little bit of meditation. The meditation practice, which I continue is probably a failure, I'm still the same person I was, I still have the same flaws, I still have a temper, you know. It has not turned me into a wonderfully spiritual, serene person. It has just deepened a few things for me and the value of that has been inexpressible. But I started first very self-consciously, and then with increasing gladness, a gratitude practice and it taught me one of those old truths, you know, it's like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, there's no place like home, you're already where you need to be, you just need to click on the ruby snippers thrice. And I think what it taught me is there are things I could theoretically change, I could ask for a home or a study or this success or that success, but there's never been a time in my life that I've been without friends, without love, without books, without joy, without curiosity, even in the saddest, most despairing moments, there's been solidarity. There's been a movement towards more integrity, and by integrity I don't mean just verbal lip service honesty, I mean an integrity of being, you know, where all the disparate parts of you start to come together and where you start to hopefully live and write for yourself. I don't like being selfish, but I do have a lot of self-respect these days, and to my surprise I find that my happiness is here, my happiness is right here, in the middle of imperfection and chaos and all of that. But I don't think there has been a day when I haven't been aware, and I don't mean in a smarmy way, I just mean that there hasn't been a day when I haven't been aware of the limitless possibilities of life, writing, reading, life, creating, just being around friends we are given so much. And it's helped me to pay attention to that, it's helped me to just feel not, you know, a writer capital W, but just somebody who is part of this flow that we are all immersed in whether we know it or not, of just trying to, you know, just trying to spend our lives not necessarily doing something grand or grandiose or, you know, filled with vast meaning, but tiny little things, you know, that taken together just make your life a little better and hopefully appeal to others as well, just that."

        "message": "You know, you mentioned not wanting to be selfish, but I was just advising a friend of mine yesterday on a situation that he's found himself in. And I told him that when you want to be empathetic, you should always also remember to be empathetic towards yourself. And not just empathetic towards yourself at this current moment, but also perhaps empathetic towards your future self. And think about how everything that you do today and every choice that you make today impacts your future self as well. So that's kind of just thinking aloud a broader question again, which is also in a sense, I guess, a personal question, but is also a broader question, because it'll get you talking about the country in these times, if you are all fish swimming in water and not noticing the water, that water also in India, that water also is our linguistic heritage in the sense of wonderful languages we are surrounded by, like one of the ways in which I think this is a great country to be a writer in is not just that we are surrounded by so many stories that there is so much happening around us, but also that we have access to so many languages that by default, all of us are sort of multilingual. And you know, that has an importance you've written in your book about Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's experiments with, you know, writing in English and so on. And you've also mentioned earlier in this conversation about the dilemmas over authenticity and the different languages and you mentioned you don't write in Hindi because of Akat. How deep a role does being able to read and write and listen and talk in other languages play in even sort of what we write in English, for example, because I would imagine that our imaginative life and all of that is just deeper and richer because we have access to so many worlds and languages are a big part of that. And as a corollary to that, is it then a worry that there might at some point be a certain homogenization happening in terms of the languages that we speak, where if you look at every language like you correctly, I think mentioned earlier in this conversation, that if Hindi is a river, there are hundreds of tributaries, you didn't use these words, but I'm stuck with river and tributaries now, and so on and so forth. And there's a danger then that and of course, there was a political movement to go towards a particular kind of Hindi where all you know, the Shudh Hindi where Persian and Arabic and all those influences has been stripped away and that movement can never succeed because people speak the way they speak. But in the same way that you know, bananas were sort of homogenized, like I had an episode with our mutual friend Vikram doctor a long time ago on Indian food, and he spoke about the Cavendish banana, that there is something called a Cavendish banana, which India export that you know, it goes from India to the world. And then out there, it is mass produced, and it has these certain merits, which are, you know, which work for it, one of them being that it stays well, and so on and so forth. And then it completely dominates the Western landscape, and then they export it back here. And now it is rapidly replacing all indigenous kind of bananas, and we have a diversity of bananas. And somehow, if you go to a supermarket today, the chances are that all you'll find is a Cavendish banana unless you know, which local market to go to and where to look and all of that. And I worried that there might be sort of a similar thing happening to language in two ways. One is that English has become such a tremendous language of aspiration, that people just gravitate towards that. And there might be local, sort of local cultures which might be lost because of that. And, and also within the languages itself, there seems to be a mainstreaming, like a friend of mine who writes in a particular dialect of Kannada was sharing his sort of situation with me where he said that my instinct is to write in this Kannada, which I grew up in speaking, thinking and all that. But the point is that if I do this, you forget the wider market. But even within Kannada audiences, he'll be a tiny niche and may just die out because some dialects are dying, some languages are dying. So you know, given all the writing and the reading that you've done that you've read so much in multiple languages as well, which to my shame, I haven't, you know, what are what are sort of your thoughts on this?"

        "message": "I was thinking of J. N. Devi's work, Professor J. N. Devi's work, you know, the great scholar who's been spent a lifetime practically now, championing, defending, tracking, mapping the many languages that we have. That river keeps coming back from time to time. So you think of what happens to a river when it's dammed and when it loses its natural flow and starts going stagnant. That's what you do when you try to play power games with one language or the other. What I find fascinating about English, it's been around only for three centuries. It is a little bit of a strangler fig, you know, as a language where English comes in. The language that I lost in between English, Bengali and Hindi was my father's language, Uriya. Because, you know, somehow you're trying to keep all of those, you need to speak Hindi because you're in Delhi, Bengali is the home, you know, it just is home. And English is the language in which you conduct your life. You see what I mean? You can have two languages to dream in. Very few of us can dream in more than that. So the fear among a lot of people who watch Indian languages is that you also don't want a language, one of the big five or six, Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam. You don't want them to drown out the others. I don't think we realize or we keep coming back in this conversation to what you value. Do you value becoming a best-selling writer or do you value the work itself? Is there a tension between the two things or can you make that work on the same page? And with languages, it's an automatic belief that bigger, more speakers is better, robs us of a lot of sweetness. I remember when translators came to Hindi first, there's also a generational learning with translation, right? So the first translators of Hindi and Bengali would translate archaic Bengali into archaic English and then we left with the language that was dead on the page, that had none of the life of English or none of the life of Bengali either. Over time, they've learned to dance, you know, translators like Arunava Sinha in Bengali or, you know, a score of others, Kanyan Raman, etc. They sing. There's a recent translation of Alipura Gyan and Geetanjali Shree, of course, DZ Rockwell, where you can sense these two languages in communication, you know, sort of overlapping, dancing, but very comfortable with each other. I think we, often the hunger for us growing up as young, aspirational parts of this new modernizing India and modernity was a big thing. The focus was on almost relentlessly on, you must learn French or Spanish or German or something like that in order to be a true world citizen and who was saying, if you come from the north or the east, why don't you want to learn Kannada, Telugu, Madhyama, Tamil, you know, it took me years to understand the kind of legacy that we have out here. The projects about sanitization, Vikram Dokta is wise with his story about the Cavendish banana because it's not that it can't happen. Give these things enough time and enough political force and money behind them and one dominant kind of Hindi can take over or one dominant kind of any other language, English or whatever. But if you notice how much Indians have changed English, first we came to it and we're writing like the English many centuries ago, but we're taking away their daffodils and putting in our Amalthas. You know, we are writing like the golden and the silver poets, but somewhere there's an Indian place setting at least moving in. Then a few more generations go by, we start getting comfortable with this alien tongue and then we start pushing it towards our forms of writing. A few more generations and a Rushdie emerges before him, there's a JV Desani. These rivers of language are alive. What we endanger of in this country is choking off the tiny streams, you see, or even when Gitanjali Shree won the Booker International, it was a big moment, but there was an immediate sense of this will benefit Hindi language books. This country has so many languages, why shouldn't it benefit all of those? And as far as the West is concerned, and I'm speaking directly of the market here, not of the people of the West, I found it tragic that people either separate Indian writing in English from translations. That's not how I read, that's not how anybody reads. And you shouldn't feel ashamed about not reading in your local language, it's just, I know everyone has a paucity of time and it's hard enough to keep up with reading in one language. It's a pleasure to discover that, if you ever have the time for it at some point of time. We don't like going back to being learners, but it is one of the greatest joys of your life. I felt like my Hindi and Bengali was stronger and I could write in them with as much fluency as I read. How has reading in them changed me? Inexorably, I don't really know whether I'm an Indian English writer or I'm just an Indian writer or whether I'm just a writer floating around in space. But somewhere at the back of my English, there are all the worlds of an Asha Poornadevi or Mahasweta Devi in Bangla. I don't know how they influenced me. I just know that they're there and I know that I can't imagine my, I don't have to choose thankfully, but I can't imagine my writing without the poetry of Agye and Akshay Mukul of course is going to be doing that biography, or I can't imagine it without the translations I read of Manto's short stories or Ismat Chuktai, Kurutulain Haider, Amrita Preetam, there's a world out there, they're mine, you know, and I love being able to claim all of them from Girish Karnad to all the writers I love, they're mine, I don't have to choose between those different heritages."

I could go on forever, but, you know, just maybe it's best to stop and use these as starting points and let everyone do their own exploring in among their bookshelves. But these are some of my favorites, these are not all of the books that have impacted me."

But let's see, there are books that I've loved, there's books that I've enjoyed, and there are books that have shaped me at different parts of my life. And one last one, you know, that's been enduring has been A.K. Ramanuja. His poems, his essays. I think sometimes when a writer's essays is banned, you only see them through that lens. But A.K. Ramanuja's translations of Sangam poets were among the first things that just made me realize that the past is not yet over, that it's still something that can speak to us directly across the centuries. And everything that he wrote about our common heritage of folktales, how to read a myth, how to understand it as part of our history, but not so rigid, not so damaging, something that is open and expansive. I think I gravitate instinctively to those Indian writers who made themselves at home in the world. And so the last one, one of my old favorites, Kabir, of course. You can either read his poems in the original, or you can read Arvind Krishna Mehrotra's radical re-translations and transmigrations of them, but just go for it either way."

And what you're sort of reminding us with this is that we all actually swim in the same river, you know, from the past to now and so on and so forth. So thank you so much for coming on the show."
