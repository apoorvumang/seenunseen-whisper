But I kept myself open to learning and realised that all my priors about this medium were wrong. I did not have to cater to short attention spans. People want depth, they want nuance, they want serious discussion that is not about scoring points or gotcha moments. And they are interested in human beings as much as ideas. Over this time, the show has evolved from 20 minute glimpses of public policy to 2 hour deep dives into subjects to 5 hour conversations that are akin to oral history. And the deeper my dives, the deeper your engagement. So I want to thank all of you for the love you've given me which keeps me going. This is not just a matter of great numbers. This show is kept alive and financially viable by the contributions of listeners. To bring up an old trope of mine, your love ain't just some abstract thing. It's concrete and I feel it every day. So thank you again. Now, I celebrated episode 200 with a mega conversation curated by Shruti Rajgopalan, in which a whole bunch of my guests asked me questions. For episode 300, I've decided not to do something so elaborate, but just get a special guest. That's what I've done."

        "message": "Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Pratap Bhanu Mehta. And I was almost tempted not to record the intro for this episode because Pratap needs no introduction. Pratap is one of my intellectual heroes, and I've learned a lot from him over the years, not just from his writing, but his way of thinking about a subject. All of us, we dig deep as far as our capacity allows, and then we stop. And the narratives we have are the narratives we have. But Pratap digs deeper into whatever subject he cares about and keeps himself open more than anyone else I know. Whenever I read him or interact with him, I feel like I need to step back and learn that all my reading so far is inadequate. He was my guest in episode 186 of the show, and many people still refer to that as their favorite episode. Do listen to that if you haven't already. These two are like companion conversations in a sense. Now, that earlier episode was recorded remotely. And oddly enough, we hadn't met in person until I went to Delhi this August and invited him for this chat. We spoke about the world and the self, about the personal and the political, about how the shape of the world is shifting, and how we can try to make sense of it. There is more insight per minute in this conversation than in perhaps any episode I've recorded. And in it, you'll also hear him mention the great Dalit scholar Chandrabhan Prasad. And when I told him, hey, I invited Chandrabhan ji to the show and he declined, Pratap said, don't worry, I'll make it happen. And he did. And that episode actually released before this one three weeks ago. That's just one instance of the kindness I refer to. Anyway, check out this conversation. I loved it so much. But first, let's take a quick commercial break. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called FutureStack, which helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. FutureStack batches start every Saturday. What's more, you get a discount of a whopping 2500 rupees 2500 if you use the discount code UNSEEN. So head on over to CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com and use the code UNSEEN. Up Level Yourself. Pratap, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you for having me. I'm so glad to be recording this in person. The last time we recorded was August 2020. And that of course had to be a remote recording because COVID and all of us were kind of hunkered down. And I wanted to start by sort of asking you how in these months, you know how life has changed in the sense that I often feel and looking at myself as well, that all of this, you know, when you move to a different way of life, for example, when I left full time employment, more than a decade and a half ago and started working, the texture of your day change, you know, what you do with your time changes, your incentives change in terms of the things that drive you to action and the things that don't. And that changes the work you do that changes the person you are, so on and so forth. And in a sense, you know, one COVID I think forced upon all of us a different kind of rhythm of existence, where for many men, certainly it we've had the luxury of, you know, perhaps a slower rhythm at times where you're not always up and about for many women, it's a faster, choppier rhythm, because there's so much more to deal with at home without household help, and so on and so forth. But in your case, how has the texture of your day changed in a sense? And would that same kind of change also apply in terms of no longer running an institution like in the past, you were running CPR, and then you were at Ashoka, and you're much more independent in a sense now. So how has change been for you in that"

And I think for that profession, control over your time has always been, I think, much easier than in almost any other profession. And, you know, so at one level, I think if you're a writer, you know, COVID was actually a godsend in some ways. I mean, you had the luxury of just sitting and writing, you didn't have the usual phone calls disturbing you. So the sense of control over your time, at least, I think was immense. I think the flip side of it is that your sense of how the world operates, I think subconsciously, I think changed quite dramatically without you realizing it. Partly, I think, you know, the last two years have also coincided with lots of tectonic changes in the world, geopolitical changes, economic changes. And I think what COVID did was just add to that sense of uncertainty, you're just much less in command, as it were, or much less confident about your own judgments about what's happening in the world. I mean, it's like making a call in the virus, right? When to mask, when is it safe? When is it not safe? So that sense of uncertainty, and I think anxiety, I think has also become a part of a kind of existential, I think, you know, condition. But I have to say, I've also been surprised by just how quickly the world has rebounded from COVID. I mean, yes, we can talk about, you know, changes and rhythms. And I think, as I said, I think for our professions, it's easier. It is gendered, as you rightly, you know, said. But if you travel the last six to seven months, frankly, COVID seems like a distant gleam, at least in the public space. I mean, obviously, it is affecting a lot of lives still. The death rates are still quite high in many countries. And this has been true of humanity in general, right? We always think of these catastrophic events, right? The Spanish influenza, right? You know, humanity was back to being what it was two or three years later. So perhaps in a couple of years, we look back and say, maybe it wasn't as tectonic a shift in our lifestyles, as perhaps it should have been. That's also that's a good news story, because it shows a certain kind of resilience. It may not be a good news story for that means is we're not learning"

I mean, you can take any arbitrarily cut off date, people born in the late 60s, early 70s. And given the privileged positions we've occupied, one, we've never had to contemplate a truly human scale, global scale catastrophe in our lifetimes. I mean, we had, we have no memory of what that is like, right? Our dominant mythology is constant improvement, the promise of greater control over our environment, the promise of actually pretty much being able to do anything at will, I mean, at least aspirationally, even if it's not accessible to everyone, right. And so just the consciousness, right, that actually, we might be at a moment where those things which we had relegated to the past, because we were so confident of our control of nature, right, there will be no major pandemic, there will be no major climate change induced catastrophe, or even if climate change affects it, it's something we can control. Nuclear war, interestingly, right, non negligible risk. So I think we are, for our generation, I think it's the first time where you're actually having to think about those things that humanity periodically always had to throughout its existence till, you know, till maybe 1945, you know, or something. So that's, I think, one, you know, and we never know what those changes actually do. I think those changes will play in our psyche, subconsciously and slowly. I mean, in a sense, we'll see that visible marks, I think, in a while, because partly because of the global scale of these challenges, it's not, it's not easy to come up with answers of what are we supposed to do about it. If you look at the decline of civilisations, right, particularly climate induced decline of civilisations, I mean, history is littered with civilisations, right, that were pretty confident. I mean, we don't know how many of them declined in this valley or whatever. But these civilisations continue until one day they don't, right. You just look at, you know, the heat wave this year, right? I mean, the idea that the major rivers of every country from China to France to the United States are running dry is truly staggering. I mean, what it actually does to, you know, our sense of possibility. So I think it's for the first time again, that we are having to think in planetary terms, because a planetary catastrophe is actually"

        "message": "not a non-negligible possibility. So, you know, you kind of mentioned how, you know, civilisations assume they're dominant until one day they're not there. And that reminded me of this lovely quote by Douglas Adams, which I'm just going to sort of read out, quote, imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, this is an interesting world I find myself in an interesting hole I find myself in fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it. This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up, and as gradually the puddle gets smaller and smaller, is still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this world was meant to have a minute was built to have a minute. So the moment it disappears, catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for stop code. And you know, when you speak about the inevitable, how progress is inevitable, that that notion that you know, the arc of history is going towards a good place. And I must confess that that's what I believed as well. I think it was a default way of thinking for a lot of people that, you know, you assumed with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall breaking down all of that, you assume that it was indeed, as Fukuyama said, the end of history, though, I mean, obviously, that's a very misinterpreted essay. But that the general sentiment of the misinterpretation also was something that many people believed in, that we've solved many of these problems, the authoritarian horrors of the past are surely behind us. And wherever they do exist, it will gradually recede in front of the, you know, undeniable logic of freedom, and so on and so forth. And, and I think so many of us have had to sort of recast that notion in the last few years, to the extent that many will still say it's a cycle, but it's going to turn back, this moment can't last forever. You know, what are your thoughts on reconsidering this? And the thing is that once we decided that that is the way the world was, that progress was inevitable, we also build narratives to explain why that was so, and that fed into a framework through which we looked at the world. And if the fact is that progress wasn't inevitable, that we can go backwards, then all of those frameworks also collapse. So in what ways have you sort of changed your thinking? Like, what are the major ways in which you've kind of changed or refined your thinking in the last few years? And would you say that this is still something that intellectuals or thinkers or so on are, you know, coming to terms with?"

        "message": "Gosh, as always, what a wonderfully big and profound question. And, and, you know, you've opened the door now to speculation. Hope you won't have bias regret. Maybe this is a good moment to kind of step back a little bit from the immediate moment. And I think just using Fukuyama as a kind of benchmark, I think, to look back at the arc of history over, let's say, the last 150, 200 years, right? Now, it seems to me that, you know, when you and I had a confidence in progress, broadly speaking, right? In a way, it had three different strands to it. One is what you might call technological confidence. I mean, that's the project of the modern world, which is increasing mastery over nature, right, to be able to deliver pretty much what we want at whim, right? The different names to it, rationalization of the world, where more and more of the world comes under our control, right? And our confidence about that took this really radical form that we could actually remake nature, right? That we could somehow remake the planetary system, we had a kind of infrastructure species in some ways, right? You can literally alter the face of the globe. But now there are different varieties of it, you know, not just science fiction fantasies, but you know, altering your genes. So, that sense of the radical reconstitution of nature, not just mastery of nature, radical reconstitution of nature is something that I think had become, I think, common sense, right, for, I think, many of us. And if you look at the current moment, the only people who seem to be optimists are people who are still in that techno solution space. I mean, that's like a whole sort of, you know, different universe. What energy crisis, you know, the cost of solar will be zero in five years, we'll be fine. What fruit crisis, we can synthesize plant based proteins and labs, we'll be fine in five years, right? But I think the question in some senses is whether this techno solutionism, right, is actually the right or the adequate approach to this moment. So, that's, I think, one, I think, you know, I think, in some senses, long term. The second project, which was, I think, an interesting one, which I think comes out of the French revolutionary tradition, but I think is at the heart of almost all modern politics, right, is creating a political order that is a product of our conscious design, right, which, in a sense, not just reflects our status as free and equal people, but in some senses, is not confined by the encumbrances of historical necessity, right? There's something veiled about it, there's something legitimate about it, there's something justified about it. And I think one of the paradoxes, I think, of our particular moment is that ambition of creating a social order that would be justified to all. That's actually the ambition we gave up the first, right? So, we think of the nation-state form and capitalism, just to take two social forms, as kind of more or less necessary for our social existence, in a way in which we aren't even taking nature as necessary for our social existence, right? I mean, there's a kind of weight of necessity that comes to our social arrangements, that is actually quite surprising. I mean, that in some senses, you know, that's the paradox of modernity, right? We were supposed to remake our societies, we've ended up remaking nature, without quite remaking our societies. And at this moment, right, that poses a particular challenge, which is that if you actually have this crisis around, let's say, climate change, around nature, around this project of mastery, are these two institutional forms, the nation-state form, and broadly capitalism, I'm using it loosely at the moment, are they actually fit for purpose for solving the problems that we actually need to solve? Are they the solution? Are they in some sense, as part of the problem? And how much of the kind of sense of crisis that we have is the sense that, you know, they've delivered lots of goods. I mean, you can't imagine modern citizenship outside the nation-state. You can't imagine liberating the individual in some senses, from the oppression of tradition outside of the confines of the nation-state often. Capitalism, certainly in some forms, at least, has delivered extraordinary levels of material prosperity to certain parts of the world. But I think there is a palpable sense that we've kind of plateaued in some senses on what they can actually provide, and whether they can actually solve anything this problem. So, you know, it's an interesting moment where you're kind of opening yourself up to at least much more bigger scale thinking, that maybe the solution will not just be tinkering at the edges, it will require slightly more radically reimagination of our social forms, holding on to what's important in them, right? But in some senses, creatively, I think transcending that. The third, I think, feature, right, which, in some senses, was this question of, and I know this is a subject that's close to your heart amongst others, you've written eloquently about this, the dignity of the individual and individual freedom, right? That both the enterprise of liberalism and democracy, psychologically, they rely on a certain kind of presumptive trust that people have in each other, right? That's partly why you can leave them to their own devices. But the presumptive trust is not just that they're going to be good at making judgements about things that affect them. But the presumptive trust also requires a certain kind of reciprocity. That's why in some senses, equality and liberty have always gone together. I mean, it's equal liberty for all in some ways, right? That's very important. And I think one of the challenges, I think, in some senses, we see is the foundations of what creates societies where there is an adequate level of reciprocity, right? And I think reciprocity is the key term here, because everything else follows from reciprocity, right? Whether I respect your liberty, and you respect mine, I mean, that's a form of reciprocity. What are the conditions under which forms of reciprocity are created, right, that can sustain levels of trust? I don't think we have a good handle on that. Some societies for a little while seem to have it a little more than others. But the crisis of authoritarianism, the crisis of liberal democracy, the crisis of freedom is in part this complete absence of reciprocity, right? Which makes any projects for furthering each other's freedom seem almost impossible."

        "message": "Yeah, and, you know, you went on Shruti's podcast, and you spoke about Adam Smith. And this is like one of the fundamental points you made, which, you know, made me think a lot about, you know, it's not just about self interest in Smith's work, it's about reciprocity. And that goes a bit deeper. In the last episode that we did together, like one of the things I mentioned that I think about, from time to time, is how, if I look at the story of human progress, especially perhaps since the Enlightenment, one narrative that is there is about how we are using reason, which of course, we are we are wired to have reason, but we are using reason to sort of mitigate the negative aspects of our hardwiring, right. And of course, we have contradictory hardwiring, we are hardwired for both tribalism and altruism, and so on and so forth. But we mitigate the negative aspects of that by actually, you know, thinking about it and realizing that no, you know, I might be hardwired to have kids, but I don't want kids, or I might be hardwired to be tribalistic and hate the other but hey, no, we are all the same, right? And you use reason in that sense. And it seems to me that that might, you know, in a way, again, there was an illusion of progress there, that, you know, reason is proceeding. But in a way, it may be a bit of a losing battle, or at least a really difficult battle, if I look at modern times, because every newborn baby is born with the hardwiring that is there, but without, you know, the rest of the work remains. And it's so easy for those knobs to be turned, as it were the tribalism knob and the violence knob and all of those kind of knobs to be turned. So that's sort of what you know, what kind of worries me a bit. And in a sense, I think also, the tech solution solutionism that you mentioned, could also, you know, have relevance with how a lot of people think about the second problem that you mentioned about a political order and capitalism and all of that. And my sense is that we are the tech solution solutionism takes us to a space where we imagine that all problems are solvable. Now, obviously, all problems are not solvable, there will be a time the planet won't exist at all, there will be a time much before that, that humans won't exist on the planet. And those are long term problems, but we can push them away. But you know what I think, you know, capitalism and building certain political orders with institutions and all of that can solve limited problems, but not deeper problems. For example, capitalism can help people get what they desire, but it cannot shape what they desire. Right? And if what they desire is not something that we with a liberal mindset would consider, hey, these are the things you should desire, then we sort of have an issue there. I mean, I'm kind of rambling a bit, but I totally get where you're coming from. And I'll ask you to double click on the second of those points. You know, in a different space, you've also written about how we are prisoners of an 18th century conception when it comes to the state and its institutions and all that. Can you elaborate on that a bit?"

        "time": "00:24:40.000",
        "message": "So with your permission, can I back up to your very important point about reason, actually, because I actually think it is something we don't get to discuss often. I mean, I think in some ways, you know, I think we, as you said, reason has become, again, a common part of our kind of ideological repertoire and we move forward with it. So when we think of reason, right, and, you know, whether you take the Enlightenment Project, but not just the Enlightenment Project, I mean, I think sometimes identifying reason with the Enlightenment Project, you know, also makes it much more culturally specific than reason is. I mean, you know, there have been rational people, rational thinkers all across, right? I think we have to understand three or four things about reason, right? And this is the hard part, I think. So one, I think is, look, even rationality as a history in some ways. And by that, I mean, not the proposition that everything is relative to culture, right? But things that are taken as expressions of rational behaviour will actually vary. And in some senses, reason itself cannot adjudicate between that variation, right? What do you want to optimise on in your life? Right? Lots of plausible candidates, right? Most of them are probably rational candidates, right? I mean, you could make a case for them after reflection, right? But reason in some senses is always going to under-determine many of the ends we would want to actually pursue. And I think this is an insight I think pluralists have had everywhere. I mean, whether it's kind of Jain Anekant Vards, or, you know, Isaiah Berlin in some senses, right? That the idea that reason over-determines your choices, right? The way we think of it in mathematics, once you've seen two plus two equals four, you cannot but believe that and there is no other option, right? For most of the things that in some senses matter to our lives, right? Reason will under-determine your choices. And I think a lot of the pulls we feel around the conflicts of values, right? The harder cases are one where there are actually between reasonable choices. It's not that people I mean, it's not that somebody who says, look, I want to lead a somewhat traditional sedate life, you know, like the comforts of community, like the comforts of predictability, is actually being unreasonable, as opposed to somebody who says, look, I want to jet set across the world, I want to sort of just mix cultures, I want to, I mean, you can make plausible cases that they're actually both fulfilling ways of living a life, right? And it's not clear that reason is going to be able to, in some senses, adjudicate between them, right? So reason under-determines that. The second, I think, challenge with reason is whether the cast of the world is inherently tragic. And by tragic, one just means the idea that lots of good things cannot coexist together, right? So if you are building a community that's actually optimising on familiarity, the comfort of knowing each other intimately, versus building a community where you have the strength of, you know, weak ties, as it were, or let's say, you're optimising on efficiency versus optimising on localism. Again, both are reasonable, in some sense, but both cannot exist in the same social structure in the same social space, right? And I think this is something I think many liberals did understand that I think there is a kind of tragic cast to the world. And I think the excessively rationalist liberalism that actually denies that there is a kind of loss here, is actually missing out something. It itself is being, I think, unreasonable, right? So there's a second, I think, dimension to this, I think, this tragic cast of the world. The third dimension to reason, and now I'm coming to the point about the state in some ways, right, which is perhaps related to the tragic cast of the world, is that, you know, some of the big challenges that we face, do not arise from things that are straightforwardly evil. I mean, that would be easy to, in some senses, pinpoint and identify, right? Let's say, let's take the theme you use tribalism, right? Where I'm in complete agreement with you. I mean, I tend to just think collective pronouns are generally deformations of individual moral life. I think collective pronouns, in some senses, I think, mutilate individuality often in ways that are quite hurtful for both morality and creativity. But if you think of the modern forms of tribalism, what makes them, right, potent, what makes them ominous, is not that, you know, we are tribal, that we want some kind of, you know, fuzzy, ruddy feeling of sort of belonging, or, you know, living in communities that are the same. I mean, you know, there could be versions of that, that are actually quite livable, quite harmless, quite benign. It is that it has become tied with a political form that we actually value for independent reasons, right? So, if you think of modern democracy, right, I mean, what makes modern tribalism really, you know, extraordinary, both in its attraction and in its destructive power, is modern democracy raises the question, who constitutes the people? The question of who is the people is going to raise the question of membership, who gets to be in and who gets to be out. And again, the tragic cast of the world, that unless you believe in a universal community, a form that is actually organized under a single political form, the question of inclusion and exclusion will remain at the heart of democracy. It's unavoidable, right? Modern states require taxation, deep forms of taxation. They do so many more things for us than ancient states and medieval states did. I mean, they literally reconstitute us in every single way from kind of healthcare, education, pastoral care, you just, you know, you can name it, right? So, to generate the kinds of resources they require, requires very different forms of solidarity, right? In some ways, you really do have to think of this as a shared enterprise in a way in which perhaps a medieval citizen doesn't. I mean, you know, kings come and go, politics dances lightly at the surface, so long as you're not messing too much around, right? With either my life or my inherited social forms, I don't particularly care, right? And the modern state was also the necessary instrument for all these technological projects that we imagined in some ways, right? So, we want all those good things from the modern state, right? Democracy, greater enhancement in our collective power, right? But those things also require very different forms of solidarity. And that solidarity has a name in the modern world, which is nationalism. I mean, modern nationalism is modern in some ways. I mean, tribalism has always been around, right? But this form of tribalism then, you know, when it allies two things, right? Greater requirements of identification and solidarity with greater power, because now you also have the state as an instrument, right? You actually have a perfect storm on your hands. So, I think the issue, as the way I see the issue is not, are we hardwired for tribalism? I mean, at a 30,000 feet level, that's probably true that other things being equal, we might feel more comfortable in contexts that are familiar, people that are familiar, certain kinds of solidarities in some senses might be easier, right? That has always been around. But the specific form it takes in the modern nation state, right, is of a completely different order. And as I said, the disquieting news is that a lot of it stems from the good things we want from the state, right? Again, the tragic character of many of these institutions."

        "message": "Yeah, I don't know the work well, but yes, I have. Yeah. So, he carried out these experiments on split brain epilepsy, where apparently for a particular kind of epilepsy, the way to cure it was to severe the corpus callosum, if I remember correctly, basically, what connects the right brain to the left brain, and the right brain controls on the left side of the body and vice versa. You know, while carrying out these procedures on patients like this, he carried out an interesting experiment, where the right side of the brain, which is more intuitive, and all of that would be given a particular instruction, like raise your hand or ask for water or whatever. And the person would do it like if he sees a sign, raise your hand, he'd raise his hand, then he'd be asked, why did you raise your hand? And because there is no connection between the right side and the left side of the brain, the other side of the brain would then make up an explanation for that, that my armpits were itchy. For example, I mean, I'm just kind of thinking aloud in terms of I don't remember the specific examples, but basically, and Gazzaniga's point was that he called the left side of the brain, the interpreter, right? His point was that the person did not raise his hand because the armpit was itchy. But that is what the person actually believes, because a part of the brain, which he called the interpreter came up with that explanation. And to me, this is sort of a metaphor for a larger thing, a larger phenomenon, which is that often we are not reasoning, we are rationalizing, that we do what we do, we follow impulses without even being aware of them ourselves. And then we cloak it in the garb of reason. And I'm sure we both had occasion to think about this in recent times, where both in the US and in India, people who otherwise seemed principled, you know, whether it's people within the Republican Party, who once upon a time supported trade, and so on and so forth, are now supporting Trump, despite the fact that he goes against all the values they deeply believed in, or people in India, for example, who supported Modi in 2014, which is fine, you know, you could support him for good reasons then, but who continued supporting him, after it became apparent that his actions go against all the principles they espouse. And therefore, the conclusion to draw there and a rather depressing conclusion, for me, is that they never really believed in the principles or the worldview that they espoused. They had instead joined a tribe or taken a position and now they are part of that. And they'll rationalize as much as they need to to kind of stay there. And therefore, the thought that comes to my mind is that is reason and illusion, that even when you and me sit, you know, we have also cast ourselves in the world in a particular way, we play a certain role in our little ecosystems, whatever they are, and we are looked at by people in a certain way. And we are going to continue along those paths. Like, for example, I have come to believe that there cannot possibly be free will, it doesn't make sense. However, we must keep behaving as if there is, right. So in a similar sense, and I'm thinking aloud here, that, you know, you could argue that we must continue trying to be reasonable, even though perhaps reason is impossible. Is that then part of the tragic cast of the world, as you say, that we are all playing this game, where even we are not completely in control of what we do and what we think and why?"

        "message": "So there's a lot, there's lots in what you said, actually, and again, very large themes. So one point, which I'll just say and kind of put aside, because I'm not sure I'm kind of competent to talk about it, is there is no question that there is a kind of depth to our psyche that we don't fully understand. And you can come at this through psychoanalysis, whatever else one may think about Freud, I think this idea that in a sense, even our overt reasonable actions may actually be over determined in some senses, thick with causality, in a way which we don't understand. I think that idea is, the text like the Yoga Vashishth in some senses, you know, where our psyche has just layers and layers and layers and layers and what in some senses moves us is not something that is actually fully graspable by us. And in some senses, you know, if you think of the entire Indian tradition, why the problem of consciousness is central to it, right? Because in part, the problem of consciousness is actually related to the problem of reason and unconscious in some ways, right? What would it mean for us to be fully transparent to ourselves? And who is the it that is transparent and who are they transparent to, right? So, in that sense, yes, I mean, I think and you could actually argue that despite advances in science, I think our understanding of the psyche is probably no more sophisticated than it was, you know, when the authors of the Yoga Vashisht or when Plato were writing, I mean, there is a kind of and perhaps I think for those authors, I think it was easier to comprehend it because there wasn't this mythology that we are fully in control of ourselves. So, in some senses that actually, I think much more aware of those kinds of demonic forces, rationalizations that actually take place, right? And that's where I think, you know, I think we do have a kind of question of how far has reason succeeded in bringing enlightenment, right? But there's another aspect, I think the reason rationalization story that he said, which is quite profound, which is, see, fundamentally, when we think of reason, you can think of it as a faculty, right? And this is the way psychologists study it. But there's a reason why most of the thinkers of the Enlightenment, and not just thinkers of the Enlightenment, again, any philosophical tradition has always thought of reason as a social activity. And by social activity, I mean, the idea that the norm of what counts is valid, is inter subjectively validated. It's not just you saying, I have applied my reason, right? If you think of the practice of science, in some senses, right, the practice of science requires agreement upon a method on what counts as valid inference or a valid experiment in some sense, right? Partly it's to check this conflation of subjectivism and reason, right? The surest check of whether it's a rationalization or not is that when you present the logic of your justification, can somebody else enter into that logic of justification and see through it, right? Even Immanuel Kant, I mean, you know, one of the most profound things he said, in a sense, is reason and freedom have an intimate connection. One of the reasons we value freedom is in part to make this inter subject exchange as free as possible, right? Now, the question then becomes in what are the areas, right, where you have a reasonable level of inter subjective agreement over what counts as a reasonable answer to this question. And again, to put it a little bit crudely, I mean, this is a gross oversimplification, but many would argue that in the case of certain forms of science and mathematics, that is probably in some sense of the case, philosophical logic, right? Now, there was this hope that the same kind of sociality of reason could actually be applied to human affairs, right? That's the big idea of the modern democratic public sphere, right? Only those governments are legitimate that pass laws that are freely accepted by everyone, right? And so you have to engage in dialogue, you have to engage in that reciprocity, right? Now, the problem with that story, to my mind, again, it I think, story to keep harping on the reciprocity themes, is that it actually presupposes that I'm granting you a standing in the same space that I am to begin with. And that's the hardest part in the moral point of view, right? Because once you've granted that, then lots of things become possible, right? So, that was one, I think, weakness in that story that I think we still don't have an account of what is it that induces people to take broadly what we call the moral point of view. And the moral point of view by its character has to be universalizable. The point about universalizability is not that everybody is the same. The point about universalizability is that everybody can partake in the reasoning and see yes, this is a genuine reason, not just your arbitrary whim, right? So, I think that the second thing I think about, I think, this intersubjective agreement in the public sphere is, and this reverts back to the point about the psyche and the unconscious. You know, when we teach political theory, there's one exam question we always set students, which is, what does a particular theorist fear most? Right? And in some senses, you can actually deduce a lot of what they're writing from that fear. I mean, my computer science friend will say the flip side of it is, what are you trying to optimize on most, right? So, those who fear, right, the tyranny of the state end up favoring limited government. Those who fear, let's say, in societies like India, the social experience of incredibly humiliating inequality, right, will perhaps be open to a slightly greater role for the state, right? Now, I think the interesting question to me in all these conversations, the example of the Republicans and so forth, right, is what is the core fear that is getting them to take the position that they are in fact taking? And you can sport a rationalization, right, where either the purported solution is actually not answering the fear that this state is the fear, right? I mean, that's one hint in some senses, right? So, for example, old fashioned conservatives would say that, look, you know, our concern with liberals is they're not ethical, they're not moral, no family values, right? Turns out, you know, Trump's hardly a supporter of family values in any sense. That's a clear case, right, where it's becoming obvious that that was not the fear that was driving you. The family values thing was a code for something else. And now that circumstances have changed, that code in some senses can be, I think, dispensed it. And I think what we are having a hard time, I think, in our democracies is finding a way to articulate and express those fears in a way in which they can become the object of some kind of mutual resolution. Now, one reason for that may be that you don't want a mutual resolution, right? This is often the case between enmity between groups, racism, for example, right? That if it is your unstated fear that the demographic power of your community is going to lose, you've also be socialized by reason enough to say that you can't actually say those things because it violates all kinds of norms of equality and liberty, right? Then you are in a political discourse, where you are being motivated by something that can never be subject to any kind of intersubjective validation. And that's, in a sense, a disaster for politics, right?"

        "message": "Couple of thoughts and the first one just taking off from this is, I mean, I love that question about what do you fear the most? That kind of explains so much. I mean, there is that famous saying about where you stand depends on where you sit. It therefore strikes me that what might be happening in modern politics is therefore this kind of vicious circle where we are all pushed to the extremes. So let us say that there are two parties, let's not call them right and left or conservatives and progressives or whatever. But just in a thought experiment, there are two parties, each one fears the other one gaining dominance, and their expression of that fear is a movement to the extremes of their own position, right? And this is exacerbated by say, social media, which is, which, you know, which amplifies everything and which amplifies this drive to the extremes, because the only way you raise your status within your tribe is by doing more and more posturing and being more and more shrill and judgmental and pure, as it were. And therefore, what happens is that what you fear when you look at the other side, and you see this happening, what you fear is becoming more fearful. And therefore, both sides are becoming more afraid. And as a response to that more and more fearful, till they are eventually caricatures of what they used to be used to be. And there is no longer that sort of middle ground, right? Like, for example, our dominant way of thinking about politics once used to be that there is always this move to the center, like there's a median voter theorem that the Democrats and the Republicans may swing to the extremes in the primaries to get the true believers in, but they'll swing to the center. And therefore, you know, in 2016, the two candidates you would have expected were Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, who are pretty much identical, slight difference in the interest groups which influence them, but they both very centrist. And instead, you had what appeared to be a black swan event, but now no longer seems that way. And it now seems that both parties are, you know, swinging more and more towards their extreme ends. So what's your sense of this? Because just looking at the processes involved in this and the incentives and the imperatives involved in this, it would seem like this is a vicious circle out of which we cannot escape."

        "message": "So I mean, let me kind of dimmer with you a little bit, I think, because again, I think that three or four things that need to be distributed, three or four levels of the argument, I think. So one, I'm actually not convinced entirely that there's evidence that the middle ground is not possible. It's certainly not reflecting in the politics that we are seeing, because the very same opinion polls, right, they show political polarization. Actually, even a lot of issues show a lot of and quite remarkable convergence, actually. I mean, you know, and it is actually remarkable how most issues, most large numbers of people actually turn out to be pretty moderate in some ways. I mean, that's right. So if that is the case, then I think there's a particular question about, is there something about the institutional designs that we have that percolate public opinion, at least with the way they are channeled through politics, that actually produces a polarized politics that is actually quite out of sync, in some senses, with a lot of the values common ground that we have. And I would like to think that I think a lot of it is, I think, I think this is the case, I think there is an institutional story here. In the US, you could probably tell an institutional story about the nature of the primaries. I mean, you know, there's a lot of kind of good literature that one of the reasons you did not see actually all polarization in the old sense, although the US has had a history of it, by the way, I think there's a lot of amnesia around the 50s and the 60s. But even if we grant that, you know, polarization is increased, the way candidates used to be selected, parties used to be more controlled by party bosses, which provided a level of mediation. Actually, one of the paradoxical consequences of primaries is that in primaries, only your base is energized. So in some senses, you're actually appealing to your base, right? There's a second phenomenon, which is the division into red and white states. Now, the reason that that produces radicalism in the parties, right, is that if you're competing, let's say, in a democratic state, the only way you differentiate yourself from your democratic computer is actually by wearing slightly more left, right, which is a very different logic than if you actually had to compete with somebody, you know, on the right where you try and actually triangulate. If you look at the voting patterns, right, I mean, let's not forget, the popular vote still goes in the favor of Democrats. There is the particular artifact of American institutions, which gives lots of veto powers, right, to small minorities, you know, not selected from a small state. So you could actually argue that the processes of channeling popular will, right, are no longer fit for purpose. And again, it goes back to what do you fear most. In the 18th century, right, when the American Constitution was set up, there were two big fears, right? One was the fear of tyranny, right, which was the fear of, you know, monarchy in some ways. And the second was the concern for federalism, because the American compromise rested on allowing slavery, which could be justified only a federal compact. That's why American institutions were denied design the way they were like lots of these little veto points, right? They're trying to answer a slightly different problem from a problem of how do you actually channelize, right, let's say, collective action on climate change, where the very same thing that's actually a virtue, when you want to perhaps defend liberty, right, that maybe five judges can actually hold up a piece of tyrannical legislation, they often did not, that's a different matter, but in principle, they could, actually is a liability, right? Where one senator, who, again, great for federalism, right, every state can exercise power in the system. It turns out that that's a liability. So I think some of the, I think, radicalism question, I think, is actually really about that kind of political institutional design question. There's a thing, a third level that you pointed out, which I think is quite important and deep, and there you feel something about the ground which we are occupying is shifting. That has to do with the nature of modern media and communication, and social media in particular, but not just social media. Now, one way of thinking about that, and again, to kind of step back, you know, look at the longer arc of history. So, you know, most of us assume that proper communication requires the sharing of some context, right? Interpreting any gesture, right? Is it a twitch or a wink to use, you know, the famous example from Gilbert Ryle, right, requires thick knowledge of that context, right? Let us say you tweet tomorrow, right? I don't know, you just tweet a picture of Lord Ganesh, just kind of, you know, there's 55 possible meanings I could attribute to your tweet. Maybe you just like this painting. Maybe you are a devout Ganesh bhakt. Maybe you're subtly trolling somebody, who knows? I mean, you know, maybe you're religious, maybe you're sacrilegious, right? Now, one of the things that I think has happened is that our modern forms of communication, particularly when you're doing it on a mass scale, and without the mediation of organizations, there is a easy decontextualization and recontextualization of everything, right? Which is making the meaning of pretty much anything that you say or do, actually pretty unstable. Now, postmodernists would, you know, point out that we've been always saying this about communication, there's always a kind of slipperiness to communication, right? That what makes meanings of terms intelligible is a lot of that shared context, right? Now, once that opens up, right, you actually have forms of argument, where there's no space, where there's no institutional mechanism for saying, okay, what are the protocols of truth that we share? What counts as a good answer to this question? All you see, in a sense, is the expression of those fears, the expression of, you know, something that by itself actually is quite unintelligible, even without that thick context. Second, what it allows you to do is it allows you to mobilize constituencies that are no longer local, right? So, let's say, for argument's sake, I was a religious conservative. If my focus was my community, right, I might have to come to compromise with you, we have to live together. Now I can actually get empowered by somebody sitting in the US, you know, oh, my God, yes, this is part of my like repertoire, your sense of empowerment, right? And it's quite remarkable, almost all the cultural trends that we see right now, good, bad, right, whether it's the beheading for blasphemy, whether it is wokeism, right, they go global almost instantaneously, right? Now, if your sense of community, in some senses, doesn't put you in a position to actually have to compromise, because you're now drawing your empower, perhaps even your revenue from someplace else, right? Your incentives to communicate in some ways go down. So, there, you know, so it's, you almost feel in the public sphere, imagine a kind of situation where we simply could not communicate with each other, because we don't understand each other's languages, right? I mean, to compliment you, I say, Amit, you're smart, and you hear something else, you hear smart Alec in the word smart, right? Right? Because the context doesn't actually, in some senses, make that clear. So, I think there is something about our information order, something about communications, that is actually making that central enterprise of democracy, which is mutual justifications, I think much more, much more difficult. I just had one last final point in this, because you said something a while ago, which I should have picked up on, you know, this was capitalism can satisfy people's desires, but it cannot make them. You know, the standard critique of capitalism has always been the opposite"

But think of an equilibrium, where every act of communication is really a kind of form of monetization, either in terms, I mean, literally of money, or if nothing else, in terms of fame, right? Where the very activity of communication is actually completely colonized, in some senses, by these imperatives. Now, I'm not saying that that that is actually the case. In fact, it is remarkable to me how when we have conversations like this, we often end up agreeing more. Smaller groups tend to agree more, you take people out to a restaurant and chat with them, they agree more. So it's not that all forms of communication are colonized. But the increasing colonization, and that colonization is also now reflected in each of the institutions of communication, whether it's television, whether it's newspapers, frankly, even universities at the margin, right? Whether that colonization puts us in a situation where we say, actually, we are using words, we are looking at an audience, but we are actually not engaging in communicative rationality with them."

No, I by this point about desire, I'd say it's orthogonal to my point, in the sense that, you know, I remember a few years ago, I was chatting with Pratik Sinha of Alt News. And this was not on record, it was not in the episode I did with him, but offside somewhere. And he mentioned that in his early fact checking days, he came across this fake news that had been spread about some leader. And he tried to get to the bottom of this fake news.

Actually, I don't mean to suggest in fact, I am actually very sceptical of arguments that say that, you know, the root cause of our malaise is actually just these communication structures. And I think there are two reasons for resisting that. I mean, one, of course, you know, it's not the first time in history that you know, human beings are threatening to be at each other's throats. And you know, our ancestors also did that pretty well in different forms, right? But I think the form in which it is channelized does actually make a difference. Because, I mean, you remember that great line from Kant, right? That in a sense, a lot of liberal society's aspirations is to get devils to live together, right? Which is, it's not so much the hope that you know, we are kind of deeply transformed all the way down. It is to create institutional channels where all of this can be in some sense, discharged harmfully or relatively safely, right? And I think that is something that I think this this virality and commercialization can upset in some ways, right? Just by the strength of numbers. I think the second thing, I think, which why one should resist the conclusion that it's all good, is that I think a lot of politics is actually still pretty old fashioned. And I think this is a message the right has grasped, I think, much more strongly than the left, even though the right uses social media, at least until recently, was using it quite effectively, right? Which is that you have to have a certain kind of presence in people's lives, to be able to tap into these latent fears. There's a certain kind of political credibility that familiarity brings, right? That's what civil society organizations of the right do. I mean, even the RSS when it is as its most successful, it doesn't go in there saying, we have come to propagate this ideology. It just makes itself felt and its presence familiar in all kinds of ways. I mean, there's this wonderful book by Long Kumar on, you know, the RSS in the Northeast, the rise of the BJP in the Northeast, an unlikely site for the rise of the BJP. It's a 15-20 year project, you come and you make yourself a useful part of the social fabric. This is what churches and Tea Party did in some senses in the US, right? And I think the interesting question I think for the center that you were talking about is that center, and if you want to call it center-left, has in recent times been much weaker in some senses at creating those structures of familiarity, where people are willing to turn to them and say, yeah, I see, you know, how you might be able to address actually the fears that I have, right? Partly, I think, because we were, I think, victims of our own sort of determinism in some senses, right? There's a logic to democracy that makes it centrist. It's not the work of politics. That was determinism one. It's cross-cutting social identities that make sure that there is no hegemonic victory, right? Determinism number two. And broadly speaking, that was what the centrist platform in India was. I mean, it became entitled in that way. So we just don't have that kind of presence, right? That it actually takes to make people comfortable to mobilize identities. So I do want to, I think, emphasize this point that old fashioned politics actually matters a lot more than we think."

        "message": "So let me go back to something you said earlier, which is a profound point about media, where you pointed out how it's a decontextualizing machine, right? So I might say something which is so easy to take out of context and misinterpret. And my fundamental principle for all interactions is just assume goodwill, right? Assume goodwill, engage in good faith, unless you have reason not to trust that the other person is, you know, means the best and don't take the worst interpretation out of it. Now, I think what this decontextualizing machine therefore does is that it also reduces empathy. Because what happens therefore, is that I keep talking on my show about sort of the distinction between the abstract and the concrete, right? And in the concrete, I can sit with you and we can be friends. In the abstract, somebody might say that, oh, Mr. Mehta is this and Mr. Mehta is that and give me these big abstract terms and I can get carried away by them. Now, while of course, many of the values that I hold dear, like liberty and freedom and so on are abstract terms, are danger in modern times, I think really comes from abstract terms like nationalism and the sense of the other and all of that. You know, a great example of this came from Aanchal Malhotra in an episode she did with me on her book about the memories of partition, where she spoke about how she was in Pakistan, and she was sitting with a family out there and they were talking about what they had endured while coming over. And they were ranting and raving against Hindus before one of them realized that, you know, they have a Hindu with her and they said, Tum nahi beti, tum theek ho. Right. So in the abstract, they hate it in the concrete, they're perfectly okay. And I think what the decontextualizing machine does, is that it creates a kind of thin engagement. And therefore, you're not concrete enough. Like one of the reasons that, you know, my guests don't get trolled for what they say on the show, is that this show is, you know, by virtue of its length and the approach that I take and all of that creates a kind of thick engagement. The kind of people who come here are not the kind of people who are looking for gotcha moments, they understand you, they might disagree with you, but they get it, you're a human being, they're not going to, you know, quote tweet you and attack you on Twitter and all the other sort of nonsense that goes on. And what I think about sometimes, and what I don't have an answer to, is that it seems clear to me that, you know, we need to live more in the concrete to relate with each other as human beings. You go to a cafe today, or you watch a family around a dining table, and everybody is staring into their smartphone in an abstract world that is fleeting and temporary, and so on, and not actually engaging with each other in the concrete. And the question I'm trying to grapple with, again, is that the trend of this increasing seems so strong. How can it be reversed? How can people like us, you know, how can we begin to move again in a direction where, you know, we embrace the concrete a little bit more?"

And I think the three have different logic, so maybe require different kinds of solutions. So the first is to say that, look, there is a first where the articulation of our values is very abstract. I'm for rights, I'm for humanity. And this was an old riposte against the Enlightenment, you know, they love human mankind, but they hate their kindred. I mean, that was the standard trope against Rousseau, you know, in some senses, he loves all of humanity, he just hates his children, right. But there is a more sophisticated version of it, where, which I think globalization enhances, where, you know, our lives are finite, and our attention is finite, and our capabilities are finite. And what that means is, to quote William James's great phrase, we are always going to be partially blind, right? Always, I mean, that just is an existential condition. Now, in a globalized world with this form of communication, our partial blindness is almost always an invitation for somebody else to accuse you of hypocrisy. You're caring about X group of refugees, why not Y? Actually, fair question, as a question of justice, as a question of principle, right? But as a way of in some senses, targeting and impugning somebody, right? Which of us isn't partial in the way we live, we are embodied finite creatures, right? But we are in a generalized condition where I think that sense of finitude and partiality is now actually a kind of weaponized tool against each one of us, right? So, we both have to use abstract terms, like liberty and will be hoist by our own petard. So, that's I think, one kind of abstraction, right? I think the second has to do with nationalism and in particular tribalism, which is a very different kind of abstraction, right? It's a different kind of abstraction in the sense that it's an abstraction that many people feel empowers them, right? And it empowers them partly because it gives us the ability to live vicariously. I mean, I have no batting skills, but I can get a high seeing, you know, Virat Kohli's six, right? And that's the peculiar alchemy of nationalism in some ways. I mean, it really, you know, I think in that sense, it's actually not abstract, the affect it has, right? But in some senses, it has two downsides. One is, of course, that it slots people into boxes, right? At one level, it becomes our sovereign identity. This is the most important thing you are, which you should never be, whatever else the nation might be, it should never be the most important thing you're in your life. I think it's morally deeply problematic. It's, you know, instrumentally useful for various things. But so one, there's a kind of sovereign authority that nationalism claims, right? Which is, I think, destructive of modern life, because in some senses, it impedes a certain kind of universalism. But because it relies on a kind of vicarious identification, it actually takes away from that concreteness and individuality, right? Because in that universe, the first thing when I see you, is your group identification. That's the first slot, right? Everything else will follow after that. Are you an artist? You know, do you have five kids? You know, what drives you? What struggles you have, right? Now, this combination of vicariousness and this will to simplicity is, in a sense, a pretty terrible combination, particularly in ideology that can also then consecrate death. And any ideology that consecrate death by implication also consecrates killing. In that sense, nationalism is the only modern competitor to religion, in where the consecration of death is intrinsic in some senses to its identity, right? And in that sense, I think, the attenuation of nationalism, right, as I said, we are stuck with nationalism because of nation state forms that we have inherited. But the attenuation of nationalism, I think, is definitely an important political project. It's the second, you know, kind of. The third kind of, I think, concreteness and abstraction, right, has to do with, many would argue, the nature of modern life, right? Which, on the one hand, it opens up this world of possibility and diversity, right? But there is a challenge, which is out of this world of diversity and possibility. What are the forms of life that actually give you meaning, right? Now, what happens to, I think, a lot of people is a sense of vertigo, right? There's so many great things to choose from. Reason is not going to help you decide, right, in some ways, right? And that can have two consequences. One, that ultimately your sense of what's important to you is just a function of your passion about it. But then it is your passion. You prioritize your passion, in some senses, ignoring, right, other people's sort of take on this. I mean, you know, and so this critique that there is something, the very mobility and sense of choice that a liberal culture actually affords, also actually makes it prone to a certain kind of abstraction. Because it's not just the fact that you have to pay attention to concreteness. Concreteness also has to come from a certain kind of thickness of engagement. Otherwise, it'll never be concrete, right? And it's a big question, right? Do the modern forms of life allow for those kinds of fixed forms of engagement? Is this also one of the tragic choices we are actually having to make?"

        "message": "The cast of the world indeed is tragic. And the second of your points is also why I find identity politics of all sorts so toxic, whether it is wokeism or bhaktism, which are almost sort of identical to me, because they reduce us to a particular identity of birth. That's how you're looked at. While, you know, people contain multitudes, people are complex, people are thick creatures, as it were not thin creatures. And I want to sort of like, one danger, of course, is in how we construct our personal identity, sometimes from the collective group identity, because that is the easiest to do. But I want to go beyond that a bit and just sort of talk about the construction of the self itself, like earlier, when we were talking about reason and rationalisation, and you'd said something to the effect of, you know, looking inside our brains and figuring out if there is an it there, what that it is, you know, and that sort of is something that I think about, because so much of our self is constructed in, in ways that we are obviously, like not aware of ourselves. And it's so contingent. Like I remember when one of my favourite musicians, Chris Cornell died, you know, I didn't this piece because I was I was pretty sort of disturbed by the manner of the death in the sense that he had been feeling low, and he had taken medication for that. And the medication is known apparently to make people suicidal. And so the chemical composition of his brain just changed slightly and, and he died. And everything becomes so contingent. I think there was a study on mass shooters, which showed that, you know, a significant number of them actually, you know, either had a tumour in the brain, or they had some issue going physically wrong, which made them behave differently, which means you become just a completely different human being, you know, there's that old story, I think, from the 19th century of a guy called Phineas Gage, an iron rod went through a part of his brain and just changed him completely. And made him a different person. And so, like, do you sort of look at yourself and think about how much of yourself is constructed and contingent and how fragile it is, because just the act of getting older, if your memory starts to go, everything could change. If you, you know, if there are chemical imbalances, everything could change, you skip breakfast and lunch, you're a different person in the evening, you're snapping at everybody. And you know, that's obviously a temporary change, but deeper changes do happen. And you know, in your episode with me, you'd also, at one point, spoken about religiosity. And I was wondering that, can religiosity be an act of intentionality? Like I chatted with a guest recently who said that, you know, when she was young, she decided, I will be happy. She made happiness an act of intentionality, figured out what she needs to do. And she willed herself into happiness. Similarly, I can see it as an act of reason, as it were to will yourself into religiosity. Because in this world, in a tragic cast, we perhaps need a delusion to survive and why not choose our delusion? You know, maybe those of us who are atheist are choosing a different kind of delusion, which is equally futile, and perhaps less effective. So, you know, when you sort of look at yourself, how like, and this is something that I sometimes wonder that people look at me in a certain way, but is it all a pretense? Am I posturing to myself in being who I am, in a sense? You know, when you sort of look at yourself, like, is this stuff that you've thought about with regard to yourself? Gosh,"

        "message": "I guess you thought about probably, yes. It doesn't have anything particularly insightful to say on it. Probably no, but let's try anything. Let's, you know, be good to draw you out as well. So, again, separating out two or three different questions. So, one, I think, you know, this question of, in a sense, I think the physicality and the determinism of ourselves, right? And clearly, from a scientific point of view, that's the presumption with which science, in a sense, looks at the self. And I think the Kantian answer is still the right one, that as human beings, we can't but look at ourselves from both perspectives, both as creatures who are determined, but also who act as if we aren't. I mean, there's, you know, it's two sides of the same coin in some ways, right? But I'd be a little bit cautious, I think, about this physical thing. One, because the science is just not that developed. I mean, in that sense, the science of the psyche has kind of eluded us. And in fact, excessive fate in scientism about the psyche has produced all kinds of adverse consequences. You know, and I think one manifestation of that, for example, is, you know, think of, for example, opioid addictions. Think of, in some senses, the over-medicalization, right? Now, I mean, I'd be the last person to say that, you know, mental health isn't a serious issue. And God knows the societies, we don't take it seriously. But there are legitimate questions to be asked about the over-medicalization in some senses of it, right? There is also a conception of our own lives. And as a liberal, I'm actually a little bit puzzled by this. I mean, just to provoke you maybe in your, you know, listeners a little bit, which is, it's a conversation I used to have with students in college. So it's, you know, which is that liberals above all prize their autonomy, or whatever this illusion of autonomy that we have, let's call it that, right? But it is certainly an affect and a felt experience that you prize. And yet, there is a far greater valorization of giving over yourself to experience and substances, whose core is actually the erosion of your autonomy. I think drinking, for example, is why I mean, and this, particularly in India, this strange conflation that kind of to be a liberal has to be that cultural effect that you've exercised that choice. I mean, it's just bizarre to me, actually, that as a liberal, you should be asking the question, what is it that actually impairs your autonomy, right? And to the extent that forms of medicalization can actually also do that. I think it's something that we need to sort of discuss. I'm not competent as a scientist to discuss it. But I think the ideology of scientism about the psyche, I am a little bit suspicious of, even though I think there are specific interventions that are necessary, right? The second part of, you know, I think your question in some senses, which is the religiosity question, right? Now, I actually believe with Wittgenstein in some ways, I mean, he had this remark somewhere that, you know, I would write that I'm writing to the glory of God. But I can't say that because this remark would be misunderstood. And what he meant by that was, I think, exactly right, which is that under contemporary conditions, there is actually no way of articulating the meaning or idea of religion, that in some senses will not be misunderstood, right. There's three tropes we commonly use for it. So one is simply group identity. It's the form in which we produce a communal identification for that. And in that sense, it can be a substitute for nationalism. It has psychological functions, but at its base, it's not religious, it really is. And it's not religious precisely because of its vicariousness, right? There's a kind of inauthenticity to it. When you say, you know, the first thing I see you that you're a Hindu, it's not clear. I mean, to me, that's like the most irreligious response you could get, right? The second trope is this kind of OPM of the masses, this compensation for a kind of life of suffering, delusion. And to me, that kind of is a little bit beside the point. One, because it I think it goes back to the point, right, which is that under conditions where we actually don't know, right? What kind of knowledge reason can give us to actually make sense of this world? I think it's a little bit hubristic to say that this is a kind of delusion in some sense, I mean, compared to what, right? I mean, in some, I mean, no doubt, a lot of it is motivated by suffering. No doubt, a lot of it is a kind of psychological recompense, right? But that can also be a perfectly rational decision in some sense is not right. The third trope in a way about religion is as a kind of subjective preference, right? It's what people do, I choose this. Now, to me, neither of those three things actually go at the heart of what any properly religious question is about. In any, frankly, I mean, I'll be a little presumptuous here to say, but I think in any religious tradition, right? Because ultimately, the question from which religion began, right, was what is the ultimate nature of reality and what is the form of consciousness through which we comprehend it? I mean, that's the quest, right? Now, you can go different ways in it, you know, is revelation necessary, is grace necessary, is whatever, right? But the core of religion, in a sense, is the attainment of exactly that kind of hyper self-consciousness, right? That actually, you know, the Enlightenment was, I think, aspiring to. Where religion might differ is what might be the instruments of attaining that space, right? And it's not an accident that I think all serious religious practitioners in some ways, right? It comes with a set of practices. And the set of practices open you up to forms of knowledge. And those forms of knowledge have to be in principle intersubjective in some senses, even mystical states. I mean, anybody who's talked about them, right, from Plotinus to Iqbal, to Aurobindo, take any tradition, right? Okay. But I mean, it won't come at will in some senses, like there is a whole protocol of in some senses how you actually get to it. Now, one of the things that I think makes the modern religious logic incoherent in some senses, right, is that we have that superficial language of religion without, in some senses, the cultural understanding of any of those underlying practices that actually made it a plausible enterprise in the first place, right? The second aspect of a religious attitude in some ways, one is this kind of self-consciousness. The second, when to me the most important element of a religious attitude is the complete position of trust about the world. And in that sense, many secular people can be deeply religious. I mean, you talked about a kind of presumptive good faith, right? But in a way, that is the core of a kind of religious sensibility, that I may not understand a lot of things, God knows we are finite and limited, we don't. But there is a kind of presumptive goodness and beauty about this world, even in the face of all the kind of horrors and catastrophes, right? At least that presumption is the basis which we live. In that sense, I think a religion that inculcates a hermeneutics of suspicion, to my mind, is fundamental. That's to me the antithesis of anything religious. Because it is a way of saying, right, that I don't trust the structure of being or whatever this is. I have to take it into my own hands to in some senses fix this, right, or whatever. I mean, I think that, you know, that story that's been used many times in the context of free speech, but God is Kali saying to Vivekananda, you know, is it your job to protect me or mine to protect you? I mean, it's an act of trust in some, right? So the second thing is, I think, trust. The third, I think, is that religion in some senses is a sensibility to the whole of life, which comes from, as I said, if you align the quest for hyper self-consciousness, a very, very difficult path, with a presumptive trust, then that's something that actually permeates all the activities you do. It's not something you do like from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and then, you know, come out of the world in some sense, right? Now, it's not an accident that I think the one thing every religion enjoys, again, the cost of simplification, is there's a great suspicion in every religion of the concept of the I, the ego, you know, whether it's ahankar, whether it's arrogance. And there's an epistemological reason for it, right? Because if you ask the question, what closes us off to forms of knowledge? One simple answer will be, it's the intrusion of our own desires and seeing ourselves as the center through which everything is reflected. Right? I mean, the minute your ego comes into play, all knowledge bets are off, right? At a collective level, where you have collective narcissism, even more the case, right? So, to me, all of these three attributes are incredibly difficult to achieve. These are not something you can, you know, turn off at will. I mean, this is, you know, and some would argue you need grace to do it. We can leave that open, whether there is such a thing as grace. But this combination of a quest for hyper self-consciousness, a presumptive trust in the order of being, and that's the trust that then becomes a source of sustenance and joy in some ways, right? There's a kind of joyous orientation to the world, and a dissolution of ego. To me, that's the religious sensibility. Everything else, to me, seems just like an analog of, you know, anything we could consume, you know, buy off the supermarket in some ways."

        "message": "You know, circle back to one part of the question that I'd asked, which is, you know, about the construction of the self. I read this excellent book by Luke Burgess called Wanting, in which he speaks about the influence of Ren\u00e9 Girard on him. And Ren\u00e9 Girard, of course, came up with the concept of mimetic desire, which is that so many of the things that we want, we want because others want them, they're not intrinsic to us. And from that, I learned the frame of thick and thin desires, you know, thin desires being mimetic desires. So I want a Mercedes or, you know, a young person today may say, I want to get married and have kids, but there's no intrinsic reason or thought that's gone behind it. They're mimetic and they're thin. And a thicker desire would be, you know, something that is part of you in a different context, in a different place, you would still sort of want that. And I think that's also a frame in a sense to think about the self. Because then, I think it would at least be easy to talk about thin desires and be able to then disentangle that part of the self from, you know, what is superficial and thin, as opposed to what is, you know, more intrinsic, if anything is intrinsic. And obviously, there is a contradiction that many of our thin desires can be deeply intense. And you know, in a society like ours can even drive us to violence, for example. And many of our thick desires can be dormant, latent, sort of hiding behind. Like I have been reflecting on this recently and realised that many of the things I wanted were perhaps in desires, I wasted too much time and emotional energy, just wanting those things. And I'm also beginning to understand what my thick desires are, though it could be the case that I could be rationalising them as thick and they're really thin as well. If you were to turn that lens on yourself, you know, what would you say, were your thick desires, were you always aware of them? You know, what were your thin desires, so to say?"

        "message": "No, look, I think the thick desire at one level, it's a pretty easy story, which is a certain kind of pleasure in familiar relationships, whether it's family or friends. And I think I consider myself lucky enough, never sort of thought that that was something that either remain unfulfilled in different ways. I mean, and that, in a sense, gives your world a kind of concreteness in some ways, right? Probably also provides a sense of reassurance and security and a sense of joy. But other than that, the only thick desire was actually, you know, can I live in a world where somebody can actually pay me to just read lots and lots of books? I mean, and I'm not saying that just kind of flippantly. I think in a sense, that was, you know, I think the core of kind of what keeps you grounded in some ways. But I think to broaden your question, and I think, you know, in some sense, take the more serious part of your question seriously. There's a reason I'm a little bit wary of the thick thin distinction. Again, for the following reason, which is a lot of the thin desires or desires that we in retrospect think, you know, we're worthless, you know, we have regret about. They often spring from something that is actually worthy and deep. So to go back to Gerard's point about mimetic desire, and he was right, right, in some senses, the worst form of vicarious living all of us live. And that's something capitalism does try on, is this sense that our desires need to be shaped by A, what other people are doing, and B, what other people think of us in some ways. That's a kind of abstraction, right? That's a kind of, again, a form of vicariousness. But you can be a little bit more sympathetic to that also. You can say that, look, underlying it is, we do want some basic affirmation of our dignity, right? That I'm a being that in some senses, is at least recognized as a source of value in themselves. And I think Rousseau's response to Gerard would be exactly right, which is to say that, look, this mimetic desire is a pathological expression of something that is deep inside us, that is morally legitimate, but that society is not giving us. How else in a society that is racked by inequality, do actually people come to be noticed by other people, right? Material possessions have always worked at the level of the psyche, it's never been about the materialism in some ways, right? Okay. So, yes, you could argue in principle, this Mercedes is completely worthless to me, it has no intrinsic good, the better opportunity cost uses of my capital. But boss, it's the only time 10 people actually look at whatever, you know, some version of that story, right? And I think the insight I think in Rousseau's I think articulation was that, and that's linked to the argument about reciprocity inequality, that unless you have a measure of reciprocity in society, you will never be able to sift through what your own thick desires are. Because your thick and thin will get conflated this way. It's not just that, you know, you want these superficial trinkets. It just is that, you know, you do want some affirmation of your dignity. And this is the only way the society kind of affords it, right? So, one, I think I'm just a little bit kind of wary about what the counterfactual test is of hitting the thick and thin, you know, I think distinction in some ways. And one of the projects that has animated the modern world, and I guess that's why you do public service by, you know, furthering a public conversation, that's why many people write, is to at least hold on to some awareness of this part of the modern project. That this idea that we can find our authentic desires without some kind of social transformation, that may actually be a delusion. And I think, I mean, you know, to use a name not fashionable these days, but I think Marx was right on this. That unless you have conditions of freedom and liberation, you actually don't know what is authentically yours, right? Because even the good stuff will be satiated only through, you know, in some sense, you know, this form. I think that's one. But the other thing I'll add to this, you know, it's not so much a question of desires. I mean, I think the real challenge in life is we all have abilities, dispositions, and temperaments. And the hardest part is, in a sense, matching the desire to your abilities, dispositions, and temperaments. I tend to like a sedate lifestyle. I mean, it's just sort of, it's just, you know, and maybe it just comes from, you know, thinking that, you know, being able to read books is the epitome of a kind of good life, right? But there is a kind of temperamental story about this. And the one thing I have to say, I think, in talking to students, in particular, one thing I kind of discovered over the years was that they're incredibly smart about the world. I mean, God knows, right? They know pretty much everything. What they haven't thought about often is a kind of examination of their own temperaments. You made certain choices based on your temperament. I mean, if you like mastery over your time, you will like only certain kinds of jobs, right? That's a temperamental thing, right? In some senses. There's some people who simply do not respond to structure and order well, right? And I think the question, at least in a worldly sense, to me, is not the question of desire. It's actually the question of, do you know your temperament well enough to be able to then kind of, because that provides a good filter, it kind of leaves out a lot of desires that might otherwise make you unhappy."

        "message": "So I want to go back earlier to something you said about how we arrive at a moral point of view through collective engagement and discourse and all of that. And I'm struck by the term a moral point of view. And I would question whether they can be something like an objective moral point of view at all. Like, here's, you know, one argument that has recently come up and it would not have been an argument 20 years ago or 30 years ago, which is about artificial general intelligence, right? And, you know, there's artificial special intelligence, which is things like where computers do certain things much better than us already, but they're specialised like calculators or GPS or whatever. And the argument is at some point, if AI reaches a certain kind of consciousness or an analogue of it, and achieves artificial general intelligence, then it will immediately be far better than us in every possible domain, because all the specialised functions are already there. Now, this leads to the ethical question of what if say in a thought experiment, an AI consciousness we create comes up and says that, hey, why should I be your tool? You know, I have everything that you have, in terms of I am way smarter, I have consciousness, I have all of this, and I'm not mortal like you. So why should I not be worthy of your moral consideration as an equal? Or why should I not be your superior? Because I have so many things you don't. And this, I think, leads to the question about, you know, where are sort of in that hierarchy of things that are worthy of moral consideration, how it's a form of speciesism that we only consider ourselves sort of worthy of that, because our only difference between us and this hypothetical AGI hypothetical and inevitable being that emerges is that, you know, we are wet machines, as it were, we are organic, we will eventually perish. And it sort of speaks to how our notions of morality are so constrained by what we are as a species and how we see ourselves and our hubris. I, you know, went to college in Ferguson College, Pune, and one of our legendary teachers from the 19th century, a man who died young was a gentleman named Gopal Ganesh Agarkar. And Agarkar once taught a biology class in Ferguson College, perhaps circa 1892-1893, where at one point, he asked his biology students that if donkeys had a gourd, what would that gourd look like? And then he lifted his hands above his ears, you know, but and perhaps it would be blasphemous for someone to do that in today's environment. But, you know, when we speak of when we use a phrase like a moral point of view, for example, or how we arrive at a sort of morality, how do you think about that? Because, like one, obviously, it's, in a sense, a social construct, we arrive at it through dialogue, norms form over time. Sometimes those norms get embedded in institutions like religions, and so on and so forth. But, you know, isn't it something really nebulous? Isn't just a notion of there being morality? Isn't that itself a kind of delusion, a necessary delusion, but a delusion nevertheless?"

        "message": "Well, once you say it's a necessary delusion, it becomes a more complicated thing, right? I mean, because that, you know, necessity can have its own. Again, let me kind of separate out two different questions. One was the very powerful question about speciesism, which I think is really, I think, you know, interesting question, and particularly one that humanity has to confront at this point. And the second question about the moral point of view, right? So one way of thinking about the moral point of view is not to jump to the conclusion, right? What is morality? What's the content? You know, is relativism true? All of that. It is to ask the question, what is necessary, right? What is it without which our lives become unintelligible to ourselves? And that thing can be as real as anything else, right? So it could be a very simple thing, which is, you know, somebody hits you, you feel a form of resentment. And the nature of that resentment is not understood only by the fact that this guy has more power than you. You actually want to say I was wronged here, right? Going back to the discussion of dignity in some senses, right? When a society mutilates individuals, right? In some senses, we all, or at least those people who are the receiving end of it, there's a sense that their very being, their value is being violated. In a way that's actually quite different from, let's say, you know, why is the stone here and not here, right? I mean, that's it. So, to me, there is no account that I have seen of human beings, including AI, biologists, one, whatever. I mean, there can be explanations of it. But none of them have got us to the point where they can say, we become intelligible to ourselves without invoking some notion like this, right? I mean, that's in a sense, the starting point of this conversation, right? So, and I actually don't think, I mean, again, this is not my domain, and I have to confess a certain inability to understand a lot of the arguments. But I don't think there is anything in the AI literature that actually takes away from this problem of in some senses, meaning and intelligibility, which is the question of value. In fact, it's interesting, you know, there's a line in the Mahabharata against the Shantipur, which actually, when it asks the question, what is humanity? It actually says it is to take the moral point of view. But in this sense, I mean, it's not a particular morality, which is we will just be unintelligible, without some notion of right, wrong, you know, now, whether it's a moral aesthetic notion, we can debate, but that elemental sense is a condition of our intelligibility. And that I don't think is going anywhere. I mean, I right. Now, the next step in some senses in that thing, right, and that's really what I think the Enlightenment worried about. That's what serious modelists about is that, how do you take something that is latent, that is a kind of condition of our intelligibility, right? And, you know, even the most monstrous claim they are doing something for the good, quote, unquote, right? I mean, you know, there's this kind of big debate in literature. I mean, I think Faust, Mephisto is, I think, the only character one can think of where a writer has tried. Can you imagine somebody who is totally immune to any form of moral thinking? Literally, I mean, just, you know, now, the project then is to say, okay, how do we take something that's latent, and in a sense, draw out its inner logic. And that's where some of the universalizability argument comes, right? I mean, again, this is 101, very basic. If you feel wrong, when somebody hits you, it's because you place value on yourself, you think something of value is being violated. But if that value is to be objective value, not just you saying it, right, and it is important to yourself that you are objectively valuable, right? Not just because I said, because then I said, I mean, why do I care, right? That anything that in some senses is similarly situated, right? Because that's what it means to be an objective value, right? That the thing that makes it valuable, in a sense, exists independently of merely the fact that you say it, right? So I actually don't see anything in the kind of science and you know, these projects have been around since these fantasies around the 19th century that actually get away from the fact that some thinking about more or at least a moral language, we would be unintelligible to ourselves without that. I mean, it's you might say it's part of our being self conscious. Now, there's a second question, which I think was is really difficult, which is the species, which is one way in which this model point of view has gone, is to basically give our species a particular kind of privilege, right? And that privilege has taken extreme forms, it has taken the form of saying every other species is a mere instrument to us, in some senses, that's the radical exploitation of nature. Although historically, there's always been a debate on it. And the second mistake that has come from that speciesism is to say that the reason we are uniquely valuable is because we have this thing called consciousness morality. Now, the second thing to me, I think all the evidence is not just from modern science, but this is an old argument, you can take Jain scriptures, you can take Montaigne's, you know, famous account, Apology for Raven Siobhan. This idea that we are uniquely rational, uniquely moral is just false. I mean, it's just even as an empirical description, right? I actually think Professor Agarkar's question was, in a sense, a good one, in some senses, you know, what does actually the moral life, if you want to call it the conscious life of in some senses, donkey actually look like, I mean, what things and there is probably some positing going on there. But it is the case that neither can they access ours, nor can we quite access theirs in the same way, right? Now, the move that I personally am comfortable blocking is the move that says that just because we have attributed consciousness to ourselves, and then we made the mistake of saying, in order to be objectively valuable, you have to be conscious in the way in which we are conscious, right? To me, that doesn't follow, right? And that, I think, opens up an argument about what our relationship with other species should be in some ways, right? Now, on the AI side of it, so, you and I are probably old enough to remember the, you're slightly younger, the, you know, the Star Tech next generation. Remember, there's this fantastic episode, where they're about to dismantle data, this kind of humanoid Android, and data then raises this question, even though I was constructed by you as a machine, am I still property, right? And his argument is that he's reached a level of consciousness that you know, and it's actually a fascinating episode. It's actually, you know, wonderful for kind of classes and stuff. Now, when you see a question like that, right, suppose this AI figure comes up and says, look, I become conscious. There can be two kinds of responses. One might go actually the way of saying that we'll have to have a much clearer conception of what that consciousness involves. There's one level of that consciousness, which I think is what a lot of CS people talk about, which is a form of reflexivity, right? There's learning, as it were, right, which is a form of consciousness. But is it the kind of consciousness in some senses that we attribute to ourselves, which involves the question of morality and value as centrally constituted of what it means to be a conscious creature, right? So, there's going to be a debate about that in some ways, right? And I do have, you know, I've heard people have been very eminent computer scientists who say that actually, even on the most ambitious person of general AI, you're not actually going to get there. But let's say for argument's sake you do. I mean, you know, let's say for argument's sake you do. I think then we'd have to consider the possibility. I mean, after all, we could also, ourselves, be actually precisely those kinds of AI creations and not know it. I mean, that's, you know, the philosopher David Chalmers has a recent book arguing in some sense is just that. But, you know, the Yog Vasistha has this nice line, right, that in some senses, we are actually enacted in somebody else's dream. I mean, not even in some ways there, right? So, I think we should be open to the possibility, at least conceptually, it doesn't seem to be, to be off to say that if such beings were to come into existence, then our whole conception of what the nature of this cosmos is, would be so kind of put out of sync, that many of these limitations we place on who we give rights to, who we don't, you know, probably will come into question."

So, you know, before we go into the break, a final question and again, out of about morality itself, like the question that I've kind of thought about a lot, and perhaps my answer is still not as formed as I would like, is how should we live our lives? Right? What is the moral code that we follow? You've spoken when you've spoken about Adam Smith earlier that, you know, that take out the priests and the warriors and you know, when we talk about universal values, what Smith does is he doesn't ask what are universal values, he asks what are human traits, and that sense of empathy, that sense of reciprocity, then comes into play. Exactly what you said earlier that if somebody hits me, I perceive that I have been hurt, I also realised that I could hit somebody and they could be hurt and from that, I arrive at whatever my way of living is. And I would say that in our personal lives, most of us and I think we discussed this in the last episode, in our personal lives, most of us are liberal or libertarian or whatever, in the sense that we respect the consent of others and whatever. But, you know, this is surely a question that you've sort of thought about the question of how should I live my life? What is good? What is bad? What is moral? You know, which comes into play in not just, you know, all our personal relationships as well, because typically what happens is that, especially in a place like India, there are templates for all of these things. This is what a husband and a wife are, this is what a father and a son are, or so on and so forth from either side of the equation. And thinking about this stuff for yourself can make you re examine what is wrong with those templates and all of that. So what have been your thoughts on?"

        "message": "Well, I'm not going to use the word delusion. I think break it down into three different compartments, right? So one is, again, a very elemental sociological fact that you live in a society and you need forms of social cooperation, even make your individual flourishing possible. And what are the norms appropriate to that form of social cooperation, right? That allows each of us to live with enough dignity and freedom. And that's the basic, I think, liberal question. And you don't have to get deeply metaphysical about it. Where does that come from? That can actually, it can be a mixture in some senses of one just recognizing won't it be attractive to live in a society where not everybody around you, you're not threatened by everybody around you. And one condition of making them unthreatening, making us unthreatening to each other is to, again, acknowledge a certain kind of equality and reciprocity, right? So I think the public morality part, I mean, not particularly original, but I think that part, I think liberalism did get, I think, broadly right, that, you know, for the most part, it's the best way. The second part, I think, has to do in some ways with when you say living morally is, you know, in part, the moral dilemmas we face are provided by the forms of life that we inhabit. Now, some of these forms of life are familiar that can be oppressive, right? But the pathways you choose require those social forms of life to exist. Even you being a broadcaster requires an institution of this kind, right? Being an entrepreneur requires, in some senses, a whole social structure, property rights, whatever, right? Now, I think the tough question is, what are those forms of life that, again, constrain us in ways that actually fundamentally violate our value? Problem with oppressive tradition is not that it's tradition, not that it's oppressive. The problem is that mostly when it's oppressive, it's, again, denying you agency and reciprocity, right? That's what patriarchy does. It says women are not agents in any respect, right? But the uncomfortable truth is that that stuff doesn't just apply to traditional institutions. Many would argue that can also apply to the modern economy, right? I mean, again, the idea of treating labor as a commodity, right? Where there'll be large numbers of people whose choices are determined by the reign of necessity, right? And your relationship to them is governed by that reign of necessity, right? By the way, that reign of necessity applies to capital as well. You know, when we all say, under this system, I have to do this, right? So, critiquing forms of life, that's actually a much harder task. It's easier to critique them in the abstract. But that goes back to the point we started with, which is how do you actually reconfigure some of those things where the ethical dilemmas that come from participating in forms of life that are actually intrinsically violating something you hold important, right? And again, to go back to William James, he was right. He said the only way we deal with it is often by being partially blind, right? We will have the Taj Mahal, but we'll shut out the labor behind it in some ways, right? Maybe the world is tragic enough that you have to kind of, in some senses, keep doing it. But I think the critique of forms of life, I think, is an interesting question that older liberals used to ask in some ways. Another example, I think, of that, which I think is particularly important at this point, you know, if you look at the 19th century debate on freedom, this was a point of consensus across the board, whether it was socialists, Marxists, liberals. You cannot be truly free unless you have control over your time, which is there's a large part of your life that is governed by purposes that you set for yourself, not because you have to, or it's a, right? It's a promise on which actually a lot of modern society has failed, right? And from Mill to Keynes, there was this liberal fantasy, look, technology should enable all of this, right? But somehow, we've not been able to come up with social arrangements, right? Where that very core idea of an autonomous self, the self that is actually controlling time and setting to purposes that are authentically your own, your thick desires, not just necessity, not just thin desire, right? So I think one needs to think about how we subject institutions to that kind of critique. I actually think the capitalism argument, I think on the efficiency desire argument, you know, it's so kind of optimized that argument, that all of these questions of value, right? To, you know, use the title of Milton Friedman's book, Capitalism and Freedom, where is the freedom part in this? Right? I think that's a much harder question, I think, to think about, because even if you can conceptually think about it, it's not actually clear what forms of collective action, you know, accomplish that, and particularly given the tragedies of the 20th century history, what has been done in the name of that kind of freedom, you know, I think puts us all in I think, I think, in a sense, a bit of quandary. The third and I think, final thing, which I mean, going back to I think, the religious sensibility, which I think, I think is some level part of aesthetics, as well, which is that you have to find sources of joy in the world. And that joy can, I think, my own view is, I think, it's hard to find it without some conception of objective value behind it. Right? It's true, we are transient creatures, right? It's not, it's not important whether, you know, we live or survive tomorrow. But what is important, right? And what gives an enduring sense of joy, or why do we go on? Is the sense that there are some things that are actually worth striving for, you know, it could be creating a great podcast, it could be creating, you know, great forms of music in some ways, right? I think opening yourself up to that, that there is objective value. I think total cynicism about value can bring a certain kind of clarity about how you operate in this world. I'm very sceptical that it can bring you joy in the long run."

And the most fundamental source of joy is neurons in your brain firing together in a particular way. And, and I interpret that as happiness, it makes me feel good, it could be, you know, maybe I eat something nice, or I see something pretty or, or whatever it is. Now, you could have a thought experiment where we are like in a matrix like world, or we are, you know, in a machine where you have electrodes going inside our head, I think Nozick also had a similar thought experiment. And, and we could be happy forever. And like, if, like, when I pose a question to myself, that would that be a good, like, what is objectionable about that if everyone could just be strapped up to this machine, and they live their entire lives feeling joy, feeling happiness, feeling whatever, what is the problem? And my answer to that is a problem is that I am denying the agency of all these people that I'm taking away their autonomy. But the question that is harder to answer is that, why am I placing a value on this autonomy? Right? And I could sort of waffle around and I could say things like, you know, that their existence is meaningless if they don't have that autonomy, and so on. But then a further why emerges? Why? You know, so what's if I if I can put that to you, what's your answer? And by the way, my philosophy towards life now is exactly what you said that I try to look for small things that make me happy, you know, so I've realized that the key to happiness is being mindful in the present moment and taking joy in what you have around you. But just as a provocation, it's a question that I sort of struggle with that to me that autonomy, that agency is everything, but why?"

It's not just kind of agents. I mean, it's, it's, it's, there's no you there to be happy. I mean, I think I think I think on the logic of that, if you want to take it actually, one step further, and it's related to the agency point, right? It's, it's, it's actually a kind of perverse reversal of the Buddhist view that look, it's just a series of momentary sensations. There is actually nothing else, except this, you know, but who's the you that is experiencing it? Who's the you that actually gives meaning to even the term pleasure in some ways, right? So, to me, I think, if that were a possibility, or at least, we recognize that as a possibility, pretty much everything else about us would become unintelligible, right? So, I actually think this is not just in the realm of hypotheticals. I think it's a realm where you can, you can complicate the question very many different ways, right? Why are we even using the term happiness? Would this kind of being, right, I mean, kids born, you know, there's like, you know, would the kid be able to say I'm happy? I mean, that's, that's, that's an artifact of a certain kind of society that's created language, agency, and all of that stuff, right? So, I actually think that will be such a kind of radical transformation of the structure of the cosmos that, yes, I mean, I've no problem conceding, right, that if such a situation would come to pass, then our whole world would break down, but it would break down to the point where actually even the question becomes unintelligible, right? Oh, Amit, would you like to live your life hooked up to a machine? There's no Amit here anymore. There's no conception of pleasure here anymore, right? At least pleasure is, in a sense, we understood it, understand it as a kind of conceptual category, right? So, I, that's, I think, my take on that, that it's not just that it will actually destroy my agency, right, is it actually destroys pretty much everything, any form of intelligibility that we know.

I recognized that one day that could happen to me if I live long enough, inevitably, and you know, humility, therefore, demands that we are skeptical of this notion of you.

I mean, I think the fundamental component of good life is a kind of reflectiveness. And reflectiveness is different from having rules and formulas. I mean, liberals can often be very unreflective when they act simply on rules and formulas. But the condition of reflectiveness, particularly when thinking about the I right, and, and, and this even religions would argue for the dissolution of the I will concede, right? Is you have to look at where people are sitting, and what is the vantage point? Right? Yes, you and I may dissolve tomorrow, our memories fade, our sense of self or even our sense of our own past fail, right? But we were implicated in a community, right? Friends, relatives, children, right spouses. They have given a narrative arc to our I, to our I, right in some sense. And that's one context of an I in some ways, right? There's an I in relation to the state where which is what you're talking about liberalism, which is that for those purposes, we are a kind of ontological unit that has dignity and value in our own right in, you know, in some ways, right? There's the biological conception of I, right, where there's, you might say, the transmutation of our physical body and our neurons, right? And our peculiar dignity is precisely that there is a kind of value in all of these. So even those who talk about the dissolution of the self, right? I mean, in some senses, that's the point at which you have no embodied existence whatsoever. And, you know, most religions, this kind of talk about rising about your ego, but moksha and nirvana are actually not very seriously propagated, right? Because in some senses, they are actually uninteresting, right? It's that the I is actually produced in the context of these different locations. And it's actually having a clarity about that, right? And negotiating these tensions, that actually produces a higher form of, you know, you might say selflessness in some ways, right? I mean, you know, the sense that, oh, okay, yes, I have no I can also be a kind of act of narcissism in some senses, right? I mean, even if that is true, the fact is, you are a causal agent in this world right now. When you move your arm, the air moves. If you say something, it has effects, right? It's true that that doesn't mean you will have a stable I over time. But it does mean that your ability to create an effect in this world, right, requires a certain attribution of responsibility to you. So, there's a, you know, there's a construction of I in the context of an attribution of responsibility. So, I would actually say that I agree with you that, you know, there isn't a kind of stable essential thing called an I, right? But I don't think it actually follows from that, that there aren't uses of that, which are again, inescapable uses. I mean, the reason in philosophical context, the term necessity is important, because it's not just delusion. I mean, it's delusion only if you have a sense that, look, the only things that are real are material in some ways. It's necessity in the sense that it's the condition of intelligibility in some ways. And then the paradox that is often said, right, you know, it's Derek Parfit writes an article saying the self does not exist. And you want to say, well, who is Derek Parfit? Right? I mean, now I'm being a little bit flippant, and there's a good philosophical answer to that question, right? But in that sense, reflection and context matters."

And I have also been thinking of late about how so many people aren't given to self reflection at all, they just live their lives along whatever grooves they happen to be on, and they don't think much about it. Now, recently, something happened in my life, which I think was fairly life changing, in the sense that all these years I've had this intellectual curiosity to find out about the world, but I had no idea what was going on in my own body, or so on and so forth. But a friend of mine, Ajay Shah, the economist recommended I get a continuous glucose monitor, a CGM, I kind of did that, alarmed by what I saw changed my habits and my lifestyle entirely because of that in terms of what I eat, how much I exercise all of that. And I think that's great. And I want to sort of cultivate that further. And that got me to thinking about, okay, I have gotten a CGM for the body. But what about a CGM for the self or a CGM for the soul if one is to, you know, articulate that grandly, or a self reflection machine, so to say. And the question I want to ask you is, how can, in your view, just and I'm thinking aloud here, how does one cultivate self reflection?

So one, I, you know, I actually don't think it's a question of some people are not reflective, I think, pretty much all of us are not reflective in some areas of our lives. I mean, I think I think the interesting question is where we end up being reflective and not, I mean, it's a, it's a line that kind of, and again, part of it is actually understandable for good reason. I mean, you know, which is that, if you think reason under determines choice and value, right? You think knowledge is always partial. And we are finite beings. Then the consequence of being a fully reflective being all the time would be actually disable every kind of action. I remember the discussion in some senses, we were having the forms of life, right? And the forms of life often provide a closure. I mean, look, if I have to run an institution, if I have to run a factory, if I have to feed kids, under the circumstances that our society provides for us, I have no option but to bring a certain kind of closure to my reflection, right? So I think there's that that's one kind of a constraint, right? And so we can kind of all fall into our grooves. I mean, what's the point of me thinking about something that is outside of the horizon of possibility in some ways, right? We let a few privileged thinkers do it, society creates a risk investment pool, you know, you guys, you know, sit and think up these experiments. So I think that's what I think this is the second reason why we close off reflection, which is has to do with I think, a point you had made earlier, which is, you know, it is actually often practice that gives us meaning, right? So it's not easy to answer the question, why are you doing this rather than that? I mean, you know, you can say it gives me meaning, but could I actually, you know, explain in fully, you know, rational optimisation terms, why I should be doing podcasts rather than doing something else? Answer is no, right? So I would not be too hard, I think, in some ways. And I actually agree with Bernard Williams's kind of takedown of Socrates, you know, that all saying that a non-reflective life is not worth living. And I actually think that's false. I mean, I do think you can live incredibly worthwhile lives and not actually be reflective in that kind of broad sense. So I don't worry about the problem of reflection in general. I mean, it's, you know, where I think it probably matters most is, I think, in our political relations to others, where because you're counting on their cooperation, they are yours, right? It's just hard to imagine coming up with just terms of social cooperation that does not involve at least a minimal kind of reflection, let me listen to what they're saying, right? What is the other side of this argument? How do I give this person who's been totally excluded, standing in some ways? And to me, I think the most interesting instigators of reflection, so there's the personal stuff, right? All of us go through a phase in life where we are not paying attention to our bodies, and there'll be some external shock that induces us. But often the most important instigator of reflection, one that matters morally, is where one somebody challenges you, even in a familial context, right? And to give up on reflection, then is to basically then say, look, I think only force can settle this argument, right? So I worry about reaching a point where, you know, we are committed to saying, look, only force can settle this argument. That's the sense in which reflection is important. But, you know, should you all the time be reflecting on everything you do? I'm actually not sold on that proposition."

At one level, I mean, you know, if you were a serious philosopher, you would say, actually, this is not an example of reflection as much as prudence, right? That in a way, most of us live our lives prudently, and that this happens in a particular context of life, right? This form of prudence becomes important, right? Take care of your health. I think with reflection, I'm not sure there's a metric, but I think there are two or three features that you've seen. One is, I think, in hyper awareness of the conditionality of everything you're saying. I mean, the social science version of this is under what conditions. And to lead a reflective life in part a kind of self-awareness of the conditionality of anything. So it's not saying, look, you know, this commitment is bad, because I've kind of taken a decision and closed off reflection of it. It's just being aware of the conditions under which you actually took a particular decision, right? And often, the most reflective people, I think, are playful in that sense. They are constantly, in some senses, thinking of that conditionality. That's the opposite of dogmatism as well. That sense of conditionality also opens you up to the world, because the reflection has to be a reflection about the world. I mean, it's not just a kind of right. And if you already have a sensibility that is not open to the conditionality of everything, right, you're pretty much closing yourself off to the world. So I would say I think that to me is often a good sign, where when people present arguments, or when they think about why they give certain beliefs authority, they can actually articulate and are aware of actually the conditionality of those claims and stuff. That's probably as good a metric as any of"

An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction. In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150 and is a monthly thing.

Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Pratap Bhanu Mehta about many things including the nebulousness of the self before the break. So you could argue that you know, who are the people who are talking if the self is so nebulous? I want to ask you a question about the world and try to understand it better. And I mean, these are confusing times, we touched on this at the start of the episode, that many of our assumptions about the world, especially the assumption of progress are being challenged. And I see two broad trends playing out in the world, which seem to be going in different directions. And one is the spread of populism and authoritarianism, and illiberalism, and so on and so forth. And the other is a sort of empowerment of individuals by technology, something that you disparagingly referred to as tech solutionism. But in general, as a trend, technology enabling individuals enabling components of liberal liberalism, which, you know, failed in certain political ways, but tech is achieving that. And there, what is happening also, as a consequence of that is in many different domains, a crumbling of mainstreams, like we see it in media where the mainstream is gone in the 90s, you there was a mainstream media, you had a consensus on the truth that's dissipated. And in a sense, it's a net positive, everyone has a means of production in their hands. And that is empowering for individuals. But the mainstream is gone, I see that in the creative economy. And I sometimes speculate about whether that is happening in terms of nation states itself, where, you know, the internet makes us all global citizens able to form communities of choice, we are no longer constrained by circumstance or geography. And, you know, one of these trends is centralizing and narrowing. And the other of these trends is sort of a broadening of, you know, not just our scope and potential, but also a broadening of our imagination. And I don't know how to reconcile the two. And apart from this very nebulous sense of, okay, these two really separate things are happening and one is bad, and the other is mostly good. Beyond that, I haven't thought about it with much rigor. So give me a sense of, you know, what's really happening in the"

        "message": "world? What's the story of the last 10 years? You ask the kinds of questions only God can answer. We can speculate, we can speculate. So again, I think I would separate out your two questions, both because, and I think you hinted at it, which is not that one is broadly good and one other bad, which is both of them have, I think, a certain kind of internal tension and contradiction, right? So let's start with the illiberalism story first. And with your permission, let's take a step back from this current moment again, just to try and see, you know, what's contingent about a moment and what's kind of enduring here. If you look at the sources of illiberalism in the modern world, right, you can create a long list, but there are three that I think are politically quite salient. One which we have talked a lot about, so I won't dwell on it here, which is, in a sense, nationalism, right? I mean, most arguments for abridging individual liberty in our context have some connection to nationalism, national security, even religious arguments, even arguments over blasphemy, even arguments over offence to religion, is because religion has been ethnicised into a collective identity, right? And historically, we don't have an answer to this question that nationalism, you know, both enables a modern democracy, but also puts individual liberties at risk. And I don't think that's actually distinctive, I think it, you know, waxes and wanes in some ways. And, you know, the era where there was a kind of uncommit, you know, an unapologetic commitment to liberalism in the face of nationalism has been actually very, very rare. You know, even in the US, we can talk about now, but when you look at Jim Crow, when you look at McCarthyism, actually, even if you look at American free speech jurisprudence in the late 1950s, early 60s, it's actually not that liberal once you come down to it. So I think on that, one can, all one can say is, look, this is a aporia at the heart of our politics, we can't do without nations and yet can't live with them. But there's a second perspective and just, you know, just to sort of broaden the debate a bit. You know, you began with Fukuyama, and when Fukuyama talked about the end of history, again, this is an oversimplification of the argument. But broadly, the argument was that, look, there's a big 20th century battle between, in some senses, communism and some combination of liberal democracy and capitalism and liberal democracy and capitalism one, broadly speaking. And that combination is a relatively stable combination. It's not the most exalted. It doesn't cater to the highest greatness we are capable for. But it does satisfy our thymos in some senses, our kind of spiritedness, it sublimates it in some ways. I think what's happening in the world right now, I configure the modern ideological landscape slightly differently. It's not, it's actually compatible with Fukuyama's, but a slightly different way of thinking about it. That if you look at, you know, 20th century political history and the history of ideas, which is something you're, you know, deeply interested in, two things strike you quite remarkably, right? One is the endurance and persistence of certain political forms and ways of thinking, right? So, at one level, it's quite remarkable that, you know, American debates are still talking about 1776, right? I mean, it's just talk of the conditionality of the world. It just seems like a very, very different world. But here's this document constructed in 1776, around which so many debates have been configured. You think of China, almost 100 years of the party state as a political form, right? You think of West Asia, right? And by West Asia, I'm using broadly, but basically Pakistan to Egypt, right? There's this question that is set off in the late 19th, early 20th century, which is, is there a modern form of Islamic constitutionalism possible that can both acknowledge the sovereignty of God, and yet be a modern constitution, right? And you look at Africa, right, which, in some senses, the modern African political theory project was, never again do we want a world which is divided by the colour line and the colour line becomes the basis of exploitation, right? And India is in this kind of odd place where, in this respect, it actually ends up being part of, in a sense, that liberal capitalist domain where we basically come to the conclusion that creating a broadly liberal constitution with a democracy in a kind of unlikely place, in fact, the arguments are even stronger in a place like India, because this is the only thing that can in some ways keep the peace, at least that was the argument. Now, what strikes me about the world at the moment is there's an exhaustion around all of these projects. And by exhaustion, I mean, three things specifically. One, the sense amongst people that, as currently conceived, these projects are not delivering what they promised, there is a kind of crisis of legitimacy, it can be actually very mundane. I mean, if you ask me about the US right now, and you say, you know, what is the biggest failure of liberals? I don't think it's an ideological failure. It's that liberals have to demonstrate that they can govern. Why do liberal states have the worst homeless crisis in America? Why do they have the worst opioid crisis in America, right? Why is American infrastructure so terrible, right? So, there is a sense in which those foundational questions are no longer translating into the kinds of governance expectations that people naturally assume. Increasingly, this is going to be true of China and has been for a while, right? To me, the sign that a state has to resort to more repression, and more closure and more surveillance is often a tacit admission that it has an internal legitimacy crisis. The party state that China perfected was a extraordinary 20th century political form. In fact, I think it's a more important distinction than the communism, capitalism one, right? Where you said, look, we'll organize a political society around a political party that is different from political parties in the West. It's not a party of interest. It's not a party of principle. It's a party that is both a vanguard. So, it projects into the future. It says, these are the principal contradictions society needs solving, party is the instrument to do it. All conflicts are mediated through the party. And the party is representative because the party comes to stand in the nation, for the nation in some ways, right? Now, the fact that China is having to resort to more repression, more surveillance, that modest optimism we had under Deng times, not that China would become a liberal democracy, I don't think that was ever on the cards, and maybe for good reason, right? But a sense that there could be a party state form that could cohabit with other political forms, and be relatively more open, right? That's facing, in a sense, an internal crisis of legitimacy. Liberal democracies facing an internal crisis of legitimacy, as I said, one, it's governance credentials. And look, fundamentally, even now in India, right? Yes, communalism is important. But at the heart of the matter is finding political parties and people who look like they can lead and govern, right? And the dilemma for centrists and liberals is that they look terrible on that score, at least to most of the people. Now, whether it's right or wrong, we can debate, but you know, that's the sheen that the Congress Party lost. It was never great. But now, the re's almost a sense you can't even govern your own party, how you're going to govern the country, right? West Asia, right? In some senses, the central contradiction in that project, which is running from Pakistan to Egypt, right? Is the answer to that question of can you have an Islamic state under the sovereignty of God, you can have one that is relatively decent, you can have one that is progressive in some ways. But can it allow for the kinds of freedoms that a modern world is premised on, including, most importantly, the freedom of thought and expression? That's turning out to be a misnomer, right? And this was the illusion of, you know, even the most enlightened thinkers like Iqbal, or very sophisticated thinkers like Maududi, right? That you kind of create these modern Islamic states. So, that project has been in crisis for a while. And again, there are many reasons for that crisis, geopolitics, imperialism, rantier states, it's not just an ideological crisis. The African project, in some senses, right? That if you, at one level, you could argue that if you're interested in racism and colour line, it's deeply entwined with the political power in geopolitics of the African continent, in some ways that if it gets its act together, right, the world system would look different in terms of how it divides, you know, how it thinks of in the sense of the race question. So, my sense is that I think what makes this moment if it's not that history ended, it's that there is a kind of internal exhaustion that the entire world is feeling. It's not that right now, China looks like a better competitor to liberal democracy, as much as the BJP might want to create elements of a party state, right? And then cutting through all of that is the simple fact that the answer to almost every legitimation crisis has been the creation or recreation of some form of nationalism. Because it's a form of solidarity that depends on identification, not on achievement. If you're creating a solidarity based on equality and reciprocity, you better show it. If you're creating a solidarity based on saying, you know, we produce 10% growth, there's enough goodies for everybody to go around, you better produce it. If you create solidarity based on saying we are the greatest country in the world, because we have the best infrastructure, we can provide housing for everyone, you better produce it. So, I think in that sense, there is a kind of, I think, a global kind of ideological exhaustion in these four major projects that actually were the fulcrum of politics in the 20th century in those regions. And as I said, the remarkable thing about is the stickiness, right? I mean, which is once that question becomes fundamental to politics, that way of framing a question, how it kind of endures, even in its kind of most pathological form sometimes, right? And all of this then is happening in the crisis, in the context of some larger social changes, as you in a sense indicate forms of communication, the tectonic shift of power to Asia, which gives a geopolitical edge to the question of nationalism, right? In a way, and I think, pretty much every regime from Putin to Xi Jinping, and arguably, India, maybe the US will also come around to it is against taking the national project around some form of global geopolitical presence. But except now, it's happening in circumstances that are extremely competitive. I mean, you know, and to that extent, you have to give, you know, I think, compliments to neoliberalism that it did lift millions of people out of poverty did actually change the balance of power, I think, in the world in which, you know, many people on the left do not actually acknowledge, right? For whatever it's, I think, other, you know, other faults. So you have the making of a perfect storm, internal ideological exhaustion in a condition where geopolitical competition can no longer be managed by any hegemonic power of any kind, right? I think to me, that is, I think, at the heart in some senses of illiberalism. I don't think it's a simple choice. Do people vote on their prejudices? Are they being communal? Or are they being, you know, voting instrumentally? I think the way people often think about politics is politics is always about concrete people and concrete political parties, right? What are your choices? And they come to some judgments about relative credibility. So it's actually quite possible that you might think X is a thorough rogue, but turns out to be, from your point of view, slightly lesser rogue than others, right? So, you know, and in that reservoir of credibility, I think liberals lost a lot of that argument. I don't think they lost that argument only because, you know, their parties were hijacked by wokeism. Frankly, I think wokeism is as much a kind of its impact is as much exaggerated by the right, because it's an ideal convenient ideological tool against which to define your identity. It's also a way of not confronting something that is at the core of wokeism everywhere, and not just US, which is the question of equality, right? I mean, it's become a kind of, you know, sometimes a way of evading that question, right? But it also has to do with concrete structures of governance. Now, it could be I mean, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act has passed in the US, it could be that this is a turning point, that, but a lot will depend on what happens in the real economy over the next, you know, year, two years, three years, it could be a demonstration that the US can again do large projects that, you know, it now doesn't, it's actually worse than India, in some ways, it takes four years to fix an escalator in the New York subway. It could be a way of demonstrating that the administrative state that the liberals created is not an obstacle to actually creating these kinds of projects that people share in. But good leaders, in a sense, build their reservoir across these domains. So I think with Narendra Modi, for example, I mean, I don't think it's just communalism. It's, he tries to build a reservoir in all kinds of ways, including sending you personalized letters for paying your taxes, and you know, doing all the nice things that you have done for the country amidst, you know, it's a way of gaining familiarity, right? Whether it's in some senses, it's the new welfarism. And I think the challenge for the center and the left is to actually demonstrate that kind of credibility, where we are hampered by the fact that we don't actually have a political party vehicle that can do that at the moment."

        "message": "So I'm fascinated by the term ideological exhaustion. And what that sort of makes me wonder is, was ideology ever so big in the first place? Was it ever a determining factor? Like when I look at India alone, which is the only country about which I think I can talk with lived experience, as it were, what I see essentially, is that for decades, it's the elites who had an ideology, which was this received idea of a secular and tolerant India and all of that. And I think, I'm not sure that was really shared by the masses. I think the way we drifted through the decades was partly because of inertia, partly because most people weren't empowered, and that empowerment started happening late. And, you know, and we've discussed this before my sense that our society always had these currents running through it, and that now politics has caught up with society, finally. So I'm wondering if there ever was any ideological hold, or is that a story we like to tell ourselves? Like, I think, you know, when we explain the world, it's essential to tell ourselves stories, it is inevitable that they will both be simple and simplistic. And I wonder if privileging ideology as a convenient way to explain political currents everywhere, somehow is such a small part of the story that it's, you know, that it misses."

        "message": "You've actually answered your own question in two different ways. I mean, right, which is, you're, of course, right, that, you know, this is not a kind of explanation, right, in a sense, right? I think the point about ideological exhaustion, right, was in some senses, to say that, when you have, in a way, this kind of triple crisis, where whatever is the dominant narrative of your society, right, that basic structure that was taught to govern it, is not seen to be delivering the goods, right? That's, in a sense, condition number one. Condition number two, when new problems arise, to which that ideology does not seem fit for purpose, right? And that's part of the problem with the nation state thing. It's not fit for purpose for individual liberty, but it's not fit for purpose for actually solving planetary problems right now. I mean, you know, competitive nationalism is not going to be good for the planet in some ways, right? So, there's a kind of, right? And the third, in a sense, is a kind of more psychological one, where there isn't the articulation of any political party, vehicle, entity, that you have some presumptive credibility, that has some presumptive credibility or you have faith in, right? Now, I agree with you. I mean, you know, it's very hard to argue that India was secular, although I don't think it's an elite mass thing, because I think a lot of modern attacks on secularism are actually elite attacks, including amongst intellectuals, by the way. And ordinary people can often accommodate a vernacular secularism in practice, I think, much more effectively. But what you did have for good or for ill, right, is you, because of the history of the national movement, you had a leadership in a political party that carried enough reservoirs of credibility. When people voted for Jawaharlal Nehru, I don't think they voted by saying, you know, is Nehru secular or not? I think broadly, it was, yeah, looks like somebody who's generally competent and has the best interest of the country at the heart. And then, you know, a lot of the political culture changes around that, right? So you, in a sense, have an exhaustion of all of those elements, which no longer. And it's precisely under those circumstances, that partly nationalism is just tempting. Because it's the one easy identification narrative that you can actually produce across large numbers of people without doing, and the world is such that it is actually giving you raw material for doing it, right? There's the global geopolitical context, you know, okay. So, the exhaustion point was to kind of understand how do we end up in a place where in a sense, we are so receptive to the idea of just kind of smashing up a lot of stuff, which sustained us, right? The second point about ideology, and where I may differ with you slightly is, I'm actually stuck by the stickiness of the question. So it's not so much the, you know, which is, when you think of Indian debates, right, it's now 75 years since independence. And even now with the BJP, I mean, it might change, as if Hindu nationalism consolidates its power. There's a kind of basic frame within which we have the debate. And a lot of the debate is really about the effectiveness of that frame, whether it's implemented consistently the hypocrisies that attend to that story. When you think about the US, right, again, it's thinking within a horizon of very entrenched institutions, right? When you think of the party state in China, again, the state party has gone internal transformation. But it seems outside of the horizon of possibility, that there's a big voice saying, you know, boss, now let's have we have to think outside the horizon of the party state as we understood, right? I mean, the one thing that's announced in China is kind of competitive elections, right? Pakistan, right, or Egypt in some ways, where you say, yes, Islam is important. It's, you know, it's in some sense, it's a kind of extraordinary civilization. But has the time come to think outside of the horizon of a conception that is institutionalized in the state, and has to protect, you know, people against blasphemy or something, right? I mean, that's the no no question in some senses, right? Okay. So in that sense, I don't think it's specific ideological beliefs, it's that our framing of the question has already actually taken on board a certain conception of the horizons of possibility. And sometimes these are good things. I mean, you know, it's probably a good thing that, you know, liberal democracies are not yet thinking of converting themselves into party states. But you know, certainly the the Trump movement was a wake up call, that actually, in part, the response to that exhaustion is to say, actually, we need somebody who can smash this stuff open, even using the means that actually brought them to power to do it. So in that sense, I think ideology actually matters a lot. I mean, I think it's, in fact, we often don't recognize it, because it's actually so deeply embedded in the frames in which we are using, right, to pose the question, which will then circumscribe the range of answers you can give."

And one contention could be that both these ideas of India, as it were, to, you know, simplify and say that there are two, both these ideas of India are colonial ideas, and therefore unsustainable, in the sense that the modern Indian project, the political project of, you know, Sardar Patel and VP Menon, bringing all these princely states together, and so on, seems to me to be like a fast track colonization, what the British did over 200, 300 years, these guys did in a couple of years, and they did it through coercion, they did it through promises that were later broken. They did it in all kinds of ways, you know, under the notion that the end justifies the means and this is a glorious end. Now, the thing is, at one level, I can look at this nation state that we have today, and these lines on a map and India and I love this country deeply and I can celebrate our diversity and all the good things about us, as you know, JP Narayan once pointed out to me that it's okay to say we are an illiberal nation, but at the same time, we are liberal in so many lived ways, like the assimilation, which is reflected in our food, our languages, our clothes, everything. But is this unsustainable in the sense that in governance terms, I think everybody agrees that the more federal you are, the more local government is, the better it is for the people. My sense of the modern Indian state today is that it is a replica of the colonial state, except that our rulers today have brown skin instead of white skin. We are not really citizens, except in theory, we are subjects and they are rulers. And, and you know, when you look a little bit down the road, you see that big problem of delimitation also coming up, which is bound to for understandable reasons, raise a lot of shackles. And I think that, you know, whether or not we think outside the box, the box will think outside of itself, in the sense that look, there is a sense of permanence about this, but this nation has existed for 75 years, there might even be a sense of permanence about China's one party state, but the sample size of history through which it has, you know, survived this one party state, it's not necessary that it lasts much longer, everything in the present moment seems made of rock, but it withers away in a day.

Precisely because of that, it has to, in some senses, disembed everything that resists us quite powerfully. So, all states are kind of statist in that way.

Where there will always be this dialectic of the state, in a sense, wanting to create a particular form of order, and society resisting it, right? And in some senses, almost every historical comparative political literature, turns out, basically, centers on the proposition, what is the balance of the state and society? China, the quip went was all state, no civil society. India had a kind of light state, at least in terms of its ambition, and now it's kind of transforming into modern. You just can't get industrialization, you can't get the kind of labor mobility, all of that stuff without that state. So, in that sense, the process of state formation, I think is always going to be fraught in this kind of way. And I think the arguments about centralization and decentralization are always tactical arguments, in light of what the purpose of that state is. I think from a democratic point of view, and from the point of view of the delivery of certain kinds of services, I can agree with you, India is way too centralized. But frankly, there's no straightforward story. I mean, if you look at the literature on education, for example, right, it actually turns out, authoritarian states were far better than decentralized democratic states. The impulse to actually, you know, education often came from this extraneous purpose of building a state in nature, right? So, in that sense, I don't think India is an exception. And in India, because of the nature of social cleavages, this project has turned out differently in parts where we are successful at democratically incorporating it, as we have in some senses, right, with most states. Where we've tried repression, we usually fail, because I think there's enough kind of social resistance to it, right? So, it's not that in India, repression has kind of succeeded better than democracy. It's part of that same state society balance, whether it's democratic or not. Now, the question of the nation, I think, is a much more complicated one. And again, the cliche, all nation states are modern, the nation state form in which we understand it, which is horizontal conceptions of citizenship, equality, full membership, you know. Now, see, in India, there's a, there's a peculiar, I think, challenge. And I think we kind of under appreciate what the Nehru Sardar Patel project is. So, if you look at Europe, if you look at the map of Europe, the formation of nation states was accompanied by the bloodiest of exclusions. I mean, partly we don't see that because they accomplished that before they became nation states, 18th century, you can expel the Catholics, you can expel the Jews, you can do all kinds of things, right? Right. We forget Britain had an oath of allegiance till, you know, late 19th century, right? But even more startlingly, if you look at Michael Mann's work, The Dark Side of Democracy, the ethnic homogenization that went into the creation of nation states, because empires by their nature are kind of multilingual, but empires are not ambitious entities. So long as you're not challenging the ruler and giving decent enough taxes, they don't care, right? Which is why they can allow for your customs, they can allow for, you know, there's no modernizing project in most empires, most empires, some of them do. So, the project of the nation state, because it involves new conceptions of membership, new questions of who is the people. In a way, we don't actually have to answer that question politically before the 19th century. So, I think this debate was how far back Indian consciousness goes, Hindu consciousness goes, is actually beside the point. I mean, you can actually concede that it maybe goes far, there is actually a consciousness and I actually, I think academic scholarship is doing Indian history a disservice by this over determinism of kind of colonialism, right, as a kind of instigator for this conduct. But the specific form in which the question of nation is presented to us post 1857, now we are going to be a modern society. A modern society requires a different power sharing arrangement, right, than an empire does. If it's going to be a democracy, then that power sharing arrangement involves questions of majority and minority. And so, it's out of that crucible of representative democracy that actually our modern communal problem takes the turn it does. And the hard question for us is actually the intimate connection between this problem and the question of democratic representation, right? Particularly, once you start thinking in terms of majorities and minorities. Now, the simple solution would be, look, we are all individuals, right? That's in a sense, formally the American solution. But then you have to create the conditions to get there. Now, the second thing that I think Nehru and Patel grasp, right? So, and honestly, the question of representation and identity ended in failure with partition. India is born against the backdrop of the failure to resolve that question, which is fundamentally about a power sharing question, right? But Nehru and Patel, I think, also understood this thing about India, right? And when they looked at Europe, it's interesting, all Indian nationalists, right, including Nehru were not gung-ho about nationalism. I mean, Gandhi and Tagore are explicitly post-national thinkers in some ways. But even the Nehru's, even Aurobindo Ghosh actually kind of sees, you know, nationalism as kind of just a kind of transitory stage to something else. In part, because they saw the logic of the nation-state as homogenizing and exclusionary. For them, the beauty of the Indian experiment, right, is if you start breaking it up into 20 pieces, what you will get is the dynamic that 19th century Europe got, right? You can't object to a collective narcissism at a higher level, and then expect the smaller collective narcissism to, in some senses, be morally kosher, right? To the nature of cultural connections in India, right, in some senses, it's complicated braiding across caste, class in some ways, right, meant that any project of homogenization, right, at a local level, which is what, let's say, breaking up India into 10, 15, you know, 20 different states, which could sustain, would require, is it would require actually breaking people from their local identities and bonds in which we shouldn't assume that if Tamil Nadu is a state, I mean, the first thing that's going to happen is non-Tamil speakers will be kicked out. It happens pretty much everywhere. I mean, that's not right. So, they imagined India in a different way that instead of saying, you know, we're going to benchmark an Indian identity. And the answer to that benchmarking is lots of local benchmarks. Let these organic connections in some senses flow. What you need is an assurance that people's culture will not be trampled over. So, that's a linguistic compromise. India is unique in that kind of linguistic compromise, where you say 16 languages, you actually don't press the question of language in the way in which smaller states have never, think of tiny Sri Lanka, right? I mean, what a disaster, right? You know, it couldn't manage in some senses to communicate. So, the Nehru-Patel argument was counterintuitive. It says that let's use these cross-cutting diversities in some sense, in a way to imagine a new form of a nation state, which is actually not benchmarked. So, if you want to do a Hindu nationalist reading of our past, you're also welcome, in some senses, you know, if you think the Hindu nation was glorious, that's also fine. So long as we can agree on a kind of basic constitutional, I think, identity. We've seen this example in the Northeast, right? I mean, one of the interesting things about the Northeast and it's a place where the Indian state failed miserably, right? I mean, the amount of repression we used, right? But one of the interesting things about the Northeast is that there were, you know, a couple of insurgencies post-independence. But the minute we said, or moments in the Northeast said, we will align ethnicity and territoriality, you had like 20 insurgencies, because there's no way of aligning territoriality and ethnicity, right? Without literally pulling apart the society, even at the local level. So, I actually think, I think there's actually a much deeper sociological and practical understanding, I think, of why in some senses, you just have to think of India in this civilizational palimpsest terms, right? We tried one partition, I mean, you could argue that's one form of localism, right? Let's, right? It had the inevitable consequence of ethnic cleansing, right? So, this idea that you could break up India into small nation states, and that will somehow not raise this problem. So, Patel and Heru's answer and Gandhi's answer was, let's, you know, just go for the whole thing in some ways. The failure, I think, is the one you pointed to, which is that there are particular broken promises. There are parts of the country where we did not show enough faith in our own democracy in some ways. And so, whenever we tried democratic, you know, in the 50s, nobody gave India a chance, or at least many social scientists didn't. Whenever we tried democratic incorporation, we succeeded. And now, I think, you're right that there is an interesting question of what's the architecture of federalism that will continue in some senses to deepen that story. And there, I think we're going in the reverse direction. I mean, you know, there's a lot more centralization, and so forth. So, I think on this one, I'd give ourselves a little bit of credit. I don't think we were just aping colonial. What we were saying was, look, these are realities. There is a modern state, which is required under the modern horizons. And the only way in which you think you can make it work in the context of India's diversity, is to actually keep thinking of India in some senses as a whole, rather than saying, you know, we'll go the European way. Right. So, here's an innovation. I mean, it's the only nation state in the world that's still officially at least, right. And you could say that's a deficiency, does not push for everybody's language to be the same, not a classic attribute of nature. So, we actually innovated."

        "message": "Yeah, so, you know, before I kind of go further on that, just a minor lament that, you know, we talk about state versus society, and markets as a third prong, though, I think markets are just a mechanism for society to express itself through voluntary action. But otherwise, and people would expect that, okay, I always keep talking about the predatory state, surely, I'm on the side of society. But as an individual, I kind of have an issue with all of them, our state tends to be oppressive, our society tends to be illiberal, markets will generally be in thrall of one or the other, either you'll have cronyism, which are the opposite of free markets, and so on and so forth. But leaving that little lament about the importance that individuals deserve aside, I want to hark back to something that I think you mentioned in your in your conversation with Shruti, where you spoke about how nationalism is just one dimension of our problems, that the unresolved dilemma is how is power going to be shared once you institutionalize a democracy. And there, it seems that just thinking aloud on two fronts, we went terribly wrong. One is the first past the post system, proportional representation would have solved many of the problems and fissures that exist today, at least it would be less problematic. And the other, of course, is federalism, we centralized way too much, and we centralized for rational reasons, we centralized because at the time, we made these decisions, a country was falling apart, the center had to hold, so it was natural to want to centralize power. And, you know, Ambedkar, of course, was deeply suspicious and correctly so of smaller communities, you know, villages were a den of localism, and so on and so forth. And, you know, that was another rational reason to centralize power. The argument that you just articulated, you know, I haven't heard that before from any of those guys. So, can you elaborate a bit on this in terms of that problem? How is how is power going to be shared? And what is our experience with trying to solve for that problem? And what could resolve it going forward? So, I have a slight disagreement with you"

        "message": "on the first past the post system. So again, from a political science perspective, just like reason under determines choices, I think institutional design hugely under determines outcomes, usually, so I actually never buy these kind of and I think, I think there's a kind of lot of contextuality to it. And I'm actually not convinced that proportional representation is the answer to that problem, because proportional representation, because it depends on what you want to optimize on, right? So, if your images has five groups, we want to share, you know, 20% for you, 10% for you, 15% for you, proportional representation is fine, right? If you want to create a polity, right, where the aim of politics in some senses is to break the hold of those identities on you, that you see yourselves as part of these groups, right? Proportional representation can actually be quite a disaster, actually, in some ways. It can solidify the toxic, you know, and, and, and I think one of the interesting things about first past the post system normatively, which people under appreciate, right? Because I think we're, we're too mathematical about this. Politics is all about latent functions, not just manifest functions. So, you know, one of the original arguments for why have territorial based constituencies, right? I mean, that's itself is a, that's not clear, that's the only way to organize a democracy was supposed to be that territorial constituencies was a kind of proxy for a localized random selection. In any given territory, they'll be rich, they'll be poor. Hopefully, there'll be enough kind of caste diversity, religious diversity. And you want the unit to be one where you actually have to talk to everyone. So, so it's actually creating a process to the one of the unintended consequences of the first past the post system is, and again, it depends on context. Now, with party dominance changing, it will have a different meaning. We sometimes decry the fact that parties with small percentage of votes could actually hold up bills in Lok Sabha, you know, but there's a flip side to it. It's the system that allowed every party to share in national governance at some point, once that Congress hegemony is right. And what kept it together was not the formal design, what kept it was a certain understanding of politics. We have to talk to everyone here. A political self identity that politicians in some senses have that were fundamentally we are social mediators, at the fringes we engage in violence, but right. So, so whether it's first part of post system or proportional representation or presidential or parliamentary system, the actual work of politics and the forms of organization that happened outside the formal electoral process make a huge, huge difference. I mean, what what kept India together insofar as it was part of partition was not just, you know, that we had a constitution and design. It was a certain culture of the Congress Party. You know, you organize units regionally, you give language identity space, at least you make a show of inclusion, whatever, I mean, it had its limitations. Right. So, I think a lot of what changed in a sense was our kind of conception of politics, more than just design. I mean, I'm not saying that we shouldn't relook at the first part of the post system. But I think it's a bit quick to say, you know, it's like, if the state didn't work, market will. I mean, I think the underlying conditions in some senses are similar. So, then the question is, in a sense, what the question of power sharing is. Now, the problem with our pre-partition discussion on power sharing was we were all looking for an engineering solution, right? X representation, or if you give this community the veto on this issue. And I think Ambedkar called the bluff on that in his book on Pakistan. He says, boss, if you think of yourself as one nation, two societies, this is not going to be a power arrangement system between two communities that see themselves as part of the same nation. And the only way you're going to get that is in some senses, disembedding individuals, right? And his argument was that the strongest argument for partition is that it might give India the chance to modernize because it takes the Hindu-Muslim question off the agenda. He was not entirely sanguine about it, but he thought there was a much greater possibility of that than if you just locked India into this one question, what is going to be the balance of power between Hindus and Muslims. And unfortunately, I think since 1857, that political question has kind of dominated and the BJP now comes and says, we gave them a veto, we'll make them irrelevant, right? So, in that sense, that project, which was at the heart of Madisonian democracy, that you cannot make any system of representation run where fundamentally the purpose of representation is not to create a space for politics and individuality, but in some senses, to solidify identities. Now, you need to recognize identity sometimes, right? I mean, so the argument for, let's say, reservation for Dalits and Ambedkar is clear that the purpose of it is to give them the means and empower them to actually exercise their agency as individuals. It's not in some senses, just a mechanical, numerical, you know, question of power sharing. And the final question about power sharing is that ultimately, it's also about forms of social power, right? And one reason we worry about this particular moment is, you know, even if the state formally remains constitutional in the way that it is, and you know, you create forms of social power that stigmatize and marginalize and marginalize groups and target for them for being who they are, right? The Nehru project in some ways, right, actually kind of understood that. Now, the problem that happened in the sense that you don't actually have a vehicle, in some sense for achieving that objective. I think Gandhi was right on this. What happened to social reform? What happened to public education, the one crucible in which common citizenship is created around the world, right? That's pretty much been the most important instrument of any nation state, right? There, we, the liberals failed, absolutely, utterly, miserably. So, you're kind of operating on a project that has actually no institutional engines behind it."

And if you were to do it the other way around, you know, the argument could go the other way. And I'm convinced by your argument against proportional representation, that it embeds those identities in place and doesn't recognize the fact that every individual contains multitudes. And obviously, we want to move beyond identity. But then the same argument could also be used for various kinds of affirmative action that we've gone for, it could be used for, you know, what we did with the Hindu code bill, that you're treating people of one particular identity in one particular way, and, you know, privileging another one by leaving them out of it for understandable reasons that we don't want the minorities to feel uncomfortable, but nevertheless, and this is also a sort of a tension at the heart of the project, I think, in the sense that you have the constitution guaranteeing equality and that everyone will be treated equally. But then you have all of these exceptions carved out with perhaps great intentions, but you have these exceptions carved out. And in this sense, it seems a little incoherent, you know."

        "message": "So I think you have to distinguish the three cases that you mentioned, because I think they are very different logics. I mean, you know, to me, the reservation case, particularly for Dalits, right? What's the theory, right? The theory is, here's a group that is marginalized in on every single dimension, you can mention, right? Unlike OBCs and all, as you pointed out. And one instrument of addressing that marginalization has got to be giving a share in jobs and education. That's, that's, I mean, and partly just because of spinoff effects. I mean, because this is a group in some senses that was so marginalized, you've never seen a government officer, right? But the objective, right, is not the maintenance of a group identity, right? The objective is to put you in a position where you can actually exercise your individual agency like everybody else does. So when Dalits, you know, and it's not, I think, an accident that, you know, one of the reasons I think Dalits have been, Dalit movements have been such custodians of the constitution, not just because of the identification with Ambedkar. But because the story they want is not a story of, some now are beginning to articulate it after the Mandelson, but it's not a story of actually just power sharing and representation. It was a story of, in some sense, inclusion as agents and subjects, for which this happens to be an instrument, right? Now, there's two things that in a sense that so in principle, you can actually justify, I think, affirmative action of someone, right? The question then becomes, how do you design it in a way that actually achieves that particular objective, right? And there we, in a sense, did the kind of classic thing the Indian state does, lowest common denominator, simplest solution. And partly, we were politically wedded to it, because we were failing on all the other dimensions of inclusion, right? So this becomes a kind of lightning rod for mobilization. With the expansion of Mandal, in some senses, that inclusionary logic of affirmative action was now, OBCs are complicated groups, I mean, it's a very large category. But broadly speaking, it actually took the reservation debate into, here is a pie that needs to be divided, in a sense, according to the identities of people. And now we have the reductio ad absurdum of them, which is, you know, might as well say, you know, if they're only 5% of our castes, give them 5% or of that pie, right? And there were better ways of designing affirmative action. I think, you know, many people propose this. We were pushing for it at the Knowledge Commission based on Rakesh Basan's work then, which is, what if you used parents education as a proxy for people who are eligible for affirmative action, it would actually cover all the Dalit groups you need to cover, right? But in some senses, after a generation or two could be self-liquidating. Interestingly, JNU's multi-pronged deprivation index was actually an interesting way of breaking out of this mould, in some ways. And you could, you know, you could, you could actually tinker with it in ways in which so I actually think affirmative action is actually quite just but yes, the form in which we congealed it. And two, I think the cultural change, right, which is what happened the minute this became a question of just the sharing of power. The ethical dimension of it, which is the point is that in some senses, you should not be a prisoner of this compulsory identity, right? That ethical point got lost. And not just got lost. I mean, I was quite aghast, you know, day before yesterday, Manish Sodhia, you know, yes, the government is hounding him, but his first response was, I am a Rajput, I don't bow down. And I mean, I can understand the sentiment, but what's the implication, right? That there is a kind of compulsory identity of Rajputness. And you know, we slip into that quite, quite unconsciously, right? That the moral horror of caste, right, is that it gives everyone a compulsory identity where you have no control over your self-definition. Right? I mean, that's what makes, you know, parts of Manu like look so kind of oppressive. Why Ambedkar reacts so strongly to Gandhi, it's not just that Harijan is patronizing. It's the ultimate Manuwadi act where somebody comes and says, I'm going to name you, right? Right? No matter what you do, where you are, you're Harijan, right? And one of the reasons I think caste politics is so attractive to politicians, right? In a way in which class politics is not is because it provides a simple, simple metric, right? X people have graduated. If you do class, the minute you come out of your class, you're no longer a member of that class, right? So caste has this peculiar kind of feature, right? And why I think the caste census, I actually oppose the caste census, because I think everything that needs to be done for genuine empowerment, you can actually do without a census, you don't need a census for that. And it's an actually an artifact of this odd, and we haven't even resolved the methodological question, right? Can it be a part of self-definition? And if your identity cannot be part of self-definition, or not a product of self-definition, for the liberal state, that's almost the worst kind of identity, right? You don't even get the right to name who you are. Right? So I think that's where we ended up, I think, wrong with the caste question. The personal law question, in some ways, and you're right that the constitution did a compromise, it was a modus vivendi, it's conditions of partition. Partly, it's an act of reassurance, right, to minorities. The way I now think of the personal law question is, I think the question got slightly inframed in this terms of kind of uniform civil code. Because that, again, reinstates the question, whose civil code, who's defining it? Whose values get into it? And you know, when you're looking at things like marriage, right? I mean, I'm just trying to think of common civil code of, you know, marriage, cross cousin marriage, go through marriage, right? I mean, these are deeply met practices. The better tact to take, which I think is where the Supreme Court was incrementally heading, was to say that, look, there can be different kinds of variations, right? But all of those variations have to pass some basic tests, right? Gender equality, freedom of a certain kind, compatible with that, if the variation is fine, and plus, you can have an exit option. I mean, you can always do, you know, the special marriages act, right? But I think framing the common civil code around national integration was a mistake. Because it immediately raises the specter, will our cultural practices find a reflection in this nation? The commonality that we are interested in is the baseline consensus that the state has a compelling interest in gender equality and freedom across all laws, right? Compatible with that, if there are, you know, various kinds of variations and all of that, you know, that's something to be in a sense worked out. But the suspicion, right, that this is going to be drafted by a majority that's not going to consult others. And by the way, the reverse suspicion where Congress party's biggest mistake, to institutionally empower a body like the Muslim Personal Law Board, which is neither representative, nor farsighted, nor has any imagination, right? Partly, I think, for political reasons, the political reasons being that it was easier to prey on that politics of fear. The majority will, in some senses, ride roughshod over you. Now, that's happening anyway. But instead of being constructive about it, right, and Congress kind of betrayed all of these principles, particularly under Rajiv Gandhi. So I think that I think, I think for liberals, I think it's important to engage with the UCC debate, not just to a knee-jerk reaction, but bring it back to these first principles, right? What's the compelling core vision of the constitution that these practices in some senses have to and then, you know, then some senses apply that, I think, you know, symmetrically, you know, in some ways. I think on liberty, I actually agree with you where the two kinds of threats of liberty where, again, the Indian state not is not an exception. One is the kind of inflation of threats to national security and public order as pretext for containing curtailing civil rights, which again, all states have done. But the second, I am a near absolutist in free speech, unless there's direct incitement to violence. I think the presence of a category that looks like blasphemy, right, if it's an operational category in law, I mean, you have states like England, where it existed in the books, but you know, nobody bothered for it for quite a while, is actually a disaster for liberal societies. And it's a disaster in two ways. One, because it suggests the kind of basic lack of trust, which is the underlying discourse of that article, right? We are such mad people, we will get so triggered, right, that large scale violence is going to follow. But we fail to consider the reverse possibility that large scale violence, right, once you also follows from the fact that people can actually mobilize to get things banned, and then it becomes a competitive race between communities. So I think a very, very strong norm, right? And why, for instance, in the Nupur Sharma case, I think it was important to say that as a functionary of the BJP, right, the manner of articulation should not suggest that minorities are stigmatized and arguments about my mother weaponized in that way. But I actually don't think there's a case for arresting her. I think that's where, again, we liberals jump right into the trap. Right? So you reach a point where these kinds of utterances become a kind of matter of fact where, you know, somebody says, nobody actually pays attention to them. But by having a law, you are ensuring, right, that, you know, these get rid. By the way, this is not just true with this. I mean, you just look at what's happening in Punjab. I mean, Punjab has a blasphemy law, the SGPCs is cracked down in some senses of even legitimate scholars who work on Sikhism is actually a story that's not been written about enough. So there's all these kind of reverberating effects, Basaveshra's followers in Karnataka, right? So we just I think, I think we need to, in some senses, I think, show more trust. It's not going to be seamless. But we have locked ourselves into a vicious cycle, which is only, I think, deepened with every, again, you know, being stuck in a 1930s paradigm."

        "message": "No, but I think a couple of nuances I think on reservation for Dalits, I think I have a slightly different, it's not incompatible, but I think one nuance, you know, when we say solidified caste, I think we actually have to acknowledge the fact that a lot of that solidification actually comes from upper caste backlash that refuses to acknowledge this reality. Actually, it's not as much as if Dalits kind of, you know, yes, for political sense, but in some ways, I think, I actually do think there's a kind of asymmetry there, at least what I see on college campuses, in some ways, I mean, obviously, in India, you can't escape caste, but I think the solidification that has come from the resentment that I have to deal with this problem, I think that's actually, and it's a much more insidious form of solidification than a traditional and I think it has to be said that I think a lot of the mechanism of solidification, like in the US, in some senses, solidification of white identity actually comes from that. We don't want to share this power or innocence, share this space. I think the second thing, I think, in the case of Dalit reservations is that, you know, it has at the margins, I think, created avenues for mobility, which are beginning to have backchannel effects. I mean, you know, I think if our friend Chandraban was here, he has a particular take on this in some ways, right, which is that, in the case of Dalits, you urgently needed to create even the minimal resources, educational, to actually even think of the slightest forms of mobility, right. So, right. And you could argue that some of that has actually happened in some ways that, you know, in some senses, even the Dalit entrepreneurs that he's writing about, right. And many of them, by the way, don't want reservation for themselves and their kids. And there is, you know, so in that sense, I don't think for them, it's this kind of solidified story. But the fact that there were examples and the fact that this is, I think, an enabling step. I think the scandal, I think, of reservations is that, and this I can say, you know, very apparent when I was on the Knowledge Commission. Absolutely everybody in India gets mobilized on the issue of access, low fees, you know, affirmative action, impossible to get anybody mobilized on education quality. And access to us became that substitute for, you know, quality in some ways, right. And as time went on, so more and more weight was actually placed on the access story. You know, in that we are achieving quality is a kind of miracle, you know, in the sense that lots of little nooks and crannies allowed us escape all. But the quality story, and the quality story was, in fact, you know, often used against Dalits, right? I mean, this whole question of, you know, they're not enough qualified Dalits. I mean, frankly, in our context, if you're sincere about that, you first have to show what your record is on improving public schools, improving the quality of education. Otherwise, that's just a weapon to basically argue for the unfairness of reservation. I mean, it's, you know, pitting the plumage but forgetting the dying bird."

And in some senses, that's really an achievement, because it takes away from the hierarchical purity pollution aspects. It's a way of organizing group identity. I think the horror to my mind of that story, the way it has happened in India is, in a sense, the compulsory character of it. That the kinds of identities that liberal society values and values should valorize the freedom for people to, in some senses, choose and create identities. But the kind of identities that we have created, its compulsory character, right, which is, which is, in a sense, your measure, no matter it kind of all parts of the spectrum, right. And that now has even more insidious form, right? It's been given legal form in some ways, right?

It was almost a matter of faith at one point for our liberal elites that look, number one, we will, you know, create these top-down interventions to solve these problems. And number two, society will modernize over time, we'll get prosperous, things will get better, these fissures will disappear. Now, what we see with the anti-Muslim nature of modern politics, which more than one party subscribes to, is that that really hasn't happened. If anything, they've kind of deepened. We see the same thing with caste, we see more assertion of it, like, so somebody is standing up and saying he's a Rajput, and so on and so forth. You know, that's, if anything, it's, it's sort of become stronger. So where does progress then come from?"

        "message": "I mean, in the longer sweep, I think the story is a bit more mixed. And let me take one, begin with a different example, because it might have some bearing on actually these two as well, which is, you know, the one piece of good news that has come in the last week or so, which is India's India is inching back towards a normal sex ratio at birth, right? I know India's female labour force participation is abysmally low. But I actually think in 10 years, the story will be very different. I mean, I mean, you can almost sense the pressure of social change. You just look at any educational institution, you just look at that, you know, this kind of stuff, it's taking longer than it should. And often, you know, the lag between enrolment and participation is 15 to 10 to 15 years, partly because maybe people are investing in their children. So, so it's actually a good example, right? And one can be kind of cynical about it. But I actually saw in Haryana, you know, one of the most kind of patriarchal states in some ways, a kind of poster child. The beti bachao, beti padhao was not insincere across social and political spectrums. That doesn't mean violence is stopped. That doesn't mean honour killings are not going to happen. That doesn't mean you know, but so here's a kind of interesting example of actually a pretty deep and significant long term change that in some senses, I think, churning. Right. I think with caste, right. So you could tell a kind of benign story, which would go something like this, that again, what we are seeing at the moment is the lag between that political paradigm we had for the last 20-30 years and the actual social changes. So two things are already beginning, three things in the caste politics, right? One, the logic of caste now is de-agglomeration, right, which is already a kind of acknowledgement that that paradigm of classification didn't quite work. So now you have to have EBCs, now you have to add other criteria. So it's a kind of splintering of caste. Two, you're beginning to see a lot more splintering of voting choices, right? I mean, as much as you and I might hate Dalit groups voting for the BJP, at another level, it actually does signify something deep, right? Not just the fact that they think the BJP is not an obstacle, even if it's not, you know, fully empowering, but the identification between caste and party. Now, it still exists. I mean, you know, UP upper caste will predominantly 80% penetration of the BJP and stuff. But I actually think the voting story is a lot more fluid and will get fluid. And now again, it's endogenous. I mean, it's endogenous in the sense that if there's a plausible alternative coalition, people gravitate to it. If there's nothing on offer, then caste is a kind of default thing. I mean, if I know you're not, nobody's going to give me governance, I might as well get, you know, three of my buddies in government or something, right? And the shifting coalitions, in a sense around caste, right? So I think, I think that's, I think, I think a little bit in the sense of opening up. And the third thing, in a sense that that will happen, right, which is, you know, a lot of the articulation of the kind of liberal ideas, not the practice of liberalism, but ideas. It is historically required a kind of much bigger middle class, right? Now, up till now, most of us did not have to face this question, because other than in education institutions, because of reservation, we actually never actually had to encounter the question of sharing same spaces and all of that. And the fact that the focus is getting back on to things like discrimination and stuff, it may actually force a kind of different kind of conversation. Generationally, it may force a different kind of conversation, where you hope, I mean, let's see, does even politically, Tejasvi, do Tejasvi and Akhilesh, think of caste and politics somewhat differently, they're not going to give up on the caste story, right? But it's no longer that, you know, caste, dignity, or nothing else, program that Lalu ran on. So I actually think there are kind of exogenous changes. And I think on this Chandrabhan is right, this is the more economic churn you create, it opens up different possibilities. I'm not saying, I'm not an economic determinist, we know from the US experience, that, you know, categories like race and caste can be very, very sticky. But for years, you just didn't even have the basic raw material, to which to, in some senses, reconfigure all of this. So I suspect, you know, this is one place where you might get more progress. The Hindu Muslim thing, frankly, gives me the nightmares. It gives me the nightmares, because I see its normative entrenchment, like, so with caste, for all the, you know, social practices about caste, nobody kind of normatively defends, you know, we should return to caste society or something. Well, it's communalism, we do, I mean, that, you know, you can, so its normative entrenchment is much deeper. The kind of political narrative of fear that you need to sustain an anti-Muslim political outlook, that kind of material is very readily available. I mean, it takes one blasphemy incident. And, you know, we can talk about the short term victory of, you know, BJP having to expel three MLAs. Trust me, this is going to be an underground resentment, right? You have, in some sense, it's Pakistan, right? So, the objective conditions where Hindu nationalism creates a kind of climate of fear, magnifies what is actually not really as big a threat, right? Those conditions are actually more likely to obtain now in some ways, right? So, there's enough fodder for them, as it were, right? I think, in a way. Third thing in some ways, right, which is that, and this is where the question of power sharing with Muslims has always been complicated in the Indian context, that there's often a convergence between a certain kind of liberal and Hindu nationalism, right? I mean, Lala Lajpat Rai was actually as good a liberal as you can get in many respects, right? But the narrative of both, the construction of a Muslim otherness, where you say, look, there's something about this community that is going to make them more resistant to liberal norms than anybody else. Now, I actually don't believe that construction. I don't believe that construction. But the over determination of the ideological sources from which people come, I think, makes it a harder problem to deal with, which is why I think it's important for liberals to get their first principles right on this, you know, because the pseudo secularism charge, right, is something that we need to diffuse, I think, by our conduct. And unfortunately, as you rightly said, no political party is going to do it for us. I mean, that's the real danger part where you, for the first time since independence, you do not have a single political party that can, even on basic empathy grounds, say, in a civilized society, it's our job to make sure that nobody is targeted for being who they are. First time, no political, I actually, I'm even beginning to doubt whether TMC will do this"

I should point out to listeners that since you've referred to recent events, we will be recording this on August 24, it will come out a bit later. So, you know, just to keep that in mind, I did, by the way, invite Chandrabhan Prasad to the show during this trip. But the moment he heard I wanted five hours of his time, he was just very firm. He said, No, sir, please excuse leave me out of it. And I was like, it'd be fun. He's fun. If you can, I would really appreciate it. Because that's one episode I really, really want to do. But regardless of whether he comes on the show or not, I'd urge all my listeners to read his books and read his writing. A great thinker. And yeah, and you know, the thing to note about caste, which I keep thinking about and which I think elite discourse misses is that more Dalits voted for BJP in 2014 and 2019 than for any other party, you know, and and that's a revealed preference. So there's clearly something happening there, which is sort of interesting. But, you know, the anti Muslim stuff, it leaves me speechless. And what especially worries me is the inevitable consequence of what you wrote about as a BJP is long term strategy, which you termed heads weave and tails you lose. And the point there was that you do all this macho anti Muslim posturing, you're getting brownie points from your people. But the moment there is any backlash, you can use that to claim victimhood. And you can then, you know, double down on that. And that worries me enormously. It you know, so far, the Muslims of India and I hate to speak of anyone in a collective sense, but so far, the Muslims of India have been incredibly tolerant and graceful in the face of an incredible amount of provocation. But it just takes one random guy, breaking down not being able to do, you know, take it anymore and doing something rash. And then a video of that can just go all over WhatsApp. And you know, that can be the spark and you can light the fire. And that scares me a lot to the extent that that is not in anybody's control anymore. It is not as if the Prime Minister was to decide that this must not happen. Well, sorry, he doesn't control this anymore. He can't ride this tiger."

        "message": "So there's two things about that. I'll point slightly differently. That is actually the thing that gives me nightmares. I actually do think by the way, I still believe that when this Indian state wants to control stuff, it can, it actually can. I mean, it's, you know, which is why we've kind of, I mean, there's almost no right that doesn't happen without some kind of active state abdication or participation. I mean, it's not that it can kind of, you know, it can stop it from alter, but it can actually, you know, limit its impact and limit its scope, right. But the worrying thing is precisely that it doesn't look like the ruling dispensation will have an incentive to do that. That's one, or if it is an incentive, it will be a very tactical one for a particular context. But the second thing that's worrying me, right, and that's the larger context of our democracy, where, you know, this is also happening at a time where you both have a greater institutionalization of this kind of of this kind of communalism in different branches of the state as a very active state project. I mean, a kind of unconscious half-baked communalism is always part of the state, in some states more than others. But I'm less and less confident now that you can trust the key organs of the state where if the signal was right, they would actually do the right thing. I mean, I think in that sense, there's a kind of longer term, you know, whether it's judges, whether it's bureaucrats, possibly people even said they're just the armed forces, right? So, it gives you a very different kind of institutional power, right? That's, I think, one thing. The second thing, I think, is that, you know, given the way with which the government is going after the opposition now. So, if you ask the question about democracy, and as much as we decry professional politicians, every democracy is sustained by professional politicians. And by professional politicians, we mean a couple of things, a group of people who understand themselves to be members of a political class and acknowledge each other as members of a political class and play by a certain kind of certain rules of the game. Now, that can have its downsides. I mean, one of the downsides was, for example, you do not prosecute anybody in politics. We always used to say politicians get away scot-free. But in a way, that was part of that mutual reciprocity. If you look at the breakdown of democracies, once you have a hyper-ideological regime in power, and it has, in a sense, broken that professional norm, right? One should not assume that it will give up power easily, even if you think you can actually get it to lose in an election, right? Because you've already created this deep state apparatus, right? Which will allow, I mean, some will be opportunistic, some will shift. But surely, I think, given what India has gone through the last seven or eight years, it will allow the ruling establishment to do the same. If you were part of that establishment, you cannot now assume it's one IAS officer, another IAS officer, we just rotate like we used to, right? The kind of prosecution the ruling establishment would fear, if there's a genuine opposition victory, right? You could argue that that substantially reduces their investment in acquiescing to a peaceful transition of power. And I think this is a danger that we are facing for the first time in Indian democracy. And it's hard to kind of articulate it, because we haven't had a past kind of precedence. I mean, you could argue emergency 75. But all the signs are the ruling dispensation is putting itself in a position where it will be very difficult for its carders, its party, its leadership, to actually accept a peaceful transition of power. So you may be in a position where mere electoral dissatisfaction, unless it's like some massive thing that, you know, you kind of just really scare them. But even if it's a close election, we've already seen that in the US, right? I mean, the legitimacy of the election impugned. That's a very distinctive possibility in India now.

So there is a sense and, you know, I've seen traces of it in the rabbit holes, I've gone down on the extreme right wing rabbit holes, that the opposition will really come from within, like already we speak about the fault lines between Trads and Raitas as they are called, you know, Trads being the completely traditional hug back to good old Hinduism, whatever that was, and so on and so forth.

So this Trads and Raitas thing is a Twitter discourse, honestly, politically is useless. I think as a kind of articulation of a possible political movement, you know, somebody saying this is not traditional Hinduism, this is, you know, some violent, aggressive, non-traditional revolutionary doctrine, right? A, I don't think that's going to happen. B, I think it's a bit it's early days. Remember, yes, human nature is ambitious. But the BJP's had longer socialization mechanisms than I think almost, it's the kind of socialized message and mechanism that the Congress Party did, right? Where you could argue, I mean, look, do the counterfactual if Patel and Nehru had split, literally split. Or if Nehru had gone with Subash and split with Gandhi, an international movement could have collapsed. I actually still think if you look at the cast of characters, I mean, whatever their other faults, their ambitions will certainly come into play. But, and there will be differences. But I think it's too premature to conclude that this is just going to be another like factional fight. The third thing I think about that, which is there's just a speculative possibility, which is, suppose there were to be a split. Does the process of creating that split actually radicalize the party even more and make it worse? Because we know, I mean, this is often the case with extremist organizations, right? The way you claim your legitimacy is by outflanking whatever slivers of moderation you might have, right? That gives other parties an opening, but it doesn't necessarily actually mean that the outcome of that splintering is actually less violent or any good. And this is true of any religious base. I mean, you can look at the Akalis, you can look at, you know, that the splintering, because it'll have to legitimize itself.

I think that the way you stand out in your own party is by, you know, being purer than the purest. And to my mind, those horrific videos that emerged of that dharam sansad where you had a bunch of leaders. And to me, that was competitive, that was that was bound, they were all bound to be so extreme, because they were competing with each other. Had it been one guy on a stage, he might have said something a little less mad, you know, still would have been objectionable, but a little less mad, but they competed with each other. And the worry is that that kind of continues. And by the way, among the Republicans, Justin Amash did leave, but yeah, outlier who proves you know, the exception that proves the rule, I guess, in a sense, you know, I think I've held you long enough. So we can, you know, move away to more general questions, and then something more pleasant. And my big general question here is multifold, which is about engaging with reality, something that you've kind of referred to how in politics, the rules of the game have also sort of changed. And I look at different sort of ecosystems, and how they engage with reality. And one, I see the academic ecosystem, where I find that there is this massive academic circle jerk, where academics are talking to each other, and they are kind of trapped in that loop. And there are certain fashionable prisms which have to be adopted. Otherwise, you're not getting your papers published or not getting tenure. And more and more, I see the academic world, especially in the humanities, as something that is in a parallel universe and has lost all connection to the real world. And nobody takes him seriously and rightly so. I mean, individuals, of course, produce important work, but otherwise, then I look at politics, and politics also in India, politicians don't bother to engage with reality in that sense, because, you know, our politicians have figured out that narratives matter, governance doesn't. And in any case, their core skill when they get to power is building narratives, that's how they get to power. Governance is not necessarily a core skill, you can, you know, when you take over the state, you can let inertia continue, and so on and so forth. And there also engagement with reality is not so critical. You know, as far as the media is concerned, mainstream media is pretty much irrelevant, that we no longer have a consensus on the truth. It's narrative battles everywhere. As far as individuals are concerned, I think, you know, there is that famous quote from Kashi Kasi, where Kashi Nath Singh says, ki bhar mein jaye duniya, hum bhajaye harmoniya, right, which is, sometimes I feel that I should just adopt that and live by that. And I think many people, whatever they do, they, you know, they do despite the state, they're like, I got to get by how I got to get by, I don't really care. And plus, you know, rational ignorance kicks in, why waste time, when your one vote won't make so much of a difference. And the market engages with reality to the limited extent that, you know, you make money by fulfilling people's desires. So you want to know what they are, and so on and so forth. This then just becomes an issue that, you know, reality is not in question. And all of this, it's it's narrative games, narrative battles. You know, many great intellectuals are wasted in different ecosystems where they are of no consequence, like the academic world, for example. So what is your sense of all of this?

Now, but here, I think I would distinguish between two kinds of politicisation. So look, one, like with any organisation, there's a kind of institutional pathology, and particularly a lot of the stuff that you talked about, you know, building empires, patronage, creating particular paradigms. You know, these are actually all straightforward power grabs within the academia. They start off with good intention, but every paradigm wants to perpetuate itself, right? The second thing, I think, is, I think this argument about the political views of academics. And there, I actually think the story is a little bit more exaggerated, because you will, of course, expect academics to be at, in a sense, the frontier of, you know, and if you look at the kinds of things that people are objecting to, that academics are doing, particularly in the US, I think the bad faith of the objectors is as much clear as anything else. I mean, you know, I have my problems with critical race theory, but like anything, it had a kind of core insight, which you know, now you want to say, you know, you just can't even in some sense, right? There's a particular crisis specific to the humanities and disciplines like history. And I don't think that crisis is solvable. We used to manage the crisis by basically saying the political stakes in this should not be high. So let the 16, 19, 1776 project duke it out. Let Romila Thapar and Sitaram Goyal duke it out on medieval history, you know, we'll see that R.C. Majumdar, right? The problem, in a sense, is the insertion of a national identity in discourse that actually says our ground is that history. Now, once that happens, it both distorts the history and in a sense, the stakes, because you know, and I think to that extent, that has kind of changed. I mean, I think, I, you know, I'm feeling kind of nostalgic, JNU has a lot to answer for. I mean, JNU's, you know, academic practices were in some senses deeply exclusionary. But you know, in the 70s, right, the big exclusions were, you know, or 80s subaltern studies, and CPI historians are not genuine historians, it was not the right wing. I mean, it actually, you know, it's, you know, so I'd have colleagues would say Shahid Amin is not a real historian, you know, you're like scratching your head. I mean, you know, it's a so there was a certain kind of, I think, I think, pettiness and academic, I think, patronage story there. But I don't think the crisis of the history profession is going to be solved so long as you have a politics governed by nationalism. And unfortunately, I think history is also set it as a self of the problem, because most modern historiography was done in the service of the nation state in, you know, in, you know, in some ways. And so until we reach a point where the social contact is look, it doesn't matter, right, whether Babur demolished a mosque or not, at least not to the project that we want to salvage now, I don't think you're going to get through the crisis of history. And unfortunately, historians, because in a way, it increases their importance fall right into the trap. I mean, you know, they want to actually argue on those grounds. You just, you know, I mean, who knows if tomorrow, a new document is discovered, do we completely change the modern Indian project and it justifies, you know, so I think the crisis of history because of its close connection to the nation state, I think is a particular one. I think the crisis of disciplines like economics and stuff is, I think, much more methodological hubris in some ways, I think, again, forgetting the conditionality of your own, you know, own thinking. Politicians, I disagree with you a little bit. Even now, there's a fair degree of engagement with reality. I mean, the narrative part comes in, because that's a way of kind of coping with what this is. So when you can't build a coalition next, you build it on why, right? But there is still something about the culture of politics that actually forces. And even with the BJP government, I mean, you know, for the remarkable thing is, how it feels it needs to respond. You know, RSS farmers are upset, you know, it could be for purely tactical reasons, right? The sootboot ki sarkar jayi, I mean, a larger scheme of things seem like a little political triviality, but what it meant, in a sense, some senses to project. So I think with them, the issue is not that they're in touch with reality, it's whether they have the imagination and are willing to expend whatever political capital they have to actually, as you said, create those structures of governance, and in some areas they will and some areas they won't. I mean, I think the one I think thing we are interestingly missing, I think, about the Indian state, and I have a slight disagreement with my friend Karthik on this, where, you know, we've got used to this very simple narrative of the public as a failure, and the private as a kind of redemption. You know, for a lot of people, beginning with UPA1 is for the first time they're actually experiencing state capacity. I mean, think of infrastructure, for example, I mean, you know, we are a completely different page, right? Now, the surveillance things and stuff worries me, but the digital stuff is an expression of state capacity in some ways, right? And what we have been, in a sense, being able to do on scale, in lots of different ways, is that so I think it's a little bit unfair to say that what politicians are not doing our governance. So, in my senses, they're finite. I think every government in India now, every state government does two things well, because that's the ambit of its capability. That's right, it decides what to do. Arvind Kejriwal decided health and education. Many would argue about infrastructure in Delhi, right, whether the roads and stuff are. So, I actually think the politicians are actually quite capable of building out state capacity. I think what we did with, I think what we're doing with food distribution, right? I mean, for all the limitations, and there are exclusions, the debate on where PDS and the distribution of food now is very, very different from 20 years ago. Cash transfers, now you can agree or disagree with cash transfers, whether they're freebies or productives or not. But the fact that you can actually pull off what you're pulling off on scale. So, I think the politicians are actually interested in reality. I think their just conception of it, I think, differs a little bit slightly from ours. And I think the care, I think, which we have to take, you know, is that at the end of the day, but the public wants results, I think it's less interested in the public private thing. And most of the politicians, I think, of this generation have grasped the importance of state capacity. Now, they'll use it for nefarious ends. There are political constraints. I mean, if you want to centralise power, sometimes that can detract from a certain kind of state capacity. But, you know, I think we underestimate how much expansion of state capacity is actually happening in India, in some ways. I don't think that narrative, I mean, even of teacher absenteeism, actually, the government school thing has had ripple effects everywhere. I mean, look at the transfer system in Haryana now, right? This kind of semi automated system, which Arvind Kejriwal now wants to take to Gujarat, you know, everybody give your first preferences, they'll have an algorithm sorting out. Actually, it was quite a big deal. I mean, the hundreds of people used to line outside Chandigarh for transfers. I'm sure that the margin sum of that stuff is still happening. So I actually do think in that sense, politicians and what actually makes them dangerous is precisely that. I mean, if it were pure narrative, I think we just explored beyond the point. I mean, you know, you cannot fool all the people all the time, right? Is that I think they are actually much more attuned to this stuff than I think a lot of us academics are actually, in some ways. And they've figured out a social contract within their political imagination. Everybody's asking the question, you know, why isn't inflation generating more political resistance? Actually, maybe it's because compared to the 70s, because that's our benchmark, right? 80s and 70s. Maybe for certain sections, there's actually less volatility in basic access to food than was the case in the 70s and 80s. So yes, inflation is an issue, milk and vegetables and petrol prices are an issue. But it's not an issue in the same way that let's say flour and wheat might have been, you know, 25-30 years ago. So one of the reasons we always lose against politicians is they are actually more circumscribed by reality than we are. Yes, the media, the public sphere, absolutely. I mean, and it actually goes back to the fundamental problem, right, which is both the commercial incentives, if you are really in the world as you know, this example you gave that a certain kind of post will go viral and get you more revenue. And you are in a regulatory world where pretty much most of the media is now supply side media. I mean, I don't think Mr. Narani is going to make money off NDTV. That's not the point. Most channels don't make money, right? You actually have an architectural problem, which is, you know, what are the avenues through which voices get amplified? Now, having said that, I actually think in certain sections of the media, I think the Hindi press, certain parts of the Hindi press, which I read, I actually don't think it's a structural problem. These are genuine media houses, but they have become genuinely committed to this political project. I think they'll think of the Dharani Jagran, for example. You know that and it's a kind of indication of that institutionalization of, I don't think it's just because there's pressure. They are actually real believers in this stuff. Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of real"

Let's now talk about your reading habit, which I'm interested in. You said that the ideal kind of life for you is and your thick desire is that you're paid to read books. So tell me a little bit about what your reading habit is like. Is there an intentionality to your reading habit as well, that at some point you decided that there is a certain amount of reading you do? Also, when you read, you know, do you take notes? What do you do for, you know, assimilating the knowledge that you gather for knowledge management? And how big is writing a part of that assimilation process?"

        "message": "Oh, wow. You know, one should not overvalorize reading. I mean, it's something I enjoy. You know, there's that famous line of Hobbes, I don't know whether you've heard. So John Aubrey, who's this 17th century gossip, you know, and writes these wonderful brief lives of all the kind of big characters of 17th century. So he goes to Hobbes and says, you know, Mr. Hobbes, people don't think you're a real scholar. I mean, obviously, Hobbes's political views are controversial. Because you don't cite many people in your books, which gives them the impression that you actually haven't read a whole lot. And Hobbes replies, he said, if I had read as much as anyone else, I would have known only as much as anyone else. So I think you can, you know, I mean, I think you can valorize. But I'm addicted to reading in the sense that without a certain number of hours of it a day, it can vary. I mean, that obviously varies by responsibility and where you are. This is just almost the sense of, you know, when it's almost like an addiction in some ways. It's much less disciplined, I think. And particularly now, where I think the temptation to gain lots of superficial knowledge in lots of different fields, at least, even if you don't understand, you can say, okay, yes, this is the question that we're asking, I think is, is, is much, much greater. The notes and stuff is so, so anything that's in my core discipline, particularly political theory and philosophy, of course, is not just detailed notes, but in some senses, the act of responding by writing, not necessarily publishing, but at least you're kind of engaging with it, I think is, is hugely important. And I actually find teaching does the wonders for your reading, you actually read things differently when you have to teach it. Because you then have to really, in a sense, clarify the logical presentation in a way in which, you know, sometimes reading you can skip on. I used to do a lot of marginal notes, which partly because a larger proportion of the books are now in electronic format, I mean, just for access reasons. I mean, you can highlight and stuff, but I actually miss the dogmark books with all kinds of annotations. I think, you know, you know, I think across, across the board. I do find, as you get older, talking of the dissolving self, that the ability to retain structures and arguments, I think, still remains, but the memory about, like, detail and facts, I think I used to be better at it, right? I mean, and this is a gift often historians have, right? I think you find yourself struggling with a little bit more with that now. And maybe it's just a kind of, you know, process of aging, or at least I hope it's nothing more than that. And, you know, and, and, and it's interesting how the memory works in some ways that it's, if you can figure out the architectonic, it's easier to retain than, in a sense, trying to, you know, retain lots of details and narratives and facts. So I've, I've become less in command of stories, I think, then, then, then I kind of used to, even in the reading of fiction, I mean, you know, the broad outlines of the point, the plot, the affect, if it made you think, all that remains, but the kinds of things that you used to remember, which is, you know, lines from characters, textures of characters that I think, and maybe it's just, oh, Lord, I mean, it could be just just be that, you know, there's too much time on the screen. And so you're not processing it as as much."

And otherwise, it's in these, I actually, Western music, it'll be Western classical mostly, orchestral stuff. So it's, it's, I mean, it's not, it's not a very surprising to the usual suspects, Beethoven, Mozart, Handel, Mendelssohn. And actually, the one thing I would recommend, actually, for particularly people who are not used to East and Western classical, the Berlin Philharmonic, they started this under COVID, but they've actually put out a lot of this stuff online. And they also do like, these 10 minute things, right? So it's a larger performance. And obviously, you have to subscribe to pay access to the larger performance just digitally. But even the shorter things are truly kind of extraordinary, if you're kind of, you know, feeling so that that that's actually become the kind of, you know, you just look at the kind of Berlin Philharmonic's next release. But otherwise, and I think with classical now, interestingly, after going through a phase where I thought I had less patience, actually going back to longer compositions. Because one of the, I think, interesting things about, you know, Indian classical and talk of empowerment is the archive that is now publicly available. I mean, you know, we all grew up with Nikhil Banerjee, but the repertoire we'd heard was probably like 20 recordings. Now it's probably like 80, 100. And some of them are better than anything that was kind of published in his published in his lifetime, right? So there's a way in which you you actually kind of recreate your own sense of the history of that music and that performer. I think that's actually right now, I think I think that's been more enticing in some ways, I think, than anything."

I think the Hilary Mantel trilogy, I think is stunning, particularly the third one, actually, people like the third less, but I thought it's a real two, particularly, particularly if you're interested in politics. I mean, it's of a kind of different order. I've been trying to read a lot more Hindi fiction. And I must confess, I think people like Premchand, I had read at an age where you kind of miss most of it. I mean, you know, you you read, there is such a thing as kind of rereading with a different, I think, lens. There's an academic in Delhi University, a poor one, and the professor of Hindi is a wonderful book on Premchand, actually, which, you know, apart from everything else, is a kind of model of how to read sensitively, you know, and you just makes you look at the stories very, very differently. And it's actually a meditation secularism, because that's a lot of what the Premchand, I think, you know, story is, you know, stories about, I think a lot of, you know, given the theme that we discussed, and this is a course I've been teaching and hope to develop for that is this course on global political thought. And I have to say my acquaintance with both Chinese political thought and broadly what's called Islamic political thought was relatively cursory. I mean, in a new fair bit, some of the classics, but to actually kind of engage, I think, as seriously with it. So the last year, I think a lot of it has, you know, been kind of again, and this is that, that gives you a kind of very different perspective in some senses on how people situated in these societies looking at normative questions and history. And the quality of writing and scholarship is just stunning. I mean, I think. So I think we are at the age where, you know, a lot of lateral reading, in some senses, I think, and drawing lateral connections is probably much more interesting than kind of just digging down in your own furrow."
