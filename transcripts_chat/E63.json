        "message": "How should a person act? When I ask myself this question, I know where to look for answers. I have a set of first principles that I derive these answers from. I have supreme respect for the autonomy of other people. We should never do anything to infringe on other people's individual rights. And everything follows from there. I'm a libertarian, which basically means that the most important word in my dictionary is consent. But let's look beyond how a person should act and ask one more question. How should a country act? Welcome to the scene and the unseen. How should a country act? Are the sole imperatives of a nation to look after the interests of its citizens? Should there be other limitations on it? What meaning does the word morality have in the context of international affairs, which are often a zero-sum game in nature? To discuss all these issues and to talk about foreign policy and the different ways in which foreign policy has evolved through the centuries, I have as my guest today, Nitin Pai. Nitin is an old school blogger like me. He started his blog, which we knew then as Akon, at around the same time as I started India Uncut, in the early 2000s. We became friends back then, and we've had tons of interesting discussions on many subjects, not always in agreement with each other. But my focus was always on individual rights and personal freedoms, and Nitin's was on foreign policy, so we travelled different paths. Nitin quickly became one of the most respected foreign policy experts in this country and started the Takshashila Institution, which he still runs. The online magazine Pragati, which I relaunched as editor last year, is run by the Takshashila Institution. I've been wanting to get Nitin as a guest on the show for quite a while, and now that he's finally agreed, I figured I'd use this chance to take a broad look at foreign policy itself. Here's our conversation. Nitin, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen. Hi Amit, glad to be on your show. Nitin, tell me something. As you know, I'm a libertarian, and when I started forming my views of the world, I've always looked at everything from the perspective of individual rights, thinking about what human behavior is like, what is the moral course of action, and so on and so forth. But there's another way of looking at the world, where you look at, not at individuals as units, but as nation-states as units, and where you talk not of human behavior being between individuals, but between foreign policy where states engage with each other to safeguard their own interests. Now, this is something that I haven't really given much thought to, and there's no one better than you to educate me on this. So, tell me about foreign policy. When did it start evolving? What are the sort of different directions it went in? How should we think about this?"

        "message": "Yeah, I think, let's start from the beginning. I think one of the very interesting conversations I have with my libertarian friends is that the libertarian discomfort with the idea of a state. But you look at it as a practical matter. Individuals have rights and freedoms and all that, but all those liberties become real only when they are protected by some entity, and that entity is a state. Now, you could have a state like North Korea, which just protects its own liberties and the liberties of its leaders and nothing else. Or you could have a liberal democratic state, which takes some of your freedoms, mainly your right to use force, and guarantees the rest of the freedoms to you by means of a social contract. So, the state is a very important institution in the protection of liberty. And this sits very, you know, uncomfortably with very strong classical libertarians, right? But the state is important. Now, the state operates, unfortunately, in an anarchy. And when you say an anarchy, it's not about chaos and disorder, but the idea that there is no international government, there is no authority over and above a nation state, which ensures that states behave and follow the rules of the road or the international law. Now, because states have to operate in this anarchic outfit, they have to be able to protect themselves. Survival of the state is the most important thing. Now, I would look at it from the perspective of a liberal democratic republic like India. The reason why I am interested in the survival and the security of the Indian Republic is because the Indian Republic is what makes my liberties real. I have an interest in ensuring that the Republic of India is not internally overthrown or externally taken over by foreign invaders or by foreign regimes, which might not give me the same kind of liberty and freedoms that I have. Now, the question of how do you protect the state? How does the state secure itself and its way of life has been one of those eternal questions, which has preoccupied the minds of statesmen and scholars and intellectuals since thousands of years. And one answer which most of these people have come to, regardless of their tradition, is that you need to have power. How much power? As much power as you can get. Why do you need as much power as you can get? Because you can't be sure that the other state out there will not accumulate more power and use that power to overthrow you or take over you or bully you or dominate you. So, the quest for more and more power relative to everybody else is what animates most states and that lies at the heart of foreign policy. And foreign policy is as old as human civilization. Since the time probably when humans came together and started forming bands and groups of like-minded or with kin relationships, they would have had to interact with other tribes or clans or groups of a similar nature and that's when foreign policy started."

That's broadly, if I've summed it up correctly. Now, when we talk about foreign policy and how it evolved and so on, a point that you often made is that it's evolved differently in different parts of the world. It's not this one monolithic body of thought, but there are different traditions. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?"

We just said the whole of international relations can be explained by a divide between the people who consume alcohol and the people who don't.

Or international relations, rather the relationship between one state and the other, right? Let's start with the ancient Indian way of looking at things made famous by the Arthashastra, which was supposedly written in Takshashila, after which our institution is named. Now, if you look at the Arthashastra view of interstate relations, he looks, Kautilya, let me say, Kautilya is the guy who wrote this. It's a shorthand for a number of authors, but let's use the word Kautilya for now. So, he sees the center of the focus of policy as this character called a Vijigishu or the person who wants to be a victor. So, he's a king and he sees that around him are a bunch of kings who are sovereign equals and the business of the Vijigishu is to prevail over those neighboring kings and impose his domain on those. So, it is about conquest. Sort of imperialism in a sense. It's imperialism in the sense that it's a conquest of other kings around you. So, he says that, okay, the guys immediately around you are your foes, are your adversaries and the guys one hop away are your allies because they are the adversaries' adversaries and so on and so forth. So, he creates a very geometrical kind of a thing where you have concentric circles, everybody in an even numbered circle is your ally and everybody in an odd numbered circle\u2026"

So, as your empire grows, people who are probably formerly your allies now become your adversaries because you are interested in that domain. There is a caveat to this because Indian international relations did not envisage looking invading territories which are not part of the Indian subcontinent. So, it was almost considered a dharma to go and impose your rule on people who don't accept that way of life. So, there was a sort of a psychological geographical border to or a frontier to how much expansionism Indian strategic thought\u2026"

        "message": "That's right. There was a, at least in the strategic sense, there was a zero-sum. Within the bounds of the subcontinent, your job is to expand your empire until it occupies the natural boundaries of the subcontinent. And, of course, you could trade and do business and all that even when you are at war or when you are not at war. But the strategic objective of the Vijay Gishu was to expand his empire and to cover the whole of the subcontinent. But note that while the Vijay Gishu was engaged in expansionism, the Vijay Gishu would recognize sovereign equals. He would recognize that there are other kings who are sovereign equals in terms of status. They are the kings of their own kingdoms. It so happens that I am interested in conquering you, but I accept the fact that you are a sovereign equal. Now, this is important because the Indian strategic thought accepted the idea of multiple sovereignties. Now, this is very different from the Chinese perspective. You see, how it evolved in China, at least for the last 2000 plus years, is that the Chinese strategic thought looks at Han Chinese civilization as the middle kingdom, which is led by an emperor who has a mandate from heaven and who imposes his heavenly rule on the entire planet or on the entire earth. They might not have seen it as a planet, but on the whole of the earth. The Han Chinese middle kingdom is where civilization is and everybody outside the middle kingdom is either a tributary or a barbarian. They distinguish this to say that, okay, if we have a chance to subjugate the people beyond our borders and make them accept the primacy of Chinese culture and make them pay tribute, then we recognize them as tributaries. They are not our equals, they are our tributaries. But let's say there are people who are nomadic, who are, you know, who are warlike and who we consider uncivilizable, we look at them as barbarians. Now, this is a very different way of looking at the world as compared to what the Indians, the ancient Indians looked at. Because you recognize only one entity as the sole sovereign on earth and there are no other equals. So, the emperor of China did not recognize sovereign equals. Now, this led to very interesting situations like, for example, in the 15th and the 16th centuries when European travelers and emissaries first went to China, they presented their credentials to the people there and said, look, we come in the name of our emperor and we want to establish relationships with you. And the Chinese said, what nonsense is this? We don't recognize, we don't recognize any other emperor. If you insist that there is another emperor in Europe, we are going to imprison you. So, many diplomats and emissaries from both the Catholic Church as well as European kingdoms were imprisoned by the Chinese because they did not accept, you know, conceptually that there can be another emperor. The only way that foreign ambassadors would get an interview with the emperor is to say that, look, okay, I come in the name of this guy who is your tributary and I kowtow to you. So, that's a very profound difference between the way the Indians and the Europeans see things and the Chinese see things."

But there might be people like the nomadic types of Central Asia, like the Mongols, for example, the most famous ones. They have been these tribes for a long time and they don't accept Chinese, Han Chinese authority. So, you would try and subdue them using war or you would build a huge wall to protect your civilization from the barbarians to your west. So, that's how they saw it.

Let me start with the European one, the Westphalian one, which evolved due to 1000 years of war in Europe, the Catholic Church was there, the Holy Roman Empire was there, various principalities were there. They had, you know, 1000 years of conflict and war and developments, political developments in Europe. And then in the 16th century, after a particularly bloody period of war, they decided that look, let's agree on a system where whoever controls a particular country becomes the absolute sovereign of that country. Because this is interesting, because before that, if you were living in, let's say, a village in what is today Germany, you would be paying tribute to your local feudal lord. You would be known to be in the principality of a certain baron or a prince of Germany. You would also be under the jurisdiction of a bishop, who was part of the of the church system, Catholic or Protestant, and would also be perhaps part of the Holy Roman Empire. Right? So, there was your political\u2026 This independent and overlapping jurisdiction. Independent and overlapping jurisdiction and was a huge source of confusion. For example, the Pope could claim jurisdiction over the Catholics in Italy and in France and in England. And the kings of those places would say, hey, these are my subjects and I have authority over them. But the church would say, no, it's, you know, they're Catholics, so they are under my jurisdiction. And suddenly the Holy Roman Emperor would come out from somewhere and said, no, they're actually my subjects. So, this confusion ended in a series of treaties called the Treaties of Westphalia, where they came to the simple conclusion that there is a territory and whoever rules the territory controls the subjects, you know."

They would just accept and assimilate people, you know, maybe using what you would call today a soft power and say, look, you are part of the Chinese sphere of influence. They had no necessity to go and conquer and plant their flag or, you know, even convert people into Chinesism. As opposed to Islam being a revealed religion filled its adherence with a zeal to spread that faith. So, the conquest of other lands was as much indicated by faith with assurances that because this is a superior faith, you are necessarily going to win. And that was a confidence which they had. And early Islamic invaders were all filled with unnatural confidence, which maybe allowed them to make these conquests fairly easily because you would do things which you would not do if you were a rational person."

You know, the West was dominating, the victors of the Second World War created an international system, which is largely based on the Westphalian pattern, where if you're the, you know, you could be Angola, you could be Tanzania, you could be India, you could be Bangladesh, these are independent nation states, which would be recognized each other as sovereign equals, everybody has one vote in the United Nations General Assembly, so on and so forth. Now, that construct is really a Westphalian construct. And it was held together by the power of the West. Now, the West could have been the Soviet Union or the United States or the NATO countries. But it was generally a Western mental model, which is imposed on the rest of the world. Now, as you see the West diminishing in power relative to China and India, as the center of gravity of world order moves away from the West, the question is, what kind of a world order will be shaped? And what would be the rules of the game, right? It's not clear that the new powers that will rise relative to each other and relative to the West in the next 10, 20, 30 years, will necessarily agree to the rules of the game, which were agreed upon 100 years ago, by the victors of the Second World War. The Chinese definitely do not see the Westphalian system as something which they're comfortable with. I've spoken to many Chinese scholars and asked them this question to say that, you know, how much of modern Chinese foreign policy adheres to the Middle Kingdom mindset, the Tiansha Middle Kingdom mindset. And many of them told me that it is a serious factor in the mental models of the policymakers in modern China. In other words, China would, if given a chance, would like to see a return to this way of looking at international relations, where China is the Middle Kingdom and everybody else is either a tributary or a barbarian. What are the practical implications of this? What this means is that at one end of the spectrum, we know that the United States and China will fight for global dominance. This is not just a question for being number one, but it is also a fight for what kind of rules of the games are we going to have in the international system going forward. The other end of it is, how does China look at its neighborhood? For example, if the Chinese mental model sees itself as the heaven, Middle Kingdom, and everybody else has different levels of status as a tributary, do they recognize Vietnam? Do they recognize Thailand? Do they recognize India and Nepal as sovereign equals? Or do they see us as tributaries of some kind? Now, the question is different if you're a small country on the border of China, you don't have much of a choice. You know, if Chinese power becomes so strong compared to you, you will have to kowtow or toe the line in one way or the other. But it's different for a country like India, which is large enough to not easily succumb to the Chinese intellectual dominance in the way you look at foreign policy or international relations. The question for India is, how do we deal with a neighbor who might not necessarily see you as a sovereign equal and might want you to be a tributary? India does not see itself as a tributary of anybody, right? And we are happy to see others as sovereign equals, including very, very small countries like Nauru. But we are not in the business of seeing anybody as a tributary, nor are we in the business of being seeing ourselves as a tributary."

In fact, if you look at foreign policy of India in the last 20 years, even the smaller countries who used to be largely under India's dominance, whether it's Nepal, Bhutan, or the Maldives and Sri Lanka to some extent, have been allowed with New Delhi's acquiescence to go their own way. Bhutan has its own constitution. Nepal has its own constitution. India, for example, changed the terms of the friendship treaty with Bhutan to allow the Bhutanese government a lot more autonomy in its foreign relations. So I think that's the trend. I don't think the Republic of India ever sees itself as being a hegemon and dominating or maybe conquering territory. It doesn't make sense in the 21st century in any case. But China is different. One thing about China is that I think they are right now under President Xi Jinping of a mind, which I would call the geopolitical front foot. They feel that they are already much bigger and much stronger than is understood and felt. And therefore, they have the need to actually be on the front foot and impose and assert themselves in various places, whether it's the South China Sea, whether it's in Central Asia and Eastern Europe, and of course, the Indian Ocean."

So knowledge is the currency of power in the 21st century, not land anymore. Land is matters to you because it, you know, it supports the population. So it's knowledge in terms of technology, how to do things. We are in a knowledge economy and knowledge can be used to create all other forms of power, right? Knowledge can be turned into wealth and wealth can be turned into military power. So knowledge at the end is at the heart of military power. So territorial conquests are not so meaningful. I think what the Chinese are trying to do is not so much to conquer territory, but to acquire enough influence in enough parts of the world so as to reshape the world in the way they want to see. So they want to change the, you know, the Westphalian system enough that it becomes more Chinese in its nature. For that, they'll need to have influence in many existing parts of the world because, for example, if you want to win a vote in the United Nations General Assembly, you need the support of so many countries.

So survival and security of your state is your primary national interest, which because it also means happiness, prosperity and well being of your people, in case of a liberal democracy.

So there are no absolute answers to this and and morality in the sense the interpersonal morality or a domestic morality which we have just does not apply to international relations and we'll end up with very very wrong outcomes if we try and apply the morality of interpersonal relations to international relations."

I mean it's very different from the trolley problem and the significant way in which that is so is that every human life is equal in the trolley problem and you just have to choose between doing the action or not doing. And here I think a question also is that you fundamentally place a value on say your own citizen, which is much higher than those of other nations. But I think my question is half-baked and we'll leave that discussion for some other time. Looking ahead as someone involved in the foreign policy space in India, what do you think are the greatest challenges we face and what do you think are sort of the recent mistakes we might have made in terms of mindset or strategy?"

        "message": "I think the greatest challenge we face is to change our mindsets in keeping with our rising prosperity. You know, 50 years ago, India was not a prosperous country, at least compared to now. We could absorb, for example, wars on our borders or even within our country because the costs of those wars were rather small. As India becomes more and more prosperous, we will not be able to suffer the damage on our borders or within our countries. So you need to be able to keep threats as far away from the borders as possible to defend the homeland because you can't sustain damage on the homeland. The United States, for example, has a huge military presence across the world, not because they want to conquer the rest of the world, but they don't want conflict on their homeland. So you deploy military forces as far away from your borders as possible so that you can defuse the threats as far away from your homeland as possible so as to protect the homeland so that the homeland can grow and enjoy prosperity, peace, and so on. The problem with India is that throughout our history, we have subscribed to something which I call the Panipat school of thought. It says that don't worry about external enemies until they turn up on the plains of Panipat. And when they are on the plains of Panipat or maybe on the gates of Delhi, then you muster your forces and then you go and try and fight them, which means all these conflicts take place within our territory. There might be advantages to fighting on your own soil, but the fact is that damage occurs on your territory and you have to expel the invaders from your territory. I don't think this kind of a Panipat model is sustainable as India becomes more and more prosperous. I've argued that we need something which I call the Hindu Kush model, where you foresee the threat far away from home on the borders of the Hindu Kush mountains, metaphorically, as far away as possible and sort of defuse the threats there, which means you need to be able to project power far away from our shores in order to prevent those threats from coming onto our shores and our borders. And that I think has been the biggest challenge for Indian foreign policy because it requires us to overturn over, you know, maybe centuries or millennia of thinking."

        "message": "Well, the nature of the threats have changed, but are also cumulative. The old threats haven't gone away. We just have a new set of threats which are more diffused, which could, for all you know, be non-state actors, could be environmental, could be technological. All these threats have sort of added up onto our basket of threats. The old ones have not gone away. Regardless of the kind of threat, all the damage that occurs on the homeland will be increasingly more and more expensive, both in economic and strategic terms. We will not be able to sustain damage on the homeland. Any attack on the homeland comes with massive economic costs, comes with massive political costs and creates massive amount of tensions among the plural society that we have. So we should be able to fend off the threats as far away from our borders as possible."
