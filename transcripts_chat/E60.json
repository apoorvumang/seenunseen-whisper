Imagine that, GPS Zindabad. Well, today's episode is about water, which is something that people like me are lucky enough to take for granted, while millions in this country are not. Now, usually things get better. But in this regard, matters might actually get worse. We think of water as an endless resource. But could India actually be running out of water?"

Millions of Indians don't have access to clean drinking water. But those who run the country take it for granted. I always assumed, though, that the issue here was distribution. I thought, well, we have the ocean on three sides, we are a land of rivers. It's just a question of using technology to make all this water drinkable and then distributing it efficiently. Well, I discovered while recording this episode, that my notions about water were completely wrong, and that we might be headed for a water crisis. My guest for this episode is Vishwanath S. He is well known on Twitter as Zen Rain Man, and has been an activist for water conservation for over three decades. I'd heard a lot about him. And as I didn't know anything about the subject, I invited him over for an episode. We recorded this in Bangalore a couple of weeks ago. Listen, Vishwanath, thanks so much for coming on the scene and the unseen. Pleasure. Vishwanath, you worked in the field of water conservation and in the field of water generally for more than three decades now, 32 years, 32 years. And these days, there's been a lot of news about Bangalore's water wars, and so on and so forth. Can you contextualize our current problems for me a little bit?"

One striking example for me, which has driven me to work in this particular sector also has been the dependence on groundwater. We have close to 33 million wells and borewells. We take out 250 cubic kilometers of water, that's groundwater every year. So this is far more than what the next two nations, China and the USA combined to. Together China and USA take about 220 cubic kilometers out, India takes 250 cubic kilometers of groundwater out. So this dependence on groundwater is something stunning."

This discovery that a hole in the ground could yield water was something stunning for civilization. Some tectonic shift happened. You were no longer tied to the tyranny of rivers and lakes. You could go to the countryside, dig a hole in the ground, find water and survive. And it looks like the ancients in India cracked that particular form of knowledge. So therefore, you were anywhere and everywhere and remember this country of ours, what is now what we call India is two-thirds semi-arid, it's in the Deccan Plateau. So the rivers are ephemeral, they're not permanent, they're not perennial rivers. And then when you have to survive for the whole year, you look for solutions and the well was a striking solution."

So the wells spoke to us, it would tell you summer is coming. So you started to alter your behavior depending on the water availability. The well was both functional and communicative, it rewarded you for good behavior. If you recharged around the surrounding areas, if you protected the forest, then the well had plenty of water. If you dumped waste material, well, the well would get polluted and you wouldn't be able to use the water. So these signals of communication and functionality was something striking about the well. Come the 60s, and then we slipped into the era of the borewell. The borewell stopped communicating to us, they only communicate to us twice, once when they strike water and once when they're dead, actually."

In the 60s, the mid 60s, there was a continuous drought for three years, and there was actually famine, there was food shortage and great water shortage. And UNICEF brought in these drilling rigs from the UK, Denmark and the USA, hard rock drilling rigs, about 18 of them, and started drilling for water. These went off into the villages of Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, and they brought life saving water. So they were a big boon at that particular point of time because the wells had dried up. The borewells had to be dug to about 100-200 feet, which the wells would not have reached. And then the hand pump was attached to it, and life saving water came. But in a peculiar Indian tradition, we took the drilling rig, jugadofied it and started to make the rig itself. So, small town of Tiruchangod in Tamil Nadu is now one of the leading exporters of borewell drilling rigs in the world. These rigs then started to get used for irrigation and agriculture, farmers started to drill it, they were uncontrolled, nobody controlled the number of wells that were being dug. And actually, the political establishment started to give free electricity for the pump sets to mine water from these, and so they spread rapidly, became politically uncontrollable and started to exploit a lot of water. Two consequences, the benefits, of course, of the Green Revolution came from groundwater, a lot of people argue not from the dams of India. The second consequence on health, for a long for a short time, diseases like the guinea worm were eliminated, waterborne diseases became less because groundwater was pure water. But slowly, poisons such as fluoride and arsenic started to emerge. Now we have a situation, because of our dependency on these deep borewells, that about 66 million Indians are consuming fluoride contaminated water and about 18 million Indians are consuming arsenic contaminated water."

And, you know, before I ask you to elaborate on the unseen effects, you spoke about how the spread of borewells was, you hinted that it was perhaps more than it should have been. And, you know, partly because of government incentives, like free power, which allowed people to pump up as much water as they wanted. And we started, we jugarified and we started making them ourselves. And can you elaborate on that a bit, like how, like, was the was the spreading of borewells at what point does it sort of become a con rather than a pro?"

I think in the initial days when the Geological Society of India, which was one of the strong proponents of the hard rock drilling rig and the borewell, went about its business, farmers did not believe that a four inch hole in the ground could actually yield water. So they had to be persuaded by scientists who actually dug these borewells and drew the clean water out. And I think even in the minds of the geologists, it was not clear that we were going to run out of groundwater, because we had not formed a good idea of how much water was actually there, what was the volume that was being recharged annually, and what were the areas from which these deep borewells were being recharged. I think that hydrogeological science is only now developing in India, we are doing something called sub aquifer mapping, trying to understand these hard rock aquifers in a more thorough manner, which we did not know in the 60s and 70s. So we went about assuming infinite resource. And I think that was the handicap. So one does not lay blame on a deliberate attempt to create a scarcity. But this is the very nature of technology and science. It seems that we create problems, and then overcome them with solutions, which are actually greater problems."

Looking at those learnings, what can you say are the and also the point you made about the information that a person living on the land has about the water content of the land disappearing because you this was now unseen the water at the borewell was striking as opposed to the scene water in a well, which you're in touch with every day.

And so if we want to revive our rivers, which is now quite a thing with society, then we have to get our groundwater tables high. It's a relationship not understood pretty well. The second point is what it did was it caused farmers to take loans to drill borewells.

Slowly the population starts to increase, in the 50s we are faced with a set of droughts and in the 60s it becomes striking because we get three year drought, continuous drought and then we have a hand-to-mouth living as is described with grains coming from the USA, PL 480. At the time there's a war with Pakistan 65 coincidentally or otherwise and now our dependence on food becomes a security risk for us. So we start to think what we should do. Caesar Bramaniam steps out, Prasad Swaminathan and meet Norman Borlaug and the high yielding dwarf variety, the Mexican dwarf variety of wheat comes to India. This dwarf variety needs actually more water and it needs lots of groundwater for its productivity to increase. It needs fertilizers, it needs pesticides. Then comes the rice, the International Rice Research Institute is established in Odisha to begin with, later on shifted to the Philippines, they developed IR 64, a wonderful hybrid variety which comes to the Tanjavur belt which is in the Cauvery area. These wheat and rice strains are now demanding water, they are producing food security and informally, subversively farmers are drilling bore wells to feed this water but we are fixated on the food output. We are not looking at what's happening to the water depletion and slowly the spread of this both these varieties is all across India. In the meantime, the hard rock drilling rigs have come technologically speaking. They have started to replace the traditional diesel pump or the animal driven lifting devices. They now start to dig deeper and deeper and start to move everywhere. Free power is started to be given to the farmers because the farmer lobby is a strong lobby, agriculture is a strong lobby and so therefore, this depletes groundwater even further because it is indiscriminate use of the groundwater, flood irrigation, it is not drip or sprinkler irrigation. And slowly eventually, we are into 33 million bore wells and 250 cubic kilometers of water over time. Now, we realize the gravity of the situation, we start to figure out areas where groundwater is depleting and we try to bring control through law, it does not work, none of the places in India, groundwater rules and legislations are working because the number, sheer number of bore wells to manage and regulate has become too huge. Now, we are in an era where we want to recharge the aquifers and try to make it up but we still have not found an idea for demand management. Until we find a balance between demand management and what goes in into the groundwater as rainwater, strike a balance, we will be in for tough times."

So, let's imagine about 40 or 50 farmers come together, link up their bore wells, use drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation so that they are effective, put up a rain gauge in the place and understand how much it rained. Based on the rainfall, take a call on how much water is recharged these bore wells and therefore, use and grow crops which require less water than what it rained. So, if this year it rained less, you grow millets, if it rained more, you grow paddy. That kind of a call. You link up the groundwater and build that groundwater knowledge, link the bore wells. The pooling also brings in market feasibilities. You can buy seeds cheaper, you can sell to the market as a cooperative, as a unit, as a producer unit.

So, this business of modernity, which started to bring piped water to homes with all good intentions to remove the duress that women had to go to bring the water and make things easier. Pipe water inside the house caused this disconnect, because you don't know where the pipe water is coming from, how much there is water in the rivers and all. So, some examples are striking, what we are trying to do is to merge both the pipe network as well as groundwater. Belgaum is a striking example. When they ran out of water for the pipe network, an engineer there called RS Nayak thought about the old open wells there and with the help of the community mobilized and cleaned up those old open wells. The community promised not to chuck Ganesh idols into it, garbage into it. In return, with some small funding, they were able to put up water networks for the local community 500 people, 1000 people, sometimes even 10,000 peoples, a local network linked to the local well, pipe water to your homes. So, here's an incentive for the community to keep their wells clean, to recharge water and then in turn they get water. As opposed to the pipe water supply, which cost them about 12 rupees a kiloliter, the water from the well was only 75 paisa a kiloliter and I'm talking 75 paisa for 1000 liter. So, there's an economic benefit and an ecological benefit and an environmental benefit plus sustainability. And this water supply scheme is giving water to 200,000 people in Belgaum of a population of 500,000 people. Kundapur, which is close by, started to get 24 bar 7 pipe water supply. Well, when the residents were asked to connect and pay a connection fee, they said, we already have our 24 bar 7 supply from our wells, they're giving us 24 bar 7 and we're in charge of these wells. So, why do we need your pipe water connection? So, somewhere these two will have to meet the pipe water network aspirations of the people and the well as a sustainable water resource and the community understanding what the well is. And so, that challenge will have to be played itself out differently in states like Kerala, in small towns and cities and in the vast rural areas of India."

And this example is Rainbow Drive on Sarjapur Road, just opposite Wipro, 36 acres of campus, 360 plots, not connected to the city utility network. What would they have done? Each one of them would have drilled a bore well as they build their homes. So, you would have 360 straws emptying out the cup of water, each competing with the other, pretty soon it would be finished. When we worked with the community and the community had some reasonably enlightened leadership, what they did was they banned private bore wells, they said we'll sink three community bore wells and we'll share the groundwater, but 360 will now compulsorily recharge the aquifers. So, each one of them will make a recharge well, which is about three feet in diameter and about 20 feet to 30 feet deep, pick up all the rooftop water, the water which flows on the roads and make sure that it's filtered and send it into the aquifer."

So, you got 360 recharge wells, but only three wells which were drying. Still this was not enough. When we did a water balance for them, we figured that they were consuming 265 liters per person per day. With all the rainwater harvesting they do, they're still overdrawing on the aquifer. So, they had to get it down to 130. They put a meter in every connection, they price the water. So, if it's more than 20,000 liters per month consumption for a household, they pay 120 rupees a kiloliter. The consumption came down to something like 120 liters per capita per day. With the monies that the institution collected, they were able to invest in a wastewater treatment plant. They pick up treated wastewater and send it to the households for non-potable use. So, again, the net freshwater demand has dropped to something like 80 liters per capita per day. They are now contributing to the city of Bangalore, they're contributing water. They're self-sufficient, they're sustainable, and they have perhaps the cheapest water in town. So, these kind of examples, this is 36 acres, it's now being replicated in a 70 acre layout. It's gone to a 200 acre layout where they've discovered that the basements were flooding and the wells had water and they were buying water at the same time. So, this sort of mental map in which we've forgotten what shallow aquifers and wells are, are being regenerated."

So, my question to you there is that, let's say that as a society, it's a problem we need to solve. What is, what is the role that the government can play in it with all the incentives because they are usually focused on the short term, and they have different kinds of special interest groups? And what is the role that we cannot look to government to play, that we have to say that society has to make these moves and these ideas, and these values have to spread through society? How hard is that?"

We're faced with 21st century problems. And unless we redefine our institutions and get them to be able, capacitated enough to be able to address our problems, we're going to be stuck with some challenges. From a policy perspective, the city of Bangalore, Chennai, for example, drives a rainwater harvesting policy, which makes it mandatory for every household to do rainwater harvesting. It's not being implemented at the efficiency and effectiveness, which it should be. But a beginning has been made. And why it's not being implemented is something that we need to crack because we do not have a good communication outreach to persuade citizens to understand the benefits of doing it. But if we do that, then we have a substantial amount of recharge of our aquifers. So therefore, our bore wells and groundwater open wells can come back to life. If lakes are rejuvenated, and if they're fed with treated wastewater, so in the rainy season, you feed the lakes with rainwater, in the non-rainy season, you feed them with treated wastewater which comes in through constructed wetlands. And there's an example in Jakkur, there's an example in a lake called Rajanalli, Puttanalli, many examples are there. Then these lakes recharge that shallow aquifer and a huge amount of groundwater becomes available for the city to reuse, right. So a wastewater policy which talks about ecological use of treated wastewater to recharge aquifers. A groundwater policy which says, okay, in a particular area, you're not allowed to sink individual bore wells, but community bore wells will supply you water. A rainwater harvesting policy, wastewater policy, groundwater policy, all talking to each other and reinforcing sustainability is the way for government to think and work upon. At a policy level, that's already happening, we need more better implementation."

The 20th century architecture of institutions was one of supply management, the resource was available in plenty, you needed engineering skill sets to pump water from a large distance. The Bangalore Water Supply Storage Board, set up in 1964, was the first water utility set up in India. And its biggest achievement was that it brought water from the Cauvery River in 1972, which is 100 kilometers away and 300 meters below the city. Huge engineering challenge. Now the resource itself is running out. But what this institution is geared for is to pump water to the city. So its next imagination is to bring water from the Sharavati River, which is 340 kilometers from Bangalore. Whereas what it perhaps needs to do is to look at the ecological resource available within the city like rainwater, wastewater, groundwater, and manage it. But there is not a single hydrogeologist in the institution. There's not a single hydrologist. There's not a single ecologist. How can that hockey team play football, which is what is being asked of them?"

However, I think we can find a midway by which we commit ourselves to a long term plan, which is cutting across political frontiers, but then use the democratic cycle for equity and distribution, which is as critical as resource management. The big challenge for our cities is not how much water is coming in as much as who is getting this water. Here the political system can play a major role in making sure that there is equity. So I see a lot of merit, but what we need from civic society groups and activist groups is to be able to understand the weaknesses of the system and address those in a solution mode rather than to keep on harping on problems and highlighting problems.

I've had great joy and happiness in being able to understand the complexity of the problem and trying to see how individually and as teams, different kinds of teams, we're able to push the solution envelope a bit more. Luckily, 14 years of my initial life in the job sector, I spent with Housing and Urban Development Corporation, which is the Government of India undertaking. So I know how the government thinks I was lucky enough to do that. And that job gave me exposure to many geographies of South India, especially I must have visited every alternate village and almost every town and city as part of that job. So it was a huge learning experience and one learned the strengths of government and the limitations of government. Then once you stepped out, the challenge was, how do you work with communities, academic institutions, and even the government from a policy influence part of you. So it's important to build a brand around yourself and a thought process that you do. So that has been very important. I think you must be seen as somebody who does not have an agenda, which is political or whatever, personality driven, but which seeks to bring positive change to communities, individuals. The response has been fabulous. I mean, I have the choice are from working with well diggers, traditional well diggers. There are a community who have been digging wells in India for 1200 years now, and who have run out of a livelihood because nobody's digging wells, but everybody's digging bore wells. So how do you make sure that they get a job? So in the policy, we said in the rainwater harvesting policy, which I was fortunate enough to write with the government was to say, hey, everybody will make a recharge well. So suddenly the livelihood opportunities for these well diggers came up and the well diggers learned a new skill and a new trade. You pick up rainwater and you send it into wells, they didn't know a damn about it. Now many of these wells have water. So there's at least 10,000 open wells in Bangalore with water in it. So people call them again to clean it up every year, which was what they used to do before and deepen it a bit more and make sure that the water quality is improved. So you see that solving a water problem is also engaging with history, livelihoods, its economic benefits, its social benefits, and all these add up to ecological benefits.

If you take a city like Bangalore and there are 1.8 million households, the city of Bangalore's problems of water is 1.8 million problems, which then agglomerate. So therefore, you can become part of that 1.8 million solutions because you occupy one of those households and one of those homes. The thing to do is to start to understand what water is in your household level itself. And it's not rocket science if you want to, you can cut down consumption 30%, 40% if intent is there. You need space between the years, you don't need space anywhere else. Second is to look at the rainfall in your apartment, in your building and see what's happening to it and whether it can be put to better use. And one of the better uses is to make sure that it goes and infiltrates into the ground. These are immediate actions. The second set of actions is to reach out at a community or a watershed level. There is a lake within two kilometers of every apartment or house in Bangalore, step in into the lake on a Sunday, which we try and get what we call friends of lakes to come. Pick up 10 plastic bags from that lake. The next time somebody chucks a plastic bag in that lake and you realize you're going to pick it up, it really makes you mad. So your ownership of the lake is generated by simple small actions and then work with groups to figure out what needs to be done to save the lake. It's not going to be easy, but you'll understand the political ramifications, the challenges which a city has to go through in managing water. And it gives you pretty much a can-do kind of a positive moment. And I think we need to work at a lot of these can-dos at various scales, you know, you engage with your corporator, engage with your MLA, engage with your water utility provider and see how the challenges they think that exist and what can be done by you as a participant."
