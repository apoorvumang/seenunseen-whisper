I went to the bar to get a cocktail for myself and bumped into a man there who was bare chested and wore just a dirty dhoti. It was Vijay Mallya. Mr. Mallya, I said surprised, what are you doing back in India? Oh, hi Amit, he said, call me Vijay. It's so good to finally meet you. I really love your podcast, The Seen and the Unseen. I used to be unseen and now I am seen again. Arre bro, answer my question, I said. How did you come back to India? I thought you defaulted on your loans. I thought you were on the run, Mr. Mallya said. I was. Now I am not. I simply got myself declared as a farmer and then my loans were waived, muhahahahaha, muhahahaha."

So early 2008, this was just before Manmohan Singh government announced a farm loan waiver of about 60,000 crore, if I'm not mistaken. So my father, he was a bank manager for a regional rural bank in a small town in Bihar and as part of his day-to-day job, he has given and disbursed a lot of loans. And one particular kind of loan was something under which is disbursed to farmers called Kisan Credit Cards. So this is a small sum of money which is given to farmers to meet their daily production, you know, expenses. So it was a small sum of money for 50,000 rupees. So this guy who the money was given to, he comes to my father with 40,000 rupees with the intention of returning as a lump sum payment back to the bank and says that before depositing the money, he says to my dad that, sir, I have been listening to the stories, a lot of murmurs and chatter that there is going to be a farm loan waiver, you know, politicians are talking about it, probably something is going to come. And then my father convinces him that, you know, why you should still deposit because it was the job of my father to convince him and so that, you know, the banks continue to do good business. And overall, basically, he agrees and he deposits the money. And just about a few days later, Manmohan Singh government comes and announces the farm loan waiver. So a few days later, he comes back to see my dad in the bank and says, sir, my neighbor who has taken the loan with no intention of returning the money is now going to get the entire, you know, his loan waived off, while just because I made the mistake of being an honest borrower and paying back on time, I am stuck with getting no relief."

And economists, of course, as you know, call this a moral hazard. The same principle, for example, applies to the bailouts of banks, big banks too big to fail that happened after the 2008 crisis, that if you know you're going to get bailed out, if you know you're going to get a waiver, then you don't have to behave responsibly because the consequences of that are not what they otherwise would be."

It amounts to a redistribution of wealth from common voters to either specific interest groups who fund the parties or to specific vote banks. This is farm loan waivers, of course, a very overt case of this kind of redistribution because the money doesn't come from nowhere. And farmers, of course, are a valuable vote bank.

So this is like, you know, rubbing salt on their wounds. And how much are the people who actually? I think that number is around one and a half lakh. So essentially, anybody who's defaulted gets a benefit, you know, of six times, you know, more than someone who's not defaulted. So anyone who's not defaulted ends up looking very, very stupid.

So one of the things that has happened, you know, during the course of this year is that farmers have ended up producing more of, you know, products like pulses, onions, etc. Now, what has happened is that because of that, the prices have crashed. Now, the government declares a minimum support price for 23 crops, but it buys only, primarily buys only two crops at the MSP, rice and wheat. It has also started buying pulses over the last couple of years. And, you know, during the course of the last financial year, only around 5% of pulses were bought at the MSP. So what has happened because of that is that, you know, farmers have not been able to sell their pulses even at the MSP. So prices have gone below the MSP. Why did they grow so many pulses? Because what has happened is one is, you know, they look at the past prices where in, you know, over the last two years, dal prices have gone through the roof, and in particular urad dal, no, in particular, toor dal, not urad. So toor dal prices crossed 200 rupees per kg. And because of that, the production went up by close to 80% this year. Now, the problem is that, you know, there is no buying mechanism in place as far as the government and the MSP pricing is concerned. So the prices have crashed, particularly in Maharashtra, where a lot of toor dal is grown. And so farmers are protesting, at least in Maharashtra, because of, you know, dal prices, they're also protesting because onion prices have crashed this year. So we don't have, you know, a good storage mechanism in place. So that's one major reason why there is an agriculture crisis."

And even if it's now swinging in the other direction, where farmers are screwed, because they've made too many pulses and whatever, again, this overproduction is partly because of government not allowing those market signals to accurately reach the farmers.

Now, what has happened is this year, there has been an overproduction, which has led to a crash in prices. Next year, the production will fall and the prices will rise again, will go up. The other thing that new needs point that needs to be made here is in the case of pulses is that, you know, this year, the production of pulses has grown by around 37%. And you know, we produced around 22.4 million tons of pulses in total, which is the highest ever production that has happened. Now, this is this should have been good news. But one reason why it's turned out to be a bad news is because, you know, export of pulses is banned, whereas imports are allowed. So you know, in a year when the maximum production of pulses has happened, the maximum import of pulses has also happened, which is crazy, which is sort of crazy.

In case of onions, the story is a little more, you know, interesting. So the one of the biggest onion markets in India is in Rasalgaon near Nashik. And I looked at data for the month of January.

And next week, we're going to have an episode where I talk with Shruti Rajagopalan about the right to the right to property, how it's happened over the years.

Recently, I think it was Ajit Ranade who wrote about him. So it all started with the after independence, India wanted to focus on industries, to wanted to promote industries. Now that you want to do it, you want to depress the prices of agriculture produced so that laborers could be, you know, could access them at a very cost effective manner. So now to do that, you have to subsidize all those inputs. So just we talked about, you know, whether fertilizer, electricity, water, all those subsidies happen.

I mean, see, now, if you look at the state of Maharashtra, their original fiscal deficit for this year was supposed to be around 37,289 crore with the farm loan waiver coming in, it'll double. Now, that money has to be raised from somewhere. Now, one way is obviously you sort of raise some sort of taxes. I mean, you tax petrol more, you know, you know, right now, in Mumbai, when you buy petrol, you pay a drought charge. So there is a per litre drought charge. Now, you know, this year, as far as we understand, there has been no drought. So why are we still paying a drought charge? The other point is, obviously, most of these state governments, in fact, most of the money which is waived off, will have to be borrowed, it will have to be borrowed because, you know, banks cannot face these losses. So the state governments will have to compensate these banks. Now, when the state government borrows, you know, what it does is, it's the fiscal deficit of the state government goes up, when the fiscal deficit of the state government goes up, the fiscal deficit of the nation as a whole also goes up. State governments are ultimately able to borrow because their debt is guaranteed by the central government. So in that sense, you know, ultimately, it's, you know, the debt of the central government may not be going up, but the liability definitely is going up. Also, one needs to, you know, realize the fact that there are only, you know, so much savings going around, which can be borrowed. And when the government borrows more, there is less for, you know, the private parties to borrow. Now, at this point of time, it may not matter much because the private parties are also not borrowing much. So the state governments will be able to borrow easily. But let's say, you know, six months down the line or a year down the line, you know, once the demonetization effects start to ebb, and the economy starts to grow again, and private sector borrowing picks up, I mean, then we will definitely, you know, have an impact. And, you know, you need to remember that we are still not done with all these wave offs. You know, only four states have waived off loans up until now, now till 2019, many more states are supposed to go to the polls. And every time a state goes to, you know, polls, this will be the major issue. I mean, even if, you know, the BJP does not raise it, the opposition party in that particular state definitely will. I mean, look at, you know, look at Karnataka, which is not really a BJP state right now, it's governed by the Congress, they have already, you know, waived off farm loans worth around"

I mean, at the same level, it's, you know, when you sort of waive off farm loans, you end up spoiling the credit culture. I mean, as Kumar's father's story sort of, you know, explained, yeah."

It's just that, you know, nobody sort of has even bothered to look at them in a serious way. I mean, you know, look at the fact that you have all these retail chains coming up. Now, why shouldn't they be allowed to deal directly with farmers or if not farmers, at least with farmer cooperatives? I mean, that is a solution which brings the farmer closer to the end consumer. And it wouldn't be a monopsony then as, you know, Kumar pointed out. I mean, you know, recently I came across a great story. So for a period of around six months, you know, there has been a farmer's market which happens every Friday close to where I live. And these guys, you know, drive down with their vegetables from as far as, you know, Satara and Pune and Nashik. And these vegetables are very fresh. And normally what happens is the vegetables you get in the normal market are chemically aged. That doesn't happen there. And these farmers are very, you know, they're happy to drive down five hours to sell their stuff because they get a good price for what they produce. So you know, I spoke to some of them and the point that came out was that for the first time they have been able to set a price for what they are producing now, which was a great thing for them. But then this is really not a solution because, you know, driving down five hours every week and you cannot move a lot of green vegetables because by the time they sort of land up in Bombay, they've already gone bad. So ultimately, you know, the solution is to bring the farmer closer to the consumer. And this has to happen in various ways."

In a monopsony, there is only one buyer. So the thing with agriculture here today is there's no free market when it comes to the farmer selling his produce. You can't just go anywhere and set up shop and to any market or give your goods to any supplier. It's all government controlled, it's all area control. You can only sell at a specific place to a specific whatever and as you were just pointing out Vivek, the Maharashtra government, you know, loosened that up a little bit."

So it's not, you know, I mean, this is a solution at a very, very small level. You know, the other point I wanted to make was that, you know, instead of promoting farm loan waivers, we should be promoting crop insurance, which is also, I mean, if you look at data, you know, over the last three years, I think crop insurance as a portion of, you know, what has been farmed, the area that is under, which has been sown is around 26%. Now, this is a very extremely low number, I mean, it's gone up from some 20 to 23% to 26%. Now, crop insurance is something which needs to be, you know, promoted, and farmers need to be made aware of this concept, which is\u2026"

So as you pointed out, Vivek, that it might well be the case now that our fiscal deficit goes up and the government, because it is funding these waivers, has to borrow more. But that also, down the line, affects the borrowing rate for private parties. And if they borrow at a higher rate, that cost is then passed on to consumers. It's just that it's not very clearly measurable. It's not measurable. It's an unseen effect. And at the margins, there might be businesses which don't open up or run at all because of that. So it has an impact all the way down the line. In a sense, it's a negative sum game, you could say. These are the two main unseen effects. Any others that you can think of?"
