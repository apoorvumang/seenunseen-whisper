That tells you from a lamb's point of view, that democracy is not enough. The wolves are going to vote to eat the lamb. Democracy by itself is meaningless unless you have a set of rules to protect every individual. The rules have to state that the wolves may not eat the lamb, no matter how lofty the stated purpose may be. In modern times, we call these rules a constitution. The constitution is a book of rules that protects the rights of lambs by limiting the behavior of wolves. That's right. A constitution should ideally limit what a state can do to its citizens. But this raises a difficult question. What if a popular leader says that, hey, listen, I have the people of this nation with me. Therefore, I am legitimate. This constitution is only legitimate as long as I say so. If I don't agree with some part of it, I will change it. What happens to the lamb then? Is this attitude something we should be worried about in India? Well, 70 years ago, this was the exact position taken by Jawaharlal Nehru."

If you're not the purest of white, you're the blackest of black. This has especially happened since 2014, when Narendra Modi won elections. For members of the tribe of Modi, history ended in 2014. Nothing after that can be discussed and everything is Nehru's fault. For people in the anti-Modi tribe, history began in 2014. We can only talk about the wrong that has happened since then. Before that, India was a golden age and our leaders were saints. Now, this is obviously a ridiculous binary and it affects how we look at history. Consider Nehru, for example, who for one side is a saint and for the other side, a demon. Nehru was a complex man. He was a great leader during the freedom struggle and when he became prime minister of India, he got some things right and he got some things wrong. You can ascribe some of his mistakes to the temper of the times and you can ascribe some of them to his own temperament. Nehru contained multitudes. Similarly, our constitution contains multitudes. You know, people often speak of the constitution as if it is some sort of holy book, but the truth is it's not a book at all. It was a book for just over a year between 1950 and 1951, after which, as one famous cartoon says, it ceased to be a book and became a periodical. Starting with Nehru, it became common that whenever a court called an action by a prime minister unconstitutional, the prime minister just went and changed the constitution. The first amendment came in 1951 and in that, as well as through subsequent amendments like the third, the fourth, the seventh, the 17th, our rights were diluted as the constitution became less and less liberal. No less than the father of the constitution, B. R. Ambedkar, said in 1954, at the time of the fourth amendment, that the constitution had been so degraded that he wanted to burn it. Ambedkar, of course, was in the government at the time of the first amendment, which is such a fascinating period in India's history. The government in power at the time, led by Nehru, realized that the constitution came in the way of much of what they wanted to accomplish. So they set about to amend it. My guest today is a scholar, Tripur Dhaman Singh, who has written an excellent book called 16 Stormy Days, 16 Stormy Days lays out the details of the complex political landscape of those times, showing how so many of the leaders involved, including Nehru, were creatures of circumstance. You could even say they were responding to incentives. I wish every Indian, especially every Indian on Twitter would read this book, because it would give so much nuance to their understanding of Indian politics. One of my big learnings from the book was about our free speech laws. I'm a free speech absolutist, and I've always railed in column after column after column against section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which is a sedition law, as well as 153A and 295A. These are all colonial era laws, they should not exist today, right? Well, as Tripur Dhaman points out, these laws were deemed to be unconstitutional in 1950. But the caveats to free speech added in the first amendment made them constitutional again. That's some of the TIL moments in this superb book and in this episode. Before we get to our conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break. If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the show alive. The Scene and the Unseen has been a labor of love for me. I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours as well. But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show. Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken up to the insane engagement level of podcasts. And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on. So, well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves you. My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support, and contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription. The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Keep this thing going, sceneunseen.in slash support.

And when I was going to university, I kind of really thought hard about, you know, which line to take. And I ended up going with politics. But I found that I, while I did really enjoy the kind of, I studied politics and international relations for my undergraduate degree, and I really enjoyed it. But I always felt that there was, that, I mean, history kind of always had a lot more fascination. I mean, it kind of interested me in a way that sort of political theory and international relations theory didn't. So then I ended up doing a master's in South Asian studies at Cambridge, where I was taken on as a student by Christopher Bailey. And that was a very, that was my first real introduction to historical research. It was kind of eye opening in many ways. It really kind of forced me to broaden the way I think, the way I kind of work. And I think Bailey exercised like quite a great influence on me. And so that's how I ended up, and then because I did quite well, he was like, well, you should think about a PhD. And I, you know, really liked him, I really liked what I did. And that was kind of how I, how I went into it. And progressively, the more, I think the more I read and the more I came across, the more I wanted to read and, you know, the more I wanted to get into the thick of sort of archival action and research. And I think one thing really led to another and you, in the end, you know, that I've kind of ended up doing this as an academic. So, so far, so good, I'd say."

Because that's what I had, you know, 10 years ago, that's what I thought was one of the most fascinating periods of Indian history. It still is. But it was, it was a kind of period of like, real flux. And it's, it's the kind of period, say, someone like William Dalrymple writes about. And some of the things that were kind of happening were just mind boggling. You had, you know, adventurers from Luxembourg setting up, you know, little kingdoms, you had the kind of titular Mughal Empire still kind of soldiering on. There was so much going on. And making sense of how things happened was constantly a sort of challenge. Because I had never, when I did start with history, I'd never studied history academically before, not for my undergraduate, not even for my, you know, final two years of school. So I found the whole process of doing research really fascinating. And I think the 19th century was kind of a very, very interesting period to start with, because it was one I was working with, I mean, possibly one of the greatest historians of his generation. And secondly, it was a kind of project which really needed you to, you know, dig into, you know, quite old archival material. It would take, you know, you would sit through 200-year-old documents. And I found the whole process really fascinating. And that period, because it's even now such a contested sort of time in Indian history, we, it's, I mean, very politically charged to talk about, as you can see now, to talk about, for example, the period which was the, you know, the end of the Mughal Empire and the kind of rise of the British. And so I found, when I started out, I think I had a very, didn't have a very precise idea of where the project would go. But as things developed, there were kind of certain themes which have really kind of stuck with me since. And those include things like the idea of the law, the concept of sovereignty, the, you know, how these sort of kind of small adventurers or small, like, kingdoms set up political entities within the sort of framework of the, you know, of the empire, really. And so I think those themes have kind of stuck with me. And some of them are kind of even reflected in this work on the Constitution, because the idea of law and ideology is kind of laced through this work as well."

One question is that, you know, most of us, when most of us non-historians, when we think of the telling of history, we think of it as, okay, you research a lot of facts, and you build a story around it, and you tell a story. But obviously, for a historian, you are sort of doing many different things. What is the process of doing history per se, as a historian, really like, you have to sort of set aside preconceptions and that you might have or that existing narratives about it. And of course, the hindsight bias, where we already know what happened, but, you know, in the moment, it's never apparent what's going to happen. What are the sort of adjustments you have to make when you actually sit down to the practice of studying and writing history, especially as you say, since you, you know, took it up while, you know, in your post graduation, and you hadn't really studied the formal art of doing history before that?"

We all have certain biases, certain, I wouldn't say preconceptions, but certain ideas about the world, about the past. And I don't think you can start from a blank canvas, but you have to be willing to let your own ideas be challenged, and be willing to kind of take them apart and put them back together again. And I think that's something that is really important, and that's something that I've really learned through the last several years. And I think one of the problems that I first had when I started my, I'd say my work as a historian was my unfamiliarity with kind of the historiographical and methodological tools that we use, because we do more than just tell a story. And facts are always, I mean, facts are never really facts in the way that people often understand them. They have to be contextualized. You have to interrogate your sources, because just because someone's saying something 200 years ago doesn't, you know, their word doesn't necessarily make it true. So you have to be able to read them against the grain. And you have to also think of how the world was at the period that you were writing about. And that's where the kind of, a lot of the kind of theory that we forced to really, not necessarily forced to, but you know, you have to come to terms with it, is sort of different ways of conceptualizing the past. And you have to be willing to, and that's, I feel that's where like most of the grunt work really lies. It's the sort of collection of facts and retelling of facts is the easy part, contextualizing it and interpreting it in sort of in the light of, you know, the broader framework that you're using to assess it or other ideas about the period that you're talking about. That's where the real work lies, because you have to also take on board ideas that other people have, which may be diametrically opposite to yours, and we can't simply ignore them and say, well, I'm going to say this, which I guess you can in, you know, if you're writing as an amateur or if you're, but for something to stand the kind of, stand the scrutiny of your peers, it has to be willing to take on board a lot of ideas that you don't necessarily agree with. And I think that's one of the major, major differences between having a kind of, not necessarily academic, but I'd say a professional historian versus a kind of raconteur of stories."

And obviously, as you said, none of us are blank slates going into looking at whatever we're looking at. So how much of this sort of framework was influenced by your studies of political science? For example, you mentioned about how, you know, in your earlier book, you were interested in ideas of sovereignty and law and so on and so forth. And, you know, even in this book, there's a very, you know, a crisp, cogent, very lucid understanding of, you know, constitutionalism and liberalism and sort of the central fault lines of that period, which is, of course, the political imperatives of the Congress party and Nehru versus a constitutional project that they had embarked upon, which is, you know, a very clear line and yet a frame that I haven't seen many other people who write about that period use at all. So how important was all of that political science training in defining sort of the way you look at history? And do you think that that's something that all historians sort of carry with them, that the frame also matters?

It's something that people are very unfamiliar with and something that affects everybody's life quite intimately in ways that, you know, we don't often acknowledge. And for that reason, I tried to keep things as lucid, as crisp, as sort of easy to access as I could. And that's because I was writing for an audience that may not necessarily be invested in history in the same way as I would have written it if I was writing, you know, for Oxford University Press. And I think that that kind of makes a huge difference. As far as my sort of background in politics goes, it was, I think it gave me a good, it's given me a good kind of basic idea of the kind of ideological elements that come into being as well as the, I'd say, a sort of historical background of many of these ideas such as liberalism or constitutionalism. And I think looking back, it's probably been quite helpful because I can perhaps talk about both sides of the story with what I hope is like relative clarity.

And there are some books which really are very, very interesting, but then they're also written in a kind of way that makes them quite dull to read. And I'd read them through because of the level of interest that I have in it, but someone else might not. And I think my thought always was that anyone with a slight interest in history or politics should be able to pick this book up and be able to read it, no matter whether they're like 16 or whether they're 60, and be able to make sense of it because it's not the easiest subject to talk about. But on the other hand, it's hugely important. And I think that's part and parcel of a historian's craft is to, especially if you're writing about something that has such a huge bearing on the contemporary world, to make your material accessible to a wide audience. And I think one of the ideas, and this is like what I once watched, well, I watched the film a long time ago, but I once read a review of the old Hindi film Dhundh, which is from the 1970s. And the reviewer wrote, one of the reasons that he really loved the film was that he was like, yeah, the action moves at the pace of a gunshot. And that's something that's always struck with me, is you shouldn't make things more complicated than they are, and you shouldn't unnecessarily pad out what you want to say. So if it can be said in a kind of way that keeps the narrative flowing quickly, and it can be said in a way that is, you know, clear and accessible, then that's what you should"

The other thing that struck me was, like you said, it's a hugely important book, and we'll come to that when we discuss the book, but it also struck me that the writing of it at this time is also surely something that you must have thought twice about, because, you know, doing history means you're embracing nuance, you know, as you have done in this book. But modern politics, especially in the last few years, is really the stripping away of nuance and history has almost been weaponized. And you know, we've created all these stark binaries through which we look at history, where for one side, you know, Nehru is all black, and for the other side, Nehru is all white, and there's no other way of looking at it. And similarly, you know, figures like Shama Prasad Mukherjee, and all of those, you know, there are many people today who purport on the one hand to support the Congress, but on the other hand, they treat the Constitution almost as a holy book. I mean, you know, sometimes they will say in response to an argument, but that is unconstitutional as if that is automatically the end of the argument, and you don't need to say anything about it. While the reality, of course, is that, you know, as that old cartoon goes, the Constitution is less of a book and more of a periodical, you know, Nehru, in fact, was in the habit of every time something he did was deemed unconstitutional. He simply amended the Constitution, not just in the First Amendment, as you write about, but the fourth, the seventh, the 17th, which went to Parliament just before he died, he sort of did this repeatedly. So you know, you would have known when you began this book that this was sort of, you know, not fitting in these polarized times, it would just be, you know, it would not be an easy project to do. What did you think about it in that sense? Like, did that increase the urgency of doing the book that, you know, something needs to counter the prevailing narratives, or is it something that made you think twice?"

And it is, yeah, it's a story that needs nuance, but equally, it's something that really sort of has the potential to throw things a bit off kilter. And yes, I knew when I wrote it that it, when I was writing it, that it has the potential to be used as a kind of political tool in the current climate. But of course, I finished writing it before the kind of, you know, the protests over the CAA, etc. happened, which really brought the Constitution suddenly back into public debate. So it wasn't expressly written with the intent of being a kind of intervention in the debates of today. But I was well aware that it is something that impinges quite heavily on today's world. And the thing is, nobody comes out of it looking like you would expect. So it has potential to be, I guess, used as a kind of intellectual weapon.

And also, you know, for the human aspects of it, you know, you've kind of made all of these people, Nehru, Patel, Mukherjee, and so on, so much more three dimensional than we otherwise knew of them. And you know, just as you bring the lens of politics and political science, rather, in your telling of history, I kind of, you know, invoke economics in my podcast a lot. So as I was reading this book, it kind of, you know, confirmed my sense of how incentives shape actions and shape behavior. And I had a question for you on that, because one of the interesting things that you've pointed out, and it's like a strand through the book, and it's endlessly fascinating is, you know, and we'll discuss the book in detail, the context and everything that happened. But one of the strands that really struck me was that at the time of the first amendment being carried out, you know, Raja ji and Ambedkar were both part of the establishment. And they played a part in actually getting many of these amendments through Raja ji, the sort of the anti free speech parts of it, and Ambedkar, all the rest of it. And they were in government, and they were all for it. And yet, after they are in government, as you pointed out, Ambedkar actually represented the zamindars against the very act that he had helped bring about. And similarly, Raja ji goes on to form the Swatantra party and become a beacon of liberalism, while they're acting while in government is contrary to that. And it sort of struck me about that old truism of Lord Acton that power corrupts. And it strikes me that their behavior is actually entirely natural. If you consider the incentives that if you're part of the executive, that arm of government, you will obviously be drawn to actions that strengthen the part of the government which you are part of. You might not think of it like that. But that's pretty much what you'll be drawn to. So to me, it's not so much of a contradiction that when they were part of the government, they behaved in a way that would stand in their arm of government. And then once they are out of it, they can go back to talking about principles and you know, similarly, Nehru much earlier before he became Prime Minister warned of his own dictatorial tendencies. And yet when he became a Prime Minister, you know, he ignored the warnings of his past self, in a way, now, you've obviously, you know, studied that period and these people much more than me. So what is your sense of this that to what extent can they be and unconsciously, of course, not, you know, justifying it in these terms, but to what extent are they actually responding to incentives and can be read as creatures of their circumstances?"

And there is, I never quite point out, I mean, I never hint that they were, for example, somehow inherently evil, or like somehow inherently, you know, their moral compass was corrupted. They were obviously responding to the situation as they saw it. But the incentives part, how I put it is that they have, I think, part of it is to do with the fact that they were quite, as you know, Patel once, I pointed out at some point in the book where Patel tells Nehru, you know, this is the result of idealistic exuberance. And I think the idealism had a major role to play somewhere, because they just passed the Constitution, they had, you know, all of these grand ambitions, and they either thought of themselves as kind of above these kind of despotic tendencies, or as people who would, you know, wield them with the idea of utmost benevolence. And that is, I feel, one major aspect of why they did what they did. Secondly, there was, of course, the incentive, and the incentive was driven also by the fact that they were the only organized political force that there was. So there was no real incentive to take on board the views of the opposition or the warnings, you know, issued by, you know, figures like Mukherjee or Kripalani or people like that, because there was the idea that they would somehow, at some point, have to face the same tools that they were crafting was just so far-fetched. And I think that probably made it easy enough to contemplate these measures that I think they probably would not have if there had been any real political organization with the standing to challenge the Congress. And I think that was one major incentive. I think the other, again, and this is, I think, quite common to most democracies, is that the incentive, if possible, to take shortcuts to gain political benefit is always there. And a lot of these people quite clearly succumb to it."

The party was as committed to denying every other group or party a seat at the political high table as it was to gaining control of the levers of power. As a self-declared representative of the nation, the Congress laid claim to possession of the colonial state and all its territory. With the advent of democracy and the inauguration of the Constitution, this position, incompatible with any idea of constitutional democracy, was strained to breaking point when its collectivist mirrorings and its intolerance of opposing ideologies clashed with an expansively liberal Constitution. The Congress Party, instead of defending the normative foundations of democracy and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, instinctively turned on its own creation.\" So give me a sense of, you know, in your book, what you've done an excellent job is of laying out the context of that immediate period between, you know, 26 Jan 1950, when the Constitution comes into being and, and then the First Amendment 14 months later, but give me a broader sense of the context of these times as we, you know, come into this that what is a Congress's approach and my sense in us, in a way was that, you know, people like Nehru and Patel and whatever, when they spoke so highly of the fundamental rights and all of that earlier, were in a sense doing what we would today call virtue signaling. But when they realized that the, that it would impact their ability to do all the things that they wanted to do, which the Congress was predicated upon, because the whole Congress's platform was social change and a certain kind of progressive progressivism, which then those fundamental rights got in the way of. So, you know, how was all of that sort of playing out? Was this clash between fundamental rights and politics kind of inevitable in the way the last few years shaped up or, you know, was it sort of contingent upon the circumstance of Nehru being the person who happened to be the Prime Minister?"

        "message": "What is your sense of that? A quick word about that quote, though, so that's a whole school of Indian history would kind of subscribe to that view. And I think I referenced that to Sunil Khillani. But of course, there are also others like Barry Anderson, etc. And it's so partition, for example, was something that was framed in Congress circles as a price that they had to pay to have a centralized state under their own control. And that kind of reflects, again, I said, I think it kind of testifies to the idea that I think that the Congress was quite committed to a centralized state under its own control. And I mean, one of the sticking points throughout the 1930s and 1940s in Indian politics is the Congress demand to be taken for, you know, the Congress demand for the British to consider it the sole representative of the nation. And ultimately, that's what becomes a stumbling block. It becomes a stumbling block in the 40s with the rise of the Muslim League because it becomes a position that's completely untenable. You know, once the Muslim League wins the majority of Muslim seats, it becomes quite apparent that the Congress doesn't represent the entirety of the nation because they lose quite badly in the Muslim seats. And that kind of idea still, but the idea doesn't really die because the thing is, it's thought that that problem has been overcome, or at least sidelined with partition. And so once the exercise to, you know, write the Constitution, etc., begins, you have token representation of other groups. And I think it's done with the idea that, you know, you give the impression that it's a very representative assembly. But as people never tire of pointing out, even during the Constituent Assembly debates, it's essentially a one-party body in a one-party country. There is no other party. And the party that dominates the Constituent Assembly also holds the levers of executive power. And once the Constitution comes into force, and everyone knows that an election is going to be held, it also creates a kind of incentive for people who are already, you know, in the Constituent Assembly, and to kind of toe the orders that come from Nehru and Patel, because a lot of them want to be re-elected. And the only way that they will get their nominations is if they keep the party bosses content. And so that's, again, contemporary sort of articles in the press speak about this openly. And then, of course, you also have the kind of decline of Sardar Patel, because he's, by the mid-1950s, he's actually bedridden for most of the time. And he passes away in 1950. And by then, Nehru is already more or less ascendant. I talk about it at some point in the book with the Nasik Congress, where in Patel's absence, you know, Nehru kind of has his own way. And eventually, after Patel's death, really, you have a system where Nehru is such a political colossus that there is no one really in the cabinet who can, you know, stand up to him or put forward a strong alternative position. Nehru's biographer Sarvapalli Gopal, who is actually very sympathetic to Nehru, you know, calls it a sort of collection of mouldering mediocrities. And so the context is that the political capital that Nehru brings to bear, much like today, ensures that he is capable of getting his own way. And I think I make a reasonably strong case in the book for arguing that much of it is driven by Nehru's own personal investment in these policies, rather than any sort of great pressure from the states, because he resists the pressure for things that he kind of feels very strongly about. And on the other side, equally, you have figures like S. P. Mukherjee or H. N. Kundzor, or even Kriplani, who then resigns from the Congress. They're very articulate, they're very good at, you know, the sort of ins and outs of parliamentary debate. But unfortunately, no one has the kind of political organisation or the public standing to mount a significant challenge. And I think that's a kind of interesting thing to note, because it has so many contemporary echoes the way like we sort of conceptualise today."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean, those contemporary echoes are, you know, sort of echoed as it were, throughout my reading of the book, when, you know, because in our modern times as well, we seem to have a single party which is utterly dominant, as it was then, we have a larger than life figure in charge of that party. You know, you just repeated a quote about the quality of Nehru's cabinet and a similar thing could possibly be said about this one about, you know, how eminences like Arun Shourie for example, were just sidelined in 2014. And you've got a much weaker cabinet than you could have. And equally, you have worries about the constitution about how it's been degraded and sort of made meaningless and how that particular arm of the state is being strengthened as compared to the others. Though those, you know, one could argue today that hey, the constitutions was already degraded that you talk of the, you know, I'm struck by something Kapil Komeredi said on Twitter, where somebody was complaining about the murder of democracy when these recent farm bills were passed the way they were, which was a murder of democracy. But as Kapil pointed out, it was not just murder, it was also mimicry, because it's all happened before. And your book is very instructive in that regard. And you know, I used to often joke about how, you know, despite blaming Nehru for everything, Modi is actually, you know, a mimic in many ways. I mean, and what I mainly meant was the whole central planning top down approach of the economy. But even with the approach towards power, the approach to the constitution, it's extremely similar. So tell me a little bit about what Nehru's imperatives and his incentives at the time were because he came in like 1950 is when the constitution is there, he is aware that he is part of a government which hasn't yet got a popular mandate. It's a transitionary government in that sense, he needs a popular mandate. Part of that mandate rests on fulfilling the promises he has made. Those promises include the zamindari reforms and, you know, reservations and so on and so forth, the whole social, progressive element of it. And suddenly he finds that this constitution is in the way, you know, what the hell is going on? Tell me a little bit about sort of, you know, what are his imperatives and how is he responding"

        "message": "to them? I think there are several actually. So one of course is the fact that Nehru is, especially with zamindari abolition, that's a policy that Nehru is personally invested in and personally identified with. So the Congress Party runs a tremendous sort of public contact program really for zamindari abolition. I think in UP alone there were like 35,000 public meetings. Probably Bihar had a similar number. And so there's a lot of political capital that's being invested in this and, you know, from the top to the bottom, from, you know, small-time leaders like district presidents to more senior figures such as, well, Nehru himself, but also figures like Charan Singh and C.B. Gupta, et cetera, who are very, very both vocal and kind of committed to a particular form of zamindari abolition and land reform. And of course, the Congress having acquired the levers of power is also a bit, I think the easiest way to describe it would be suffering from a slight hangover of the Raj because it's hard to convince the public that having gotten rid of one set of rulers, the other set of rulers do not have similar powers or are constrained by notions of constitutionalism or legality. So when the kind of first judgment, which is the staying of the Bihar Act, happens, it comes as a huge shock, not only because it kind of takes a sort of sledgehammer to their political capital because it shows everyone that their word is not infallible, but also because it's something that has been discussed over and over again within the Constituent Assembly. And it was something, the right to property is something that had been debated extensively in past as a form of compromise between those who were kind of votaries of a strong right to private property and those who felt that it would come in the way of zamindari and land reform. So this was something that had not been really considered possible. Zamindari abolition had been considered a done deal and plenty of Congress figures are on record saying this is going to happen regardless of anything else, such as constitution or no constitution, this zamindari abolition will come into place. So once they realize that it can't, it kind of leads to a sort of real shockwave within the Congress party and many suspect that with the money and the sort of local power that many of the zamindars have and can bring to bear, that the forthcoming election is something to be really thought about because from the other side, and there are zamindari parties which are in the fray and many of them are quite confident about being able to take on the Congress. So that's another thing that Nehru is acutely conscious of, that going back to the people without fulfilling what he has personally promised would amount to a kind of betrayal. And he says this in several letters to his chief ministers and to his colleagues that it's something that he doesn't want to countenance. Equally it's also something that state chief ministers do not want to countenance and Bihar definitely doesn't want to countenance that and they become like the first sort of people to demand a constitutional amendment to pass their law. There's of course a kind of longer story connected to that law, which is that Bihar law is a the only one that is found to be unconstitutional, unlike similar laws in UP and later in Maharashtra. The Bihar law is basically held to be unconstitutional on a technicality, not because it violates the right to property but because it violates the right to equality. And so no one honestly believes that zamindari abolition is under such serious threat that"

Just to sort of get into the weeds and summarize briefly and you can tell me if I'm summarizing it correctly. You know, it was of course challenged on the grounds of both the right to property and the right to equality but the high court when striking it down in Bihar invoked the right to equality per se because, you know, they were giving unequal compensation to the zamindars in the sense that the small zamindars were getting up to 20 times their annual revenues while others were getting eight times and some of the big biggest ones were getting three times or something like that and you know which they felt infringed the right to equality.

And like you pointed out, you know, everyone was saying that nowhere have the courts actually said that zamindari reforms are an issue or land redistribution is an issue. It's very easy to be within the constitution and just revert the law a little bit to take care of these, but Nehru doesn't care to do that. So this is one of the fault lines.

So obviously the Bombay High Court doesn't buy the government's contention that the constitution doesn't have retrospective effect or that law predates the constitution. And they're let loose. And of course, that's the kind of one of the first cases that brings, you know, fundamental rights into play. But then there's a kind of bigger question, which comes up after the shootings of the detainees in Salem in cold blood, because there is a kind of, there's a left-leaning magazine called Crossroads run by the young Romesh Thapar, who is coincidentally the brother of the famous historian Romila Thapar. But so Romesh Thapar's magazine, you know, eviscerates Nehru and the Congress and it ends up getting banned in the Madras province. And Thapar, of course, is not one to take it lying down. He launches a collection, his readers sort of contribute to the effort and eventually a petition is filed in the Supreme Court, arguing that the ban is unconstitutional. And this is, it's mirrored on the other side in Delhi, where a precensorship order is served against the organizer, which is the weekly news magazine of the RSS. And essentially the reason the government is upset with them is that they have been criticizing the Nehru government's policies towards Pakistan in the context of what's been happening in Bengal. Bengal had been seeing a lot of communal violence, triggered mainly by a sort of state-sponsored, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily call it a kind of genocide, but sort of state-sponsored communal attrition really in East Pakistan, which had led to a lot of refugees crossing over and obviously retaliatory violence in West Bengal. So Nehru had been trying to essentially work out a kind of agreement with Liaqat Ali Khan on how they would stem the tide of the refugees. And Nehru's peace overtures to Pakistan were heavily criticized in Bengal. They were very unpopular and, I mean, as expected, they were also very unpopular with the Hindu right, with the RSS. And so the RSS news magazine was criticizing him heavily. Many right-leaning public figures such as Mukherjee and, you know, someone like the Hindu Mahasabha leader, Mahant Digvijayanath, were kind of clamoring for some sort of stern action against Pakistan. And this kind of demand for stern action saw wide echo everywhere, even within the Congress Party. There are letters from Nehru who suspects that this kind of viewpoint is being encouraged by Patel. And so finally he kind of demands action, and obviously action is taken and a pre-censorship order is passed. And the Brij Bhushan, who's the sort of printer and publisher of the organized NKR Malkani, who's then the editor, again take the matter up to the Supreme Court and a kind of petition is filed. And both cases are heard kind of concurrently in the Supreme Court, which finally gives out its judgment in May, and they're both now quite well-known cases, Brij Bhushan versus the state of Delhi and Ramesh Thapar versus the state of Madras. And the court's judgment basically lays out quite clearly that the ability of the state to abridge the right to free speech was limited to the exceptions that had already been written into the Constitution, which were libel, slander, defamation, contempt of court, or undermining the security of the state. But the undermining of the security of the state had to create, essentially was quite a high standard. It had to be undermined to the extent where disorder was of such a magnitude that it imperiled the security of the state or it had the potential to overthrow the state. And obviously, this did not reach that standard. So the court not only countermanded both orders, it also held the relevant parts of the legislations that we use, the Public Safety and Public Security Acts, to be ultra-virus. And that kind of really threw the government's point off because Patel obviously, as he told Nehru, it kind of knocks the bottom line out of our ability to really control the press. But for Nehru, it was an even bigger problem because he thought that this was something being done to undermine his peace over Church Pakistan or to, in a way, for example, he writes to Raj Gopalchari and he tells him, all of this is propaganda to try and push and bully me into war. And it's a war that he doesn't want to have. And it's curious to note that this is a demand that is also made within certain sections of the Congress Party and his government. Because eventually when his finance minister, John Mathai, resigns, John Mathai becomes one of the first people really to publicly describe Nehru's policies towards Pakistan as appeasement. And he becomes the kind of first, one of the first users of that term. And for Nehru, this sort of criticism of his Pakistan policy, he sees it as effectively a tool being used to undermine his overture to Pakistan. He suspects that there is support for that position within the Congress. He, as I note in the book, he berates Patel, telling him that his actions haven't been enough. And I quote, Nehru obviously writes to Patel, not completely satisfied with what is going on. I think we have taken up far too lenient an attitude towards those in India who encourage this communal feeling of hatred and violence. The Hindu Mahasabha talks about Akhand Bharat, which is a direct incentive to conflict. The belief that retaliation is a suitable method to deal with Pakistan or what happens in Pakistan is growing. That is the surest way to ruin for India and Pakistan. And just, I mean, even Patel, who has self-confessedly been deferring to Nehru on this matter, is kind of taken aback by Nehru's criticism. And he notes, again, I quote, action has been circumscribed only by the provisions of the law as interpreted by legal advisors and the high courts. We put thousands in jail and adopted a policy of release only after we were continually attacked on the score of maintaining civil liberties. And then he reminds Nehru, we are now faced with a constitution which guarantees fundamental rights, right of association, right of free movement, free expression and personal liberty, which further circumscribe the action we can take. That means that for every executive action, there must be legal justification. If within these limits, you feel that our policy towards communal organizations has been lenient, steps can certainly be taken in the manner you may suggest. So we, I mean, this exchange is a kind of good indication of how seriously this sort of criticism of his Pakistan policy was affecting Nehru or how, indeed, how determined he was to find a way to kind of, if not, you know, crush it, at least to, at least to really smother it as, as far as he could. And then of course, the second point of pain was the question of reservations, which had."

And I was, my jaw dropped open when I saw how fast the courts actually worked in that time. Like you point out that, you know, the constitution is, it comes on January 26, 1950. On Feb 6, these communist detainees in Bombay file a case and they are freed on Feb 8, in two days they are free. And on Feb 11, the other communist detainees in Salem start their whole thing, which ends with, you know, the deaths of the 22 people. And that gets a crossroads to sort of, you know, write about that and Nehru defends the state action. At which point I was struck by this quote by Jayaprakash Narayan. And if you forget who is talking about who, there are echoes of this, which reverberate to this time where Jayaprakash Narayan says of Nehru, quote, the prime minister of India talked in the language of dictators when he maintained that we had to choose between security of the state and freedom of the individual, we must choose the former, stop quote. And later on, KR Malkani, the editor of The Organizer, which is ERSS mag, which, you know, defends the case against the pre-censorship order against it, he writes, quote, to threaten the liberty of the press for the sole offense of non-conformity to official view in each and every matter may be a handy tool for tyrants, but is only a crippling curtailment of civil liberties in a free democracy. A government can always learn more from bona fide criticism of independent thinking citizens than the fulsome flattery of charlatans, stop quote.

They criticize them for being heavy handed, for trampling on civil liberties, for not taking oppositional views on board, for encouraging ideological conformity. And they criticize them using a kind of terminology that we would now recognize as quite distinctly liberal. So, respect for individual freedom, respect for the right to free speech, tolerance of dissent and criticism. These are profoundly, profoundly liberal virtues. And this argument is made by K. R. Malkani in his columns. This argument is made by N. C. Chatterjee, who again, by the way, is a former Hindu Mahasabha stalwart in his submissions in court. And this argument is made by Shyamaprasad Mukherjee in his interventions in Parliament. And all sort of frame their arguments in these terms. Now, there is, I'm sure a lot of people would say that that's just what was expedient at the time. And this is just a matter of kind of using the constitutional defenses that you have to have your own way. And that's perfectly, I'm sure there was an element of that. But equally, it to me looks like a kind of distinct liberal tradition, because you have all the kind of, both the political element of it, and the kind of, how should I put it, the ideological element, because for want of a better word, I mean, the organizer does represent the official viewpoint of the RSS. And what comes across to me is a kind of element of liberal thought, which should realistically have been nourished and encouraged, rather than clamped down on. And that's, I think, one of the more unfortunate parts of the whole story of the First Amendment is the fact that this sort of narrow dispensation is willing to countenance the use of distinctly illiberal legal and constitutional tools to clamp down on a kind of ideological position that, while kind of discredited in the Narrowvian era, did nevertheless consistently enjoy a sort of reasonable modicum of public support. And I think that's something that as a statesman, he should have seen through, or should, I mean, it's a kind of tradition that I feel should have been encouraged. Obviously, it's a kind of tradition that is lost because the ideological and political successes of these people who are now, I mean, if you ever go to, if you ever see the inside of a BJP office, you will always have a huge portrait of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee. But even within that stream of thought, people have really forgotten or maybe deliberately ignored the fact that Mukherjee was not the kind of bigoted authoritarian figure that people might imagine him to be. He was, in many ways, a sort of textbook case of classical liberalism. So that again, that's again, a very, very interesting part of the story with tremendous contemporary relevance."

And here also, it strikes me that like one thing which is, you know, I think certainly true is that it's very easy to appear virtuous in opposition, because you can say whatever, but you know, you can do all the signaling in the right way. It's like, we don't even have to go as far back as Shyam Prasad. Even pre the 2014 elections, you know, Narendra Modi was making a lot of noises which would please liberals, especially about downsizing government, minimum government, maximum governance and the government has no business to be in business and all of those things. And obviously, his actions have gone in the opposite direction. But he was making a lot of noises even, you know, Salman's source of the Congress was on my show. And he said that even he approved of a lot of the rhetoric. So when Modi came to power, even Salman in the Congress was cautiously optimistic that he'll actually deliver on some of those things. But the imperatives of actually being in government seemed to me to be quite different from the imperatives of, you know, being in opposition, for example, you know, when you are in that position of responsibility, where you have to sort of juggle 100 different things and, you know, and actually get things done, is there then a battle between pragmatism and principles which plays out where, you know, a Sardar Patel can say that it is okay for you to say whatever you want sitting where you are, but I have the responsibility of being the Home Minister and therefore security does matter. And you can leave your security freedom debate elsewhere, but I have to keep the country together. And these are, of course, in the fraught times after there has been so much trouble bringing the country together in the first place. So is that always a constant tussle where those who are in the opposition will always seem more virtuous than those in the government because you are judging those in the government by their actions, while you're judging those in opposition by their words?"

And the reason that comes through with the kind of internal opposition that is triggered within the Congress Party and that comes from the sort of indications that things are not, obviously there's often a gap between the ideals that, you know, nations and governments and political parties profess and the imperatives of government. But that things are not really going as had been imagined, that there are plenty of indications to it. Those indications come from the speaker at some point where he writes to Nehru, for example, to say, you know, express his disapproval of the frequent recourse to the use of presidential ordinances. It comes from sort of dissident congressmen, like figures like Acharya Kriplani. Now, of course, people can make the case that, you know, Kriplani was upset because he hadn't been made a minister and he hadn't, you know, won the election to the Congress presidency and he was kind of sidelined.

But if we are to kind of constantly simply assume an ulterior motive or a motive driven solely by realpolitik, I think that would also be a bit unfair.

And in truth, we can never really have a firm answer to that question. But there are plenty of indications that even within the Congress, there was disquiet at the way things were being done. And you get that from quite senior, quite pivotal figures, from Rajendra Prasad, from Acharya Kriplani, from G. V. Mavlankar, and indeed from some dissidents who kind of speak up during the debate. And some of the things that are often said both by Nehru and by other figures within the Congress establishment would, I mean, quite shocking, at least surprising if not shocking to read because, I mean, you have figures like Hare Krishna Mehta who basically tells Nehru that the real culprits are actually things such as the right to equality itself, which shouldn't be there. So there is a kind of disquiet within the Congress which would, I think, give some credence at least or at least some reason for us to give figures such as Mukherjee a kind of, if not 100% of our indulgence, at least, you know, 50% of our indulgence."

I'm chatting with the historian Tripudaman Singh about his fabulous book where the narrative goes as fast as a bullet, 16 Stormy Days. And you know, while Tripudaman's book, the narrative does go as fast as a bullet, my show is a little bit more leisurely, which is why we have reached the break and we have only finished two of the three fault lines that kind of led to the first amendment being felt necessary by Jawaharlal Nehru. Two of them to quickly recap are, of course, that he wanted to enact zamindari reforms and that was struck down by the Bihar High Court and was, you know, there was litigation in other places and the Bihar High Court struck it down on the grounds of the right to equality, but it was also sort of challenged on the right to property. And even though experts felt that you could have redrafted those laws and got them through and made them constitutional, Nehru was a man in a hurry. The second, of course, is the free speech laws. Now we think of Article 19.1, I certainly do, as, you know, being, you know, the opposite of the pristine First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which sanctifies free speech, but in this particular case, it has a bunch of caveats. And the interesting thing is that the original constitution enacted on 26 Jan 1950 had some of these caveats, but the First Amendment brought in a bunch more like public order and so on, which can be left open to the interpretation of governments. And there was a fault line there because he tried, he banned Crossroads, which was a communist magazine, and he tried to impose pre-censorship on the organizer, the RSS magazine. Both of those fine parties went to court and the law moved a little bit quicker than it does today, and both of them won. So Nehru's also now thinking, okay, not just right to property, not just right to equality, there's also right to free speech. Where's the third fault line to put them and tell me a bit about how that came about?"

Just, I mean, just before I move on to that, a quick kind of detour back to what we were talking about was, I think, when I mentioned that there was disquiet within the kind of Congress establishment as well, I think the most important indication of this, as early as April 1950, comes from Sardar Patel, whose letter to Nehru I quoted, where he, you know, kind of reminds him of the fact that whatever they have to do has to be within constitutional bounds. And now Patel is quite ambivalent about his commitment to expansive free speech, and he obviously tells, he once does note to Nehru that they will have to consider amendments to the constitution at some point, or that the right to free speech was the result of idealistic exuberance. But Patel's letter is also a kind of, its tone is very sarcastic. It notes things which, I mean, it's basically telling Nehru things that, you know, you would expect a grade six student studying civics to know. And so I would see that as a kind of indication that even Patel did somewhere think that what Nehru was asking him to do was to essentially set aside constitutional bounds and contemplate action that would quite clearly breach constitutional norms. So I think knowing that we have to be willing to give some benefit of the doubt to figures like Malkani and Mukherjee, obviously, we can't, we can never quite know what they would have done in government, but we can give them some benefit of the doubt to say that the position that they were taking up were not simply the result of real politics, but also of some sort of ideological conviction."

But I mean, there are complex currents in the affairs of men. So, you know, people do things for multifactorial reasons, many of which they themselves might not be aware of. So while I think in general, we should take people at face value unless we have reason to believe otherwise. And at the same time, as a friend of mine, like saying, assume goodwill. So, you know, there's no reason to do otherwise with either Malkani or Shyamaprasad Mukherjee or Jayaprakash Narayan or, you know, any of the eminences who kind of oppose the amendment. And while we are on the subject, I'll quickly quote from your book to show what a wide range of opposition there was to Nehru at this time, where you write, quote, Hindu nationalists like S.P. Mukherjee and M.R. Jaikar, Gandhian stalwarts like Acharya Kripalani, committed socialists like Shibbanlal Saxena and Jayaprakash Narayan, conscientious Congress rebels like H.V. Kamant, Svanandan Sahay and K.K. Bhattacharya, jurists like Pranath Mehra and M.C. Chagla, press associations, editors, lawyers and businessmen, men whose ideological and editorial successes today might scarcely believe, but would do well to remember that their predecessors held the views they did, stop quote. And while you brought Patel in, I was also kind of, you know, before we get to the sort of the third fault line, I was also struck by a quote about Nehru and Patel, which I thought I'll ask you about later. But as we are on the subject now, where you wrote, quote, their commitment to civil liberties and individual freedom or the lack thereof represented a rare consensus between the two giants of Indian politics, stop quote, who would have thunk. And I guess their skepticism towards fundamental rights, which, you know, as you pointed out, you know, Patel at one point said reflected quote, idealistic exuberance, I guess, would have come for different reasons. For Patel, it would have been that look, I have a tough job to do, the security at stake there is, you know, we take the nation for granted today at the time Patel was Home Minister, he had just managed to cobble it together, almost in a new act of imperialism as it were. And the priority was to hold it together and the rights were in the way. While for Nehru, to be honest, he had been consistent all his political life about his values being social progressivism and all of the things that went along with that, like Zamindari reforms and so on. And again, the constitution was sort of an impediment to that. Is that sort of a correct characterization that they were coming from a different place, which was, you know, and the constitution was a separate thing. Today we talk about the constitution and the values it embodies as almost holy and sacramental, but in those tumultuous times, it would not have had the place it did, even in the minds"

I mean, there was a kind of sense of consensus between them on the constitution, but they did approach it, as you rightly point out, from different angles. And perhaps, yes, it didn't really have the kind of same sense of sanctity that it seems to have now, at least, I mean, I'm not sure how much sanctity it really has, but at least in the public mind, that kind of sanctity attaches to it. But it's interesting to note that when the constitution first comes into force, everyone gives a statement saying, yes, you know, we have to maintain the sanctity of the constitution, et cetera, et cetera. But on the other hand, when the amendment finally reaches parliament and it's criticized for the fact that it's being amended so soon without a general election, you know, by an unelected body, Nehru makes a kind of response by saying that since we were competent to make it, we should be competent to amend it as well. And I think that kind of just supports what you said, really, that they saw it as almost as something that was there as a kind of vehicle towards a particular end, perhaps rather than an end in itself. And that end, nobody was quite sure of, because for Nehru that end represented a kind of particular kind of social progressivism. For others, it represented a kind of, I think, especially for Rajendra Prasad, it represented a kind of stable property order. And for quite others, it represented a kind of liberal democracy as they had come to expect by looking at what had happened in Europe and America. And so nobody, I think, because there was no real kind of consensus on what exactly the end was, people saw it as a vehicle towards a particular end, but they didn't quite agree"

        "message": "on what that end really was. So can I ask you a broader question now that I'd actually save for the end, but again, we are sort of on the subject, which is, I mean, two broader questions, really. And the first one is about just this notion of what India should be, sort of the competing early ideas of India, which can even merge into one idea of India, you know, as you've shown in your book, they can mean different things. And one is, of course, the sort of democracy Nehru had in mind, which would aim at a particular kind of social equality and social justice, and so on, and all of those things. And at the same time, a constitutional republic, where you would be bound by certain rules of the game, which would constrain the behavior of the state and, you know, circumscribe what the state could do to its citizens. And it seems to me that at the heart of this, there is an inherent contradiction. And that contradiction has very much to do with, you know, how you think of means versus ends. While where Nehru's thinking was that, look, my ends are that these are the things I want to achieve. And these are my means of doing so. And one could, you know, even argue that even those means are flawed, because they are based on top down thinking, and they didn't actually get anywhere. But regardless, that could be his way of looking at it, while the constitutional way of thinking would be that the means are everything, that you have to protect individual rights, you have to respect individual autonomy, the citizen is a master of the state and not the other way around. And that's where all the fundamental rights come up. So do you think that there is, and to me, it seems that, you know, your book describes a period of time where the people in power are at the heart of this conflict, and they are choosing their democratic ends over constitutional means. And to do this, they're completely subverting the constitution. I mean, I really think we, you know, as your book kind of makes explicit, we had a real liberal constitution for perhaps 14 months of our history. And after that, we didn't, it's a periodical and whoever is in power does whatever the hell they want with it. So to your end, is this a tragic outcome that the two went in different directions? Or is that conflict something that simply cannot be negotiated? It's just, you know, between being a democracy, what the popular will of the people is and constitutional values per se."

        "message": "I mean, I think, but at some level, that conflict is kind of inherent in any sort of democratic setup, because the temptation to do certain things or to kind of take shortcuts is always there. And one of the arguments that's often deployed is that, you know, part and parcel of a democratic system is to reflect the will of the people. And Nehru deploys this argument, I think, in a flawed manner, because obviously there has been no democratic mandate yet by, you know, saying that the legislature has to decide on matters of social policy and wherever the constitution comes in the way of the will of the people, then obviously the constitution has to give way. So I don't think you can completely avoid that conflict anywhere. But the answers that you reach or the sort of mechanisms that are devised to mediate that conflict, I mean, ultimately that's where all of the action is. And Nehru's view very much is of a kind that one would, you know, for example, expect somewhere in somewhere like Britain, where parliamentary sovereignty is kind of expansive and there is no written constitution. So whatever parliament does is, you know, ipso facto that it is constitutional, whereas a written constitution by its very nature is meant to contain and circumscribe the actions of the branches of government or the branches of the state, rather. And that's kind of, I recently read political theorist Madhav Khosla's book on the constitution. And again, that's one of the arguments that he makes is that one of the reasons that the constitution is so lengthy was because they didn't simply want to delineate general principles, but to kind of contain and guide the actions of future legislators, judges and politicians in a particular direction. And that's one of the reasons why the constitution goes into so much detail. And it's a point that Mukherjee makes repeatedly when the amendment is introduced into parliament, saying that the very fact that if this is what we wanted to do, then we should not have had a written constitution in the first place. Having a written constitution, especially one as detailed as ours, comes with a set of implications, which means that you are constrained in what you can do. And yes, there is a kind of system of amendment. But even for that system of amendment to be kind of scrupulously followed, you have to have an election and two elected houses of parliament. And so that conflict can't be avoided, but the conclusions that Nehru came to certainly could have been. And there were plenty of people who disagreed with it. And I think, in my opinion, they were right. I'm sure probably were others who felt differently. But once you normalize, and again, if I can just go to the Mukherjee's retort to Nehru really makes clear where he says, you know, you may be in power for this generation or for generations unborn, but supposing someone else comes into government, what is the precedent that you're laying down? And that's, I think, one of the most unfortunate consequences is that once you create a precedent and an avenue for something to be done, there's really nothing stopping someone else from utilizing the same mechanisms to the opposite effect. And that's kind of how, and Mukherjee has been proven true, I think."

        "message": "Yeah, no, I have three kind of observations here. One is I had done an episode with Gyan Prakash on the emergency and the point he made there, and you also quoted him in your book, is that, look, what Indira Gandhi did in 75 calling the emergency was not unconstitutional or extraordinary. It was delineated in the powers given to the state. Those extreme powers were given to the state. And you know, that's in the design of the state, which to a large extent remains. The second thought that strikes me is that in this position that Nehru is taking in constitutional morality versus democracy, and I agree with you that he took the wrong position. And in this position that he is taking, you could argue that in the long run, he is laying down the roots of a Hindu Rashtra, because if our society is such that the kind of dispensation that is in power today will one day get into the government, if you follow Nehru's argument to his logical end, then that means that these guys would be correct to change the constitution to reflect what they feel is a popular mandate that they have got. And many of the people from, you know, Nehru's party today would sort of perhaps not recognize that. But that's a logical end of Nehru's own kind of actions. And you know, one common question that I often ask my guests, so much so that it's almost become a cliche, and I'm sure you've heard it in past episodes is about this odd paradox of our constitution, which is, and let's go to the original 1950 constitution and imagine that the First Amendment isn't there yet, and which is of a relatively liberal constitution being imposed on an illiberal society. And you know, then how liberal can that imposition be, that a group of unelected elites, as it were, are sitting and saying that these are the values that we should live by. And this is something that, you know, I feel conflicted about, because those values, of course, I agree with. But at the same time, I can't square that circle and say that, why should I, you know, the core part of my value system is that I shall not impose my values on others. So you know, how does one square that circle?"

There is one very revealing quote, I'm not sure who said it in the Constituent Assembly, but someone said, you know, we were expecting the sounds of the veena and we got the sounds of an orchestra or something. It's something like that. Essentially, many people felt that the constitution wasn't rooted in a kind of, in the social milieu in which it was being born. And the one of, again, I kind of quote, I'm quoting Madhav Khosla here, because his most recent study of the constitution, the argument is that the constitution in itself is a kind of pedagogic document. So by practicing what the constitution is giving, you will be creating a kind of democratic citizen rather than there being a kind of popular upsurge, which results in the constitution. And it's an interesting, it's an interesting argument to make, because there is a sense that's what people thought. But equally it's, I mean, people are not very willing to be kind of educated in that way. And everyone kind of recognized that, and Ambedkar most prominently recognized that what was happening was that you were creating a kind of, you know, in his words, a democratic topsoil, topsoil based on the sort of subsoil of an undemocratic society. And it was an experiment. It was, you know, most constitutional scholars, you know, journalists, et cetera, everybody noted that it was a kind of brave and great experiment in democratic government. And that's one of the things that makes it so exceptional is the fact that it was a kind of leap of faith. But having committed themselves to it, the mistake that India's sort of early post-colonial elite made is the same that the British made when they first introduced provincial legislate, like popular legislatures in the provinces, is that once you introduce a kind of democratic system or a constitutional system, you have to be at some level willing to bear the consequences that accrue. And that was something that the Indian elite was unwilling to do. Now, we can make the case that there was, as Nehru tried to make, that there was a kind of grave threat to national security, to public order, and we can debate whether there was, but equally there are as many important figures who refuse to believe that such a thing existed, that there was such a grave threat. So I think squaring that kind of circle requires a certain broad-based commitment to the constitutional ideal that was, I think, not quite present even within the Congress party. And that's, I think, we're still kind of struggling to really square that circle because we've, in a way, uncorked a genie almost with the First Amendment. And obviously now it's been amended about 105 times, I think, possibly even more. And we're now at a point where without kind of going back to and redeveloping a sort of consensus on constitutional first principles, really, it's difficult to even contemplate squaring that circle because if you ask the two sides of the political divide, they have almost completely diametrically opposite readings of what the Constitution is and what it represents. And to square that is, I mean, it's quite a difficult proposition."

People often express shock and horror when they think of the BJP wanting to amend the Constitution. But, you know, as I mentioned earlier, there was an old cartoon about how it's not a book, but a periodical. And the economist Shruti Rajgopalan, who's a frequent guest on the show, had once given a talk on YouTube, which I'll link to where she talks about all the different amendments under Nehru to begin with. So, you know, some people have this impression that, hey, the amendments and the messing around started with Indira Gandhi and Nehru was a constitutionalist. And that's just a rubbish as, you know, your book and subsequent events also show. The other thing that I'm kind of struck by to sort of continue thinking aloud and be on a tangent is that what we often have, what disturbs me today, especially about politics is that politics has, and I imagine it was, you know, I would have thought it was less so in Nehru's time, but, you know, who knows. But what it has become is that it is tribal to the extent that people just care about which tribe they are part of and not about principles per se. So you know, you'll have people protesting about 153A and 295A when it's being used against one of their own, but they're quite happy to, you know, see it used against somebody else where, you know, how you judge a policy really comes down to which side you're on and which side is carrying the policy out. Like in these recent farm bills, for example, I was, you know, it's interesting how a lot of what has been enacted in these farm bills was part of the Congress manifesto in 2019 and they're protesting those very same things. And therefore it's become a politics of just tribalism of you pick your side and you go with it and not principles per se. And therefore it strikes me that no view that sort of really takes constitutionalism seriously is going to, you know, get any kind of traction because people don't care about principles even today. I mean, it's just about which side you're on and then you say whatever, but in practice you don't. I mean, this is a bit of an aside from me, I'm just thinking aloud, but what are sort of your thoughts on this and going back to that time, was there a sense of it then because the parties weren't so hardened and, you know, different things from each other at the time?"

And I think the way to really, and principles are, I feel like, quite a sort of top-down manner. The leaders have to demonstrate a commitment to constitutional morality if they expect it to kind of percolate downwards. And they just didn't, right from the word go. Again, in the context of the book you have, you know, at one point Nehru buried someone like K.V. Kamath, who, you know, intervenes at some point and he asked him not to quote things which are relevant at the time of the French Revolution and, you know, the American Revolution. So that was, I think, a pivotal moment in demonstrating that constitutional principles could be undone in pursuit of an obviously political agenda. In today's day and age, again, because it's something, I think, each precedent kind of builds on what comes before. Things get normalized very, very quickly. Things that we, you know, laws such as, you know, 153A and 295A, as you mentioned, which we now take for granted as existing in the books. We often don't remember that, you know, they were, as intended by the Constituent Assembly, these were not supposed to be allowed to continue. So it's, even back then, the situation was not drastically different. I mean, it was different to the extent that there was a sense of idealism and a particular dispensation was in power and remained in power for a very long time. But I don't think it was very different in terms of attitudes or in terms of commitment to constitutional principles, because if the constitution itself is malleable and changeable, it can't really, it obviously can't lead to a kind of enduring legal norms if those norms themselves are subject to frequent change. I think that's kind of what I would say to that, really."

And so just clarify this for me, that my impression about these laws, 124A, 153A, 295A was that any of the laws that are in the Indian penal code can be challenged if they are unconstitutional and struck down. And that is what would have happened in the case of these laws in the normal course of things. But the first amendment added those other sort of caveats to free speech.

It was very clear that the Constituent Assembly didn't want it and they didn't want it especially because of its association with repression in the British period, because most of the Congress stalwarts had been charged with sedition and jailed. And it's a point they make repeatedly during the debate that this was an act that was used against patriots and nationalists under British rule. And we can't be, I mean, we shouldn't, really shouldn't be bringing it back on the books. But it was, yes, you're absolutely right, they were unconstitutional. And they were brought back, they were brought back for a particular end. You might say that, well, the ends that Nehru thought were benevolent or somehow justified, but they were brought back. I mean, there was, it's perhaps hard to imagine now, but there was a period in time where these sections of the Indian Penal Code were unconstitutional. You could not be charged with sedition in the year 1950 because it was an unconstitutional part of the IPC. And I mean, I don't think Nehru alone is responsible, because obviously, there's been plenty of opportunities to repeal it or replace it with something else, and they haven't been taken.

Because I mean, Madras had been, the erstwhile Madras province, had been a kind of crucible for social justice politics with the creation of the Justice Party, the kind of appearance of Periyar, and the Justice Party had kind of enacted all of these sort of mechanisms, social justice mechanisms, amongst which was something called the communal general order, which allocated government employment and access to educational and government educational institutes in a particular ratio amongst communities. It was quite a peculiar instrument because what it did was it kind of allocated seats, for example, in a particular ratio. And so if the ratio was, I think it was something like every 14 seats, five could be Brahmins and three would be something else. So there would only be five Brahmins and it didn't matter if it was, I mean, it was almost a kind of ironclad quota, a kind of government-sanctioned distribution almost in a particular ratio rather than the way we understand reservations now. And so if only seven Brahmins were allowed, then the number of Brahmins could not be greater than seven, for example, or if the number of Harijans that were allowed was six out of 14, then they could not be six out of 14. It's not as if someone could get greater marks and go into another quota. So everyone was really subject to this system of quotas and that was challenged by a woman named Champakam Durairajan who had interestingly not even actually applied for admission but wanted to apply for admission and had been effectively told that her grades wouldn't allow her in through the Brahmin quota. And obviously there were other people with lower grades who would get in from their own community-based quotas. And so she kind of files a petition in the High Court in Madras. And the High Court in Madras, it arouses quite a lot of passion because it's a kind of great, it's a question that touches upon a lot of lives and you have a lot of protests, etc. The court holds a kind of interesting position. So what the court effectively does is the court finds the communal general order unconstitutional but what it also notes is that considerations of caste and community were not only not allowed, they were expressly taboo and that's the kind of language, it's quite stern, the language the court uses. And they keep saying basically that the right to equality and the right to freedom from discrimination will effectively become empty bubbles if the executive orders like the communal general order are allowed to be implemented or allowed to continue. So basically, again, an interesting aside, the petitioners were represented by the noted lawyer Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, who again had been one of the key architects of the constitution and also someone who advised the government on the amendment, which nullified a court order that he himself had won, which I still find the kind of intellectual somersaults that many of these people perform to be quite interesting. What the Madras government basically submits in court, it doesn't, it never really argued that the quotas didn't amount to discrimination. What it said was as a result of applying the ratio prescribed by the communal geo, 77 Brahmins, 224 non-Brahmins, 51 Christians, 26 Muslims and 26 Harijans had been selected for admission to engineering colleges. If caste and community considerations had been ignored, the numbers would have been 249 Brahmins, 112 non-Brahmins, 22 Christians, 3 Muslims and 0 Harijans. So to avoid this sort of system and to fulfil what they saw as a responsibility under the director principles of state policy, they had created this order. But again, the court, and if you don't mind, I'll just quote from the court order again, they say the communal geo denies equal treatment for all citizens under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and the disabilities imposed. It shuts out students having high qualifications solely on the grounds of their caste or religion and lets in others with inferior qualifications on the same ground. As the articles of the constitution stand at present, it is difficult to see how the state can make discrimination between applicant and applicant on the grounds of religion or caste and restrict the number of seats that could be secured by applicants of any particular religion or caste, or prescribe different qualifications to applicants of different religions or castes to the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others. Does social justice or the welfare of the state require a suppression of the integrity and freedom of the individual personality of the citizen by reason of his belonging to a particular caste? And so the court is quite strict and it, I mean, even when they end the judgment, and I quote again, if the person in charge for the time being of a state elected no doubt by a majority of voters at the polls were free to enforce their own notions of social and economic justice unfettered by constitutional restraints, there is a possibility of serious and undeserved hardship and injury to large classes of citizens. Suppression of a guaranteed right in article 15.1 of the constitution would be worthless if the government could disregard or nullify it by executive acts like the communal general order. And so the court is, I mean, effectively what it is saying is that any form of consideration of caste or community or religion into questions about employment or education is expressly taboo and what's, I mean, what's basically prevented by the sort of chapter on fundamental rights cannot then be enabled through the back door by the chapter on directive principles. And again, what the courts delineate is a kind of bastion of, not really a bastion, but a kind of bedrock of constitutional thought that fundamental rights effectively trump the directive principles of state policy. And this is something that the Nehru government doesn't completely agree with. And it's interesting to read Nehru's responses to this because the directive principles of state policy are kind of a hodgepodge of all sorts of things, including, you know, some concern education, some concern backward class welfare, but equally there are others which can concern animal husbandry and protection of cows. And if that, again, as something that we discussed earlier on, if, for example, someone was to take Nehru's position with respect to the article in the directive principles with regard to protection of cows, what could then, you know, what it could lead to something, sort of consequences that we would today be, you know, be right to question. So again, anyway, this, this judgment comes in, it really shocks the Madras government because the Madras government is, this has been an article of faith in Madras. Initially, of course, the Congress had opposed it when it was the Justice Party doing it, but this kind of social justice politics had acquired deep roots in Madras and the Congress government had continued with those policies. It was committed to reservations as an ideal. There was crucially, again, the question of an election coming up. The Madras Congress was right in its fears that there was a possibility that it would lose. And so they were quite, I mean, this is something that caused a lot of agitation within Madras. Interestingly, this is a question out of like the three sort of fault lines that you mentioned. This is the one that Nehru was the least invested in. So even though there was plenty of pressure from Madras to completely override Article 15, and also I think Article 29, which prohibited discrimination in the matter of admissions to educational institutions receiving state aid, this was something that Nehru cast, was something specifically that Nehru was kind of loathe to address, I would say. And so it's unlike the other two in which his mind is quite firmly made up, this third fault line takes a while to kind of build. There's pressure from Madras, the chief minister comes to Delhi to speak to him, ministerial delegations from Delhi come to speak to him. The initially Nehru's advice is for them to rewrite the communal general order to be in conformity with the constitution. But of course eventually he comes around and I think, and the literature on this is slightly hazy because it's something that is both in a way there is a kind of consensus that the state should be committed to the welfare of backward classes of citizens, and in a way there's no real clarity as to what it implies, because there had been no, unlike the question of the schedule cast, which had been tackled in the constitution, this was still a sort of work in progress. Nobody really knew what it was going to entail or who was going to kind of be classified as a backward class, what criteria would be used. So some of the opposition that came, of course, to the amendment did note that there was no clarity on this, there was no real way to tell what the consequences would be, and no way to really tell whether it would be misused by the state, although many suspected that it would be misused by the state. So this is, I think, the kind of strand in which Nehru was less the driving force and more the kind of, I think his role was more or less, he wasn't against it, but it was not something that he was strongly concerned with. So I think just the fact that the three things kind of came together sort of provided him with an opportunity to create the constitutional architecture for something that they might want to do in the future. And just as a sort of last point, this is something that's not very clear in their correspondence, but I would suspect that it was one of the sort of ways where how someone like Ambedkar was brought to agree with the whole sort of broad contours of the amendment, because we know that Ambedkar was not quite in agreement with the strand of it that targeted free speech, for example. And so I think it might also have been a way of sort of neutralizing dissent by bringing in several elements into one package, really."

        "message": "So let me try to, you know, parse and put in simple terms what this particular judgment would have meant and what the court's point of view would be, and you can tell me if I'm summarizing it correctly, is that the court basically referred to the fundamental right of equality and said that, look, the state has to treat everyone equally. That means the state cannot discriminate on the basis of caste and, hey, these reservations are in this discrimination on the basis of caste. Now you might justify it in this instance saying this is my lofty goal and the, you know, this is how this will let me get there. And that is an entirely separate argument. I mean, today, of course, reservations are conflated with caring about caste. So you, you know, it's deeply politically incorrect to make an argument that, you know, there are better ways to get rid of caste and reservations might actually be a top down thing that make them worse or can be misused, but leave that aside. Even if it is a tool that would work, the point that they're making is that once you give in to the temptation of infringing this fundamental right of equality for whatever reason, then what is to stop a popular government in the future from also infringing it for some reason of their own in some other way that they deem fit. And therefore, it is better that we hold it as sacrosanct and just stick to it."

        "message": "Would that be a correct summation? Yeah, I think that was more or less the court's reasoning. They were quite certain and they said quite clearly that if any government elected by a majority of the voters were allowed to have, you know, put their own considerations, express their own considerations through these sort of executive acts, then the entire, I mean, Article 15 of the Constitution would effectively become worthless. And the court, those are the court's words. So that's, yeah, that's a correct summation of the position. Interestingly, one of the sort of questions that comes up is how do you define social and educational backwardness? Are the two, you know, synonymous? And how much of a consideration is cast and how much of a consideration are the questions? And one of the key points of the amendment is that it leaves out any mention of economic circumstances. The only way, what it effectively did was the only way in which such backwardness could be judged was on the basis of cost. So economic considerations were expressly disallowed. And so that in itself has led to the kind of, it's, that debate in itself carries on now in questions or in issues about, like, for example, the idea of the creamy layer that comes up every time a question about reservations reaches the courts about how do you exclude people who are supposedly socially backward but economically well-to-do. And many of these debates go, again, go back to this kind of, this moment in time. And so, again, on the question of Article 15, when the amendment was discussed within the cabinet, there's a rare sort of consensus on what should be done. Because from Madras, the idea is that there should be alteration of Article 15, but also Article 29, which had prevented discrimination in the matter of admissions to educational institutes. And they basically wanted an amendment to the effect stating that nothing in either Article 15 or Article 29 too would prevent special provisions for the educational, economic and social advancement of the backward classes. And the cabinet, I think most were of the belief, or at least that's what was expressed, that there was, you know, this could not be misused for any class discrimination that was against the spirit of the Constitution. There was, I think, broad-based consensus that the spirit of the Constitution implied that measures were taken for social justice, measures were taken for kind of the advancement of backward classes. But again, if I, I'm just going to quote directly from my book, in a new twist, the cabinet also recommended that all references to economic and economically be dropped and the language be limited to socially and educationally backward classes. Through this slate of hand, the cabinet sought to achieve two objectives. First, it would remove any prospect of economic criteria coming in the way of calculating the backwardness of a class based on their social and educational standing. Second, it would preempt and negate any demands for special provisions or reservations for those who could be termed economically backward without the corresponding status of social or educational backwardness. So basically, they wanted power to legislate for reservations, but equally they wanted to prevent a kind of open-ended, almost race to, you know, race to the bottom. Because as, again, as K. V. Kamath, you know, quite pointedly intervenes in the debate and he says on the question of backwardness, well, 90% of the country is backward and there is no way of, you know, really differentiating who's educationally and socially backward through the use of the, you know, lens of caste and community. But of course, I mean, that was not a popular position. And so the exclusion of economic backwardness from the kind of ambit of India's reservation policy was, is again something that can be traced back to the First Amendment. And I think, again, the cabinet and many of the parliamentarians were not quite certain as to how the process or the policy of reservations was going to be developed, because it was something that had yet to really be, you know, finalized. I think the first Backward Class Commission was appointed much after this. So I think today, many of the questions that we would consider today, questions about like recent before the 29 elections, of course, the government announced a kind of reservation policy for economically weaker sections. And of course, the question of the creamy layer within the backward classes keeps cropping up. And again, that's a question that goes back to the First Amendment. And I think that's, it's one of the most interesting sort of fault line of the three. It's probably possibly the most interesting, because at the time, it also seems to be the least important. The least amount of attention is paid to it."

So I'll quickly quote this book where you write at the time of the, you know, just before the First Amendment is happening, you write quote, the Prime Minister was essentially making three claims. First at the failure of the Congress social agenda when confronted with the constitution should be regarded as an intolerable situation. Since he did not want to face the populace and be accused of breaching his promise, the constitution would have to give way to the primacy of the Congress program. Second that the social policy is devised by elected legislatures, sites of popular sovereignty, being held unconstitutional by the courts was a denial of democracy, even if the legislatures had been elected on a distinctly limited and narrow franchise. In true democratic spirit, the constitution would have to bend to accommodate the will of the people as represented by a legislature elected indirectly, and on a limited franchise. Third, the three pillars of the state, the judiciary, the executive and the legislature were not equal. The executive was to create and give effect to social policy. And it was to have primacy over the other wings of the state, especially the judiciary. It was a slippery slope, stop quote. And separately in an interview, you've spoken about how the first amendment showed the judiciary"

        "message": "But yeah, interesting that you you mentioned what the media would be showing, because if you were to simply go by Nehru's utterances, the media didn't seem to be all that different back in the day, even though we we know it was, but Nehru consistently rails against the media. And one of the things he keeps saying, you know, is what will be the effect on our soldiers and what will be the effect on our youth of reading this trash? So I think he might have probably written the same thing, same thing about Republic. But to go back to your question, Nehru makes this claim, the sort of three claims that you mentioned, and he makes them quite, quite strongly. So there is there is a letter where he basically says that the job of the government is no longer simply to, you know, to make policy, it is now to basically direct social change and to see it through. And he's firmly committed to that line. Politically, things kind of progressively reach, at least what he thinks, as a kind of difficult time because he's, Zamindari abolition is something that he's very committed to. Post Patel's death, there is no real challenger within the Congress establishment. And as the sort of new year kind of opens, there's this feeling that there has to be a sort of reckoning with these questions. So what happens is, and again, this is to Nehru's credit, is that Nehru initially aims to hold elections in the summer of 1951. He's kind of stopped because of obstructionism by the states. Many of the states, mainly for these reasons, are kind of not quite ready to test their popularity. And you can kind of see why, because, for example, in Madras, the Congress fails to win a majority in the first election. So there's a kind of obstructionism that happens in the states. Nehru presses his chief ministers quite hard without success. And so elections are eventually delayed. And of course, that kind of gives them enough time to basically address these issues before going in for election. So basically, if I could, on the morning of 25 January 1951, the Congress Working Committee meets at Congress headquarters. And again, the question, as reported by the press, is they discuss the question of how to galvanize the Indian National Congress so as to maintain its moral and political hold over the people. Over the final quarter of, over the sort of tail end of 1950, Sardar Patel had died. There had been the formation of a kind of dissident unit within the Congress called the Democratic Front, led by Kriplani and Rafi Ahmad Gidwai. There was kind of speculation that several senior figures could quit. The Nehru government itself had been, had, you know, three major ministerial resignations over 1950, Mathai, Mukherjee, Niyogi. And it's sort of surreal to look back now and read the kind of press reports, because there are several editorials which keep questioning, being like, will the Congress survive in its present form? You know, what will be the future? And so I think even if it seems surreal to us now to look back and think, well, you know, why would people doubt the ability of the Congress to survive in 1951, there were several who did. And so I think this kind of backdrop is important to remember, and I think that kind of gives impetus to this kind of feeling that all these questions now have to be tackled head on before they go back to the people. And of course, the Allahabad High Court then stops the UP. It grants injunctions against the UP Zamindari Abolition Act, which it takes up for examination. And that kind of builds this idea that there's almost, the government is sort of under a form of judicial siege, because these are, I mean, these are quite big sort of cornerstones of government policy. So as things build up over the first few months of 1951, you have, in January, you have the Allahabad High Court judgment, which effectively stays the operation of the UP Act. You then have, in March, the judgment of the Patna High Court, which declares the Bihar Act to be unconstitutional. And then you also have sort of, in between, you have all of these things kind of brewing in the background. You have once, you know, Master Tara Singh has been released, as I pointed out in the previous part of the conversation, he kind of declares his intention to bring on board, invites the communists and the Hindu Mahasabha to join him on a common platform. There is this sort of democratic front, which is, you know, bubbling within the Congress. So there are all of these, I wouldn't really class it as political turmoil, but there's all this, there's a lot of politics going on, going on in the background. And I think it kind of leads to a situation where progressively the government, there have been adverse judgments in, you know, on huge matters of policy, on reservations, on Zamindari abolition. And progressively, the impression that one gets from reading Nehru's correspondence is a kind of feeling of siege, almost. And there is within the Congress broad backing for a kind of collision with the constitution and the judiciary. And when matters finally reach a head, there is, and you notice that there is more or less almost, I wouldn't say universal consensus, but there's more or less like enough support within the Congress party for the amendment to be contemplated. When it's done, they start drafting it as early as March, even though Nehru publicly keeps denying that an amendment is coming or, you know, assures, for example, he attends a meeting of the All India Newspaper Editors Conference, where he assures them that the freedom of the press is something that is very dear to him. And they take it to mean that he has dropped the idea of a constitutional amendment. And, you know, they thank him voluminously for his generosity. So there's a lot that's going on. And politically, the kind of sense that I get is of a government consistently being forced onto the back foot and on matters that it considered very close to, if there was anything that was a kind of matter of faith within the Congress, those two things definitely were it."

        "message": "It's very interesting because Prasad and Nehru dynamic went through its ups and downs. Prasad, for starters, considered himself Nehru's equal. Secondly, his own conception of the president's role was not simply, I mean, he took the idea that he was to advise and guide quite seriously. So he wasn't a rubber stamp sort of president. And equally, Prasad was very willing to intervene in government and let his views be known. But crucially, he was well aware of the sort of need to maintain constitutional rectitude or, you know, set good precedents. And so, for example, when Nehru writes to him and tells him it would be exceedingly unfortunate if your views were to become publicly known, Prasad actually doesn't let his views be publicly known. I mean, he's willing to write to the prime minister, but he's not willing to kind of jeopardize the whole setup by stepping outside constitutional bounds, which, to be honest, he could have done if he really wanted to, but he doesn't. And the same thing kind of happens when the Zamindari Abolition Act is passed. The president has to certify the Zamindari Abolition Act because it obviously contravenes a part of the constitution, and it can be saved, or at least it's assumed to be saved by a presidential notification or presidential approval. And when he gets the Bihar law, Rajendra Prasad obviously recognizes the flaws in it. And he kind of tarries by asking for legal opinion, and he sits on it. And you know, Nehru writes to him again, when I quote, and he says, and effectively tells him that the cabinet have agreed to it, and threatens to resign if the president doesn't certify the act. And of course, Prasad then promptly does certify it, even though he doesn't really quite agree with Nehru or recognize what the need for this sort of daring hurry is. So it's interesting to note that Prasad takes his role seriously, but is also effectively very committed to the constitutional order. At no point does he seek to kind of overturn it or to even intervene in a way that could be seen to be deliberately intervening in areas of government that he really should not be intervening in. So that is a very, very interesting dynamic. Especially when Nehru often thinks that Rajendra Prasad has a propensity to exceed his brief, because his reading of the situation is that the president is duty bound to follow the advice of his council of ministers. And things kind of come to a head when the amendment reaches Rajendra Prasad, because he obviously doesn't sign it immediately. He seeks legal opinion, because he thinks the amendment itself might well be unconstitutional, because the method used to pass it, coincidentally, eerily similar to what was used recently in the case of Article 370. So Prasad suspects that the amendment itself may be unconstitutional, and he asks for advice from Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, whose advice we don't have on record. But obviously, Prasad signs it in the end. So I think the legal advice he received probably indicated that that's what he should do. So it's, it's a very interesting dynamic, but Prasad doesn't shy away from letting his views be known. And in most cases, those views are quite the opposite of what the government has."

But you know, you read him in the constitutional debates with Nehru and so on. And this seems like, you know, one of the tallest, most principled leaders."

        "message": "So what's your sense of all of that? He was he was actually a remarkably principled man. And he that's borne out by, for example, his resignation from the Nehru cabinet. It's also borne out, quite importantly, by his resignation from the Hindu Mahasabha, because what people don't realize is that he quit the Hindu Mahasabha, because he felt that once we have a secular state, there was no need or no space for a quote unquote, Hindu party anymore. So he's that way, he's a very, very interesting and complex figure to look at. But and one of the things that comes across in these debates with Nehru is that unlike Nehru, whose debates are very impassioned, but also often short on facts and logic, Mukherjee is a very incisive speaker. And it's again, this is borne out when they speak, because most of the time when the debate happens, obviously Nehru presents his case, and then Mukherjee replies as the leader of the opposition. So the first time the bill is kind of debated in Parliament, Mukherjee replies and immediately after Mukherjee replies, the person to speak is NG Ranga, Congress stalwart, later one of the founders of the Swatantra Party, and he compares Mukherjee to Edmund Burke, and calls it one of the greatest speeches that he's ever heard in Indian Parliament. So it's interesting to note, the kind of impression that you get of Mukherjee is very unlike what is often believed, because you hear of him in the context of Kashmir, in the context of 370, but you often don't hear of him in the context of freedom of speech, for example. And Mukherjee is one of the most dogged defenders of that freedom, and in many ways very, very patient, because he keeps, one of the reasons that he criticises Nehru again, is because he's well aware that what Nehru is doing is laying a precedent for something far worse in the future, or in some ways providing legal and constitutional tools that are prone to misuse by anyone who is willing to transcend his scruples, or his commitment to constitutionalism. And Mukherjee almost leads the kind of charge against the bill, and I think he makes a very, very successful case for himself, and for the opposition. It's reported widely in the press, it's, again, commentators often note that, you know, whatever of the, I think the line that I remember offhand is the Times of India describing the debate between Nehru and Mukherjee and noting that the Prime Minister's passion was more than outmatched by the incisive logic of Mukherjee's arguments, and I think that it's, that's quite apparent that he sort of read between the lines of what was happening far more clearly than many of the others did, and he was willing to stake out a principled position, despite the fact that it had, you know, caused him to leave the Nehru cabinet, almost kind of enter the political wilderness, and in many ways, take out a position that many of his own ideological fellow travelers are perhaps not the most comfortable with."

        "message": "Yeah, and it would seem that, you know, Mukherjee was, of course, borne out by history, not the history of the last few decades, but just the history of the next few years, in the sense that it wasn't just about those specific amendments or those specific policies, which Nehru wanted to get through, but about the desecration of the constitution and of constitutionalism itself, you know, which had led Justice, Chief Justice Hidayatullah to once quip that ours was the only constitution which needed protection against itself. And the father of our constitution, B. R. Ambedkar, in fact, in 1954, I think after the Fourth Amendment, when he was no longer in government, said, quote, we built a temple for a god to come in and recite, but before the god could be installed, if the devil has taken possession of it, what else could we do except destroy the temple? We did not intend that it should be occupied by the Asuras, we intended it to be occupied by the Devas. That is the reason I said, I would rather like to burn it, stop quote, which are strong words from someone who actually, you know, was a driving force behind our constitution. Let's so you know, eventually it gets passed and it's a done deal. You've, you know, sort of, I want to ask you about the aftermath, but before that, I'll quickly quote you from your book where you've written this very eloquent passage, quote, the relationship between the state and the citizen was altered for all time. The precedent was set for easy, almost casual amending of the constitution and the passing of retrospective legislation, a mechanism for bypassing judicial review was created. Sedition had been retrospectively validated, a host of public safety and press control laws had been made operational again. Free speech was curtailed, no longer would it be necessary for the security of the state to be seriously undermined for it to prescribe free expression. It merely had to be in his interest to do so. The subservience of the constitution to government policy was demonstrated. The constitutional groundwork was laid for a host of repressive legislation to follow. A vital cardinal change had occurred, which would have immense long-term consequences for India, its people, and its politics, stop quote. And the thing is, you know, despite people paying so much lip service, I mean, people pay so much lip service to the constitution, even, you know, prime minister Modi once said that it's his holy book and, and you know, for all practical purposes, the constitution is like what Mukherjee said, Nehru was turning it into a scrap of paper where any government, if it has the numbers can just change it and it's nowhere near as liberal as many people seem to think it is. And this is becoming, you know, more and more explicit by the day if it wasn't already before. What do you think are sort of the consequences for this? Does the constitution no longer matter or, you know, different question entirely perhaps, do those principles no longer matter? Was the experiment doomed to failure from the start?"

I think it was, it was quite a brave leap of faith and everyone involved acknowledged it as, as a leap of faith. But I think, again, I'll quote you. It's a quote that I took from Sunil Killani again, where he says, basically, in a setting such as India, individuality as a way of social being was a precarious undertaking. And then he describes Indian liberalism to be crippled from its origins, stamped by utilitarianism and squeezed into a culture that had little room for the individual. So we, I mean, everyone knew that it was a kind of challenging project to begin with. It was never going to be easy, it was never going to be, how should I put it, clean in a way. It was always going to be a messy process. But I wouldn't say it was kind of doomed to failure. If anything, the kind of first, the story of the First Amendment proves that actually there were many who were willing to, you know, take it at face value to judiciary certainly was. They were willing to uphold constitutional freedoms and kind of read them quite expansively. There was certainly quite important figures within the political setup who seemed to be at least to be votaries of constitutional freedoms. There was a press that was quite vigorous in its sort of position and defense of the right to free speech. Governments such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, who I mean today we would term as probably completely obsequious, was, for example, willing to stand up and, you know, and be counted in a matter of, you know, such political importance. So I don't think I would say it was doomed to failure. I mean, if anything, that kind of year proved that there was, that it could actually have been quite a successful experiment if it hadn't really been betrayed in its sort of essentials by the people who kind of midwife the experiment to begin with. I mean, we can't deny that these are the people who also wrote up the Constitution. So it was, I mean, it was their experiment and they failed it more than anything else."

        "message": "And do you think sort of institutions also shape society in a deeper way? For example, you know, there's this common lament that, oh, look, you know, at the time of our independence, at the time of our freedom struggle, we had such tall leaders and we have such not tall leaders now, so to say, and I've written a column again using incentives to sort of talk about this while pointing out that all the freedom fighters who came to the fore and who were tall leaders at the time of our independence had entered the freedom struggle and become leaders, not because they had power at the end of it or money at the end of it. They did it just to stand up for principles. There was no reward. So politics attracted that kind of a person. But when you have, later on, when you have a sort of a structure where there's a state is an overarching my barb and has so much power and essentially the similar oppressive role to what the colonial state had, then it will draw the kind of leaders who are attracted to power for power's sake and power to whatever. And therefore those tall principle leaders will no longer emerge. And it would seem to me that the degrading of the constitution in a sense would also have been a further disincentive for people of principle to actually enter the fray."

        "message": "Do you think there's something to that? I mean, I think it's yes, yes and no. So yes, sort of institutions and, you know, precedence and the law itself and the constitution itself do shape society in certain ways. I mean, it's hard to deny or even overstate the kind of normative power that they wield. Even today, for example, protesters who hold copies of the constitution aloft, kind of what they try to do is they're trying to channel the normative power of the constitution rather than, you know, actually looking at the nitty gritties of what the constitution says. I'm quite shocked if they were to actually see what the constitution says. But it's one of the reasons that the constitution was written in the way that it was, was that a lot of figures, Ambedkar especially, had little faith in the ability of Indian society to reform itself or for there to be a sense of corrective impulse originating from within society. And because they didn't have that faith in the self-correcting ability of society almost or the possibility of any idea of social reform really originating from within society or taking hold organically within society, they almost had an over-dependence on using legal forms to drive what they saw as social or political change. And ultimately, I mean, recently Pratap Bhanu Mehta, for example, wrote a column where he very generously quoted from my book, but again, the sort of crux of the column was that there's only so much that can be accomplished by the use of legal and constitutional tools, I mean, if fundamentally social questions can only partially be addressed in terms of legality. And I think that's one point where figures like Nehru and Ambedkar were perhaps over-enthusiastic about how much the law could achieve. And secondly, I think they were perhaps quite cavalier in thinking about the effects that would be generated by these sort of institutional mechanisms, because Nehru, for example, seemed almost unaware, I mean, and it's hard to judge whether he was deliberately ignorant or genuinely unaware of the kind of incentives that would be generated or the kind of consequences that would be generated through the First Amendment. It's hard to tell. You could, I mean, at best he was naive, at worst he was, you know, malevolent. And so I think both these strands kind of intersected at this point."

Because you know, as we discussed at the start of the show, we are in times where history has been weaponized, where Nehru is looked upon as on one side as exclusively the ideal liberal who could do no wrong and on the other side as this demon who is responsible for everything that has gone wrong with India. And obviously, like any person, and as your book acknowledges, you know, all figures in history contain multitude. So all of it is true, and all of it is false and all of that. But I would imagine that nevertheless, in your book, it would seem as if it's ideal fodder for those who want to blame Nehru for where India is today. So is that something you were wary of? And has that impacted the way your book has been read, where people are not actually reading the book for the nuance and the history, but they are just sort of weaponizing it?"

It's to be as kind of as incisive as possible and shine the spotlight as bright as you can. And that's something that I've tried to do. I think, I'm sure there are people who've read it, because it can provide sort of intellectual fodder for an attack on Nehru and Nehruvinism. And I'm sure there are some people who've read it or have perhaps used it like that. But most reviews have generally been quite complimentary. We've most of, yeah, the book doesn't set out to target Nehru. It's just that the things unfold in the way they do. And the episode is not particularly complimentary to Nehru. But equally, I think it's very revealing in the way that it kind of looks at Nehru as well, because Nehru had many aspects to his personality. And the fact that he was impatient, kind of authoritarian, imperious in many ways. I mean, those aspects of his personality are as important as anything else, as his sort of commitment, often kind of pedantic and tendentious, as it were, his commitment to democracy, to the idea of collective decision making, etc. And so to have a more complete or rounded picture, you need both sides. And I think in that way, this story is very, very revealing. But some perhaps might have used the book in that way. But I think most people have taken it in the right spirit. I haven't really seen, all of the reviews have been quite sort of complimentary and not quite, nobody has really kind of seen the book as a sort of weapon against Nehru. I mean, it is what it is. Just one more point, if I make it, is that I'm sure there are plenty of people who would have disliked it or not read it or not engaged with it, equally, because they see Nehru as this kind of, you know, grand liberal figure who I've kind of set out to defame. And so neither of those things are true. I mean, history is neither kind nor generous, it just is."
