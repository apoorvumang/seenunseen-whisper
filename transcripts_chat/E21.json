But his mind was burning as the earth was turning and the world was churning and in the center of it stood this boy in a slum. A social activist came to the slum and said to the boy, you're looking glum. Why do you look so sad? Oh, this slum must be so bad. It really makes me mad. I wish I could send you back to where you're from. This amused the boy from the slum. He said, I gotta say you're pretty dumb. The reason I came here was I prefer it to there. That life I could not bear. And this I do declare that I will beat only to my own drum. Once a posh kid met the boy from the slum. He said, you slum dwellers, you're all scum. With a smile and not a frown, a boy looked him up and down and said, good afternoon. You're trapped in your cocoon. Now this may astound you, confuse you and confound you. But look, there's an invisible city all around you. Your independence is just for show. You need me more than you know. Right now, I'm just a boy in a slum. But you don't know what I could become."

Now slums in India are both demonized and deified. On the one hand, people look down on them as centers of filth and squalor and eyesore to the city. On the other hand, they're praised as hotbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship. Beyond these two simplistic notions, both of which are true, lies a much more fundamental role that a slum plays in a city. To shed light on this, I have with me on the show Pawan Srinath, a policy analyst at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore and a frequent guest on the show. Welcome to the show, Pawan.

They're aberrations and anomalies, right? At best, people look at them as these hubs of poverty and inequality. And, you know, if pushed to say what are good things about a slum, someone might say, you know, at least they're a source of cheap labor. They're the reason why labor costs are kept down in the city.

You can have 10,000 rupees in your pocket. You are now able to come into an Indian city and somehow struggle and, you know, start off. The struggle is still immense. But remember that we are still India. India has slums because we have freedom of movement in this country. And that's a powerful force. You look at some place like China where you have a resident system called hukou. So you have half or a third of urban residents who are illegal. You don't even have basic rights. In India, we don't have that. Obviously, access to basic services and so on is still very limited. But you have the freedom to go where you want. So you have the freedom to make a personal sacrifice, be crazy enough to give up a life back home and move to a city, struggle, you know, take a hit on health, on dignity and so on. Why? So that, you know, you can give your next generation a slightly better chance at prosperity."

You have far more movement of people from villages to slums and cities rather than from slums to villages, which, you know, if you look at the Gandhian view of the idyllic village life, that's sort of what you'd expect. So what you're really saying is that slums, therefore, have that social good that they allow this mobility. Anyone can come into a city at any point in time. And you have a place where you can go and stay and where you can then, that's a base for your struggles. How does this impact the policy thinking behind slums? Like over time, because of these different views that we have of slums, you will often have the elite sort of proposing that we need to do away with slums, that look at the extremes of wealth that you see, that someone's flying into Bombay airport and the first thing you see is the slums and we need to do something about that. And their other argument is that slums form a vote bank from politicians who benefit from keeping poor people in slums, making sure they stay poor in slums."

So absolutely, but while that is there, the old idea in India was get your slums cleared out of the city. So you had slum clearance boards and the idea was you get rid of the area, get rid of the people, maybe provide housing in some corner of the city outside where real estate costs are low, completely uprooting people from the local economic livelihoods that they were in, the economy that they were a part of.

So in the act of giving them better housing and better amenities, if you're killing the jobs, then you're not helping anyone. Because people are more politically empowered, even in slums today, that they've been able to resist such moves. Having said that, so now the idea is, let's do redevelopment within the site. And this is better than the alternative. But even this has a lot of problems. You're still thinking about slums from a, you know, land, property rights, titling type of a regime, rather than this point of how do you allow people to come into a city at every single price point. So the idea is access and an entry point rather than, OK, here are people who are already sort of living here informally.

And the place is, you know, good enough for you to live a week and sort of manage, but bad enough that you want to leave as soon as you have the ability to, right? So if you look at olden days in India, more powerful communities and caste groupings and others had, you know, their own chow trees and what in Kannada we call chatras in various cities, where the idea is that if you're a young boy of that community who goes into that city, you have a natural place to land up before you find a college or a place of work or something. So now this was self-provided by communities. And obviously this was far from perfect, right? But that is the spirit of\u2026 So if you're a young job seeker from, I don't know, from rural Maharashtra, from Marathwada, you're coming to Dharavi to find a job. Is there a place where you can do so? Is there a permanent place where you can maybe live for a week? You can get access to what kind of jobs that exist. And then you sort of move in and integrate with Mumbai's economy, right? So you don't have enough such state provisioned entry access points. And if the state in India really wants to care about the right to equity, right? What you're really talking about is access, right? So the state does have a role to play in this.

So you've come from a village, you will drive the way you might have driven in a village. But Bangalore, you have to follow different rules now, right? You go to New York, this is the standard example that every Indian cribs about. Oh, you go to a foreign city, you stop littering. And oh, we Indians are hypocrites, when we go abroad, we don't litter. No, we Indians are human beings, right? So we go to those cities and we conform to the behavior expected in those cities. Indian cities are terrible at imposing this on people. No one in New York comes up to you and bullies you into not littering, right? You just don't do it because that's the norm. I think if Indian cities can establish these norms better, and this is again a society in action, you know, in concert with the government, and you allow for better access at every price point, I think our cities will be far healthier."

And in the middle of the night, he screamed at me because I jumped a signal. And there was absolutely no one there. And it's like my muscle memory told me just keep going ahead. But anyway, leaving that aside, so I just want to try summing up the seen and unseen effects of the different kinds of interventions with slums. So just correct me or elaborate if required. Intervention number one is you remove the slum from the city and you take it outside. And the seen effect is that there is no longer that eyesore of the slum in the city. But the unseen effect would be that all the people who came there, came there for as cheap labor. For example, they were maidservants or watchmen or whatever. And now those jobs have supply problem because these people have been moved out of the city. And there is therefore a mismatch which the market had otherwise corrected for. The slum was essentially the response of the market. It grew organically because it was filling that demand. So that's the unseen effect that you're killing this. And the other intervention is that you do in-situ development where again, the seen effect is the same. That look, it's not an ugly slum. It's a proper building, it's respectable, better quality of life for the people who stay there. But the unseen effect is that it affects the fact that slums earlier are typically, if you have a hundred bucks in your pocket or whatever, you come and you manage and you do jugaar."

So maybe the answer there is now open up a new slum. So even here, I just want to add that one of the developments that has happened is smaller such settlements, instead of having a big apartment complex, take a small plot of land, build five stories over there. So you house, I don't know, 50 people, but you do many more of these. The idea being that jobs, especially low end service jobs in Indian cities, are very, very location dependent. You need to be close by and you also need to be able to search for other such gigs nearby. Now, with the coming of, you know, app based businesses and so on, the distance and the proximity is weakening, but still not at the scale that India really needs. So those things are still important. But what I'd say is they're still not addressing the fundamental problem. How do you have more points in the city where people can come in at every single price point?"

Now, the reason that this is a false dichotomy is that the government always knows when and where development is happening. Be it building registrations, be it electricity connections, water supply connections, you know, business licenses. So government always has a handle that, hey, you know, here's where real estate is heating up. Here is where more businesses are opening up and so on. And that has been properly gamed by those who can play that game. So the standard refrain in Bangalore is, oh, we had no idea Bangalore would grow so rapidly. No, you had a clue month on month, day on day where what was happening, right?

I mean, the values appreciate and then someone seeks rent off of it. So that enough rent has been sought, right? So people know, except it's a standard sort of hand-wringing excuse that government officials like to give. So I think what planning should be is responsive. Paul Romer, the economist, had this idea that the single biggest element of planning in a city for a government is acquisition of land. Supposing you know that the city is going to expand in a particular direction, go leap ahead of time and buy a piece of land somewhere. That can be a bus station tomorrow. That can be a railway station tomorrow, a metro hub, something, right? Good cities have worked where public sector agencies and city governments have created land banks for themselves, which they've acquired intelligently. They've compensated people well and then deployed these assets well much later. Because if you haven't bought a plan ahead of time and private parties have bought all of it, that's your single biggest problem in defining a city. The fundamental problem with a city is that any of the choices that you and I make with how our housing is done, how our layouts are done, we have locked ourselves in for 70 to 150 years. So in terms of liberty, that's your trade-off, right? The action that you take impinges on the liberty of people to five generations below you."
