I've known Rajesh since early 2015, and he's most famously known for being one of the brains behind Narendra Modi's rise to power. But I saw a completely different side of Rajesh when I met him. He had gotten buyer's remorse in 2014 itself, and when I met him in 2015, was an articulate and vociferous critic of Modi, a man he had once supported for understandable reasons. But Rajesh had the intellectual honesty to change his mind about Modi, and the commitment to continue working on projects that were actually designed to get Modi out of power at considerable personal risk to himself. He hasn't spoken about this publicly much in the past, but we'll speak about some of that on this episode, and we won't speak about certain parts of it. And while this episode is supposed to be about Dhanwapsi, which is an insanely ambitious and extremely interesting project he's on, I decided to dedicate only the second half of the episode to that project, and spend the first half discussing why he supported Modi to begin with, and what made him change his mind. This is a really long episode, but it's fascinating, so do listen to the full thing, after a quick commercial break.

Rajesh, I've known you for like the last three or four years, I've of course known of you from way before that you are one of India's first tech millionaires, and I've kind of been seeing what you've been doing in the blogging space for, you know, from a decade before that, but I actually met you two or three years ago. And I find the story of your political consciousness, so to say that how you from just being someone who'd made a lot of money in tech, to how you got interested in politics in a deeply passionate way, extremely interesting, because most middle class or rich Indians tend to be apathetic about politics. How did that happen? What changed?"

When your son, Abhishek, who was three years old at that time, when he grows up and tells you or asks you, Papa, you saw all that was going wrong in the country. You had the time, you had the money, why didn't you do something about it? What will you answer him? And that was the question which really set me thinking. And as happens many times, when you start thinking about it, sort of doors open up. And this was late 2008. And then early 2009, I'd met with Piyush Goyal, because he had come to assess my company Netcore for BJP's SMS campaign. And we got talking. And then I said, look, there are a lot of people like me who would like to help in the elections. We've been sort of longtime BJP supporters, and elections are coming up in four or five months. And we'd like to do something about it. And from there started Friends of BJP. So it was not sort of structured, just one event led to another. But the question really made me think about what we need to do to help transform India."

And also in the 2000s, when I started sort of thinking for myself, on the political space, I think one thing which came and was that the policies of the Congress, once you start reading, you start thinking about it, why has India been poor? And the party which had been in power for a very long time, of course, has been the Congress. And again, if you look back at that period, after 2004, onwards, also, there wasn't anything substantially different being done from what they had done previously. So the support for Congress really wasn't there. I had written a blog post, in fact, in early 2009, when I started Friends of BJP said, I described BJP as the lighter shade of grey, I said, you can't really, it's not a black and white thing. But at that time, the memory, of course, of the BJP was the Vajpayee government and the sort of some of the reforms that they had brought into play. So a, there was a family history of having supported the BJP, b, there was some sort of an antithesis towards the Congress based on my own sort of reading and conversations with different people. And third, there was the opportunity which came up through the BJP SMS campaign, which was, of course, a professional activity that we had done."

So, you know, just to sort of, again, go back, I mean, obviously, we are, I know, on the same page as regards to the harm that the Congress has done the country. I mean, we've been poor for decades longer than we should have because of bad policies in the case of Nehru that you can say they were misguided because those were the fashion of the time. There were white statesmen who built institutions and did a lot else, which was great and but just got the economics all wrong. And in the case of Indira Gandhi, I mean, I think we'd both agree that many of her economic policies were crimes on humanity, even if you leave emergency aside, she was an absolute monster for the damage that she caused to the poor of this country, despite her slogans like Gareebi Hatao and all that. So I completely get that, that at some point in time, you begin to feel that, damn it, we need an alternative. And we can't have any more of this, our people need freedom in every way, economic freedom and every other freedom. But I think where our intellectual parts differ is that I never went from there to support from the BJP. BJP seemed to me to be equally bad in other ways. So I agree with you that Vajpayee's prime ministership did give a lot of hope and he had some good people like Arun Shourie in his cabinet. But you know, at the time that you decided to kind of support the BJP and go all in and you describe them as a lighter shade of grey, inevitably, that would mean propping up Modi supporting Modi. And you know, and Modi had the history of 2002 behind that."

The idea was, how do you get middle class more engaged in conversations in the political space? I remember writing about what I called at that time, the secession of the successful that people, like you said, right in the beginning, people become apathetic in the political space and they don't tend to vote, or even want to have conversations about those things. So the idea was, how do you get a more structured form of conversation going? First, BJP lost the elections and then Friends of BJP also sort of petered out, they didn't want anything to do with it afterwards. In political parties, there's no sort of introspection on why you lost. You can't really point fingers at a single person and you can't, so it's collective responsibility, which means no one's really responsible."

And you compare it with what was happening in the country. So there's a context also, what's happening in the country, 2010, 2011, some of the scams had started coming out also, the leadership really of the country was not very strong. And Gujarat's track record, at least the visible track record at that time was quite good. I mean, one thing which we would see, which you could see the difference is the roads really. You travel from, say, Bombay to Rajasthan, which we used to do often by road. And you know, when you're leaving Gujarat and you're coming into Rajasthan, the roads were significantly different. So the idea was that in the BJP, if you're supporting the BJP and you are a choice between two parties, really, so if you want to do something in the political space at that time, it was this or the other, there was no alternative to any of these two.

In fact, I traveled with him to China in 2011. And I wrote a fairly detailed blog post about it. And the one memory which stood out for me was on the flight back. And there were about 20 people on the flight, mainly business people from Gujarat. He called everyone to the front of the aircraft and asked everyone, tell me what went right for you in the trip? What could we have done better as a team? And any other candid suggestions and for the next four hours, he was listening to as every person spoke. Now, I interacted with politicians in 2009, some of the BJP politicians, and I found this ability to listen, as just not there in most of the other politicians. So you combine multiple things together. And even in my one to one conversations with him, here's a person who is very open, very listening, which typically doesn't happen, like I said, with the political class.

There was a book which had come out in late 2012, Victory Lab, which actually said how political science was used through the years in the US.

And the strategy for trying to win 180 versus the strategy for 280 is very different. 180, really, it's a summation of state elections. But if you want to get a majority on your own, you need to make it a wave election. So there has to be one dominant theme pretty much across the country. And I said, that is really what I want to work on, but I didn't want to take any orders from anyone else. I was very clear. As an entrepreneur, I'm doing it from the outside. So that then led me to the formation of Neeti. And we worked in four areas. So those were the sort of learnings I picked up from my experience in 2009. And then only keeping on looking at the political space, where are the gaps? So I said, we need four things. We need a media platform, because there was nothing which was really pro-BJP or able to articulate the BJP viewpoint or even be pro-Modi. So that was Neeti Central, which we set up. The second one was India Votes, which had all the electoral data. Again, it was very hard to get elections data. The Election Commission had it, but it was in Excel files and PDFs. So we took all of that and made it into a very nice, browsable, public, open site. Then there was the analytics. So where do you focus on? So there are 10 lakh booths in the country, 543 constancies. Which are the constancies where you have a greater chance of winning? In the constancies, which booths should you focus on? There's a lot of historical data available through Form 20 data, which is the booth level data, which is made public again on the Election Commission site, but no one would look at it. And the fourth one was the volunteering platform. So what we called India272.com at that time, that people could, wherever they are in the country, help in spreading information about Modi or about the BJP and what it wants to do to people in their neighborhood. So without becoming part of the formal party structure, you could just work on that. So I took learnings from what I had seen in 2009, what I thought were missing, plus some from my readings, and then like an entrepreneur, you know, you identify which are the gaps, and then you see how you can plug those or fill those."

And it was available through a website where they could pick up this information, pick up the electoral rolls, we are on a campaign where if you supported Modi, you could SMS your voter ID. And then we digitize the electoral rolls, so we could then map voter IDs to the person and the constituency. So the idea is, see, in the election, it's actually a very simple idea. It's basically being able to identify who supports you, and who does not, and who are the ones in the middle. So it's a support score that you need, combined with a turnout score. So if you are likely to support and you're likely to turn out, you don't need, nothing needs to be done to that person, they're going to go out and vote on their own. If they don't support, not likely to turn out, again, you can't do much about them. But if you're likely to support, low propensity to turn out, then you need some persuasion, you need some push to make sure you vote on election day. And if you are high turnout, but low on support, then you need persuasion. So you can actually slot people in this matrix. And then, but again, there's not enough data still available, or at least at that time, it wasn't. But those were the ideas. So those were the experiments, or those are the things which I tried to do. And a lot of it depended on the ground operation, that people had different candidates, including in the two constituencies that Modi fought, they would have, where there was a better ground organization, they would then be able to go out and do the door to door outreach. See, in India, one of the big problems is that candidates are typically not declared until three weeks before the elections, there are no primaries. So it's very hard to run a proper campaign, actually. So you need, I think there are a lot of systemic changes which need to happen for data and tech to have a much greater play in elections."

And that's pretty much, I guess, why you became involved in the first place, because you correctly felt that what India really needs is economic freedom. And this is not just an economic question, it's a humanitarian question, because millions have been in poverty for decades longer than should have been the case. And we badly need reforms and economic freedom. And here is a guy who is saying the right things, as we subsequently know, none of that happened. But along with his Vikas talk, there is also polarizing talk, there is also a lot of bigotry, a lot of which was, in fact, reflected in the site that you own, Neeti Central, which to me had two problems, and one issue, of course, was editorial content, because it would publish just about anything, and there wasn't enough discernment. But the other issue was that a huge chunk of Neeti Central content, for example, was bigoted, anti-Muslim Hindutva content, I say Hindutva as opposed to Hinduism, the two being very different, and not enough of sort of the Vikas economic content.

So, there needed to be an alternate platform, which really puts across an alternative viewpoint, which different people could use it to counter really what was happening. So, we did try and have a wide mix of A, trying to articulate what is wrong with the current narrative and putting out an alternate narrative. I mean, some people may have different views on the content, but our idea was very clear that we needed to get this out, because there was no space in the traditional print and TV media sites, and there were very few internet sites at that time, media, political media sites.

And to me, these are off a piece, these can't be separate things that if you really care about freedom, economic freedom, and personal freedoms kind of go together. And this is also why I was against the BJP even then, because the thing is that while they were talking about economic freedom, they really did not give a damn about the other freedoms, it seemed to me at the time today, of course, we both of us know in hindsight that they don't care about any kind of freedom and on economics are actually as left wing as their predecessors. I mean, they're all basically the same. But personally, how much of, for example, your concern for economic freedom comes from, I mean, do you support freedoms in all of these other contexts, or is your support of economic freedom something that comes out of saying that India is a poor country, we should be rich and economic freedom will get us there and for these consequentialist reasons,"

So, I am still learning on the freedom part, I've read a lot, when I educated myself in economics post 2014. So, my background has been in technology. So, I heard the terms like classical liberalism or libertarian or public choice after 2014, it was not before that. Even the term economic freedom really, what I understood the full meaning of it later on and not before that. I think, of course, like you said, a lot of these freedoms, they all go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other, though you can argue that countries like Singapore, countries like China have clamped down on political freedom allowed, at least some parts in China have allowed much greater economic freedom. I think in India, what we really need, because when you take this message out to people, here's the problem. When you go out and tell people that look, you need freedom, the answer you get back is, oh, but we are free. We got free on August 15, 1947. So, the word freedom itself, there is a big challenge in persuading people about the need for freedom. And most people don't have the same sort of intellectual capability to read and analyze why freedom is so important and the cornerstone for prosperity. So, when I thought about the problem, I said, rather than talk about freedom, which then gets you into independence and on a different track, let's start with prosperity. It's something which is tangible. India is a poor country. It has been deliberately kept poor over the past 70 years. And that is something which people can feel and understand that you should have been 10 times wealthier by now, but you are not. That is something which is easier to sell, to persuade people about, than to say that look, you need more freedom of speech or more individual freedom. That becomes a little harder problem. So, I said, let's start with the economic outcome that we want to talk about. And from there, then we can actually talk about all the other elements. They will all become natural elements which will flow into making the end happen."

        "message": "Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah. So, I think it started, the process, of course, was gradual. There were step functions, I think, in that process. But I think the first step was really the initial team that was put together as part of for the cabinet. I think till what was very interesting was that the campaign was essentially managed by a lot of people from the outside. But when it came to the team, the cabinet which was formed, and there was a lot of speculation between 16th May 2014 and 26th May when the cabinet was announced, there would be outsiders, there would be laterals. And I think it was a moment in time when there were a lot of people from India and abroad who I think if they had been tapped into and told that, look, the next three years, we'd like you to work for making Indians rich or making India prosperous, very few would have had hesitation in actually agreeing to something like this. So, the first problem which I saw was the talent that had been assembled. The second was the language. I think the language changed quite dramatically from pre-election, which was about aspirations, it was more of the neo-middle class term that Modi sort of used to talk about. And it became very quickly about the poor. And I think as we know, that the more you talk about the poor, and the more you try to do things specifically for the poor, you are basically ensuring that they will stay poor for the rest of their life. So, that was the second thing. Third was that I think we lost or Modi lost really the first 100 to 200 days, which was the time for dramatic change. And the agenda for what needed to get done, actually, if you want to make Indians rich is pretty clear. I mean, you got to undo the anti-prosperity machine which has been running for the past 70 years, whether it's in education, healthcare, labor, land, admin reforms, pretty much every sector of the economy, and none of that happened. So, I'm seeing the first five, six months, where it's basically a continuation. And the budget, I think the first budget which got presented in July, was effectively a rehash of the previous or the pointers in the budget or the economic survey were just rehash of the previous one. So, then where is the change? The second sort of event, which I think was concerning to me, was the response to the phrase Sootboot ki Sarkar. I mean, that happened probably in early 2015. And I think Modi turned decisively more socialist, more towards the left after that. So, the poor focus became a lot more heightened. What he really should have done, and I think the Modi who was the campaigner would probably have done this thing, but maybe the Modi, the Prime Minister did not look at it the same way. He should have come out and said that, look, of course, we want a Sootboot ki Sarkar. We want every Indian to be in a Sootboot. We want every Indian to be rich, so they have the choice of what they decide what to wear. But that did not happen. So, that was, I think, a huge missed opportunity, because after that, the economic slide sort of continues. And I think the next big sort of the breaking point really, in my mind, came with demonetization. Demonetization I think was, I mean, you know, no right thinking leader would inflict this on any country, on people. It was the largest, probably abuse of individual rights this country has ever seen and perhaps will ever see. And I remember having a phone call, phone chat on the day, the night the demonetization was announced and telling people, telling a few of my friends that this is India's road to serfdom, road to serfdom, as you all know, the Hayek book, I said, this is just not done. And even the reasons which were outlined, it is very clear, I mean, corruption does not happen when two individuals are transacting. Corruption happens when people have to interact with those in government or in the political"

And I'm really looking forward to that. Going back to demonetization, obviously, I agree with you entirely, at that time, I called it the largest assault on property rights in human history. And it was very Maoist more than anything else, I saw the parallels between Mao's great leap forward and demonetization very striking in this in the kind of social engineering that Modi was attempting, and I have a number of episodes on that, which will be linked from this.

I don't think any Indian politician really understands why India is poor. And therefore, what we need to do for prosperity. And that's the most fundamental issue, which really is there. And therefore, when they all come to power, it's more a continuation of what's happening. Because without having self beliefs on what creates prosperity, it's going to be continuity on what's happening. I think that remains the first challenge. The second is, of course, India's bureaucracy, really saddled with the same old ideas. The secretaries in Delhi are today probably 58 to 60. And with ideas which are 20, 30 years old, I mean, India never really has, where do you in India do we hear about Adam Smith, about Friedman, about Buchanan, about Hayek? These ideas aren't even taught in our schools and colleges in economics. So without that understanding, I think it's impossible for things to change. And more importantly, I think people have really no understanding without like you said about public choice. And I think that kind of education needs to be done. And it's actually a very simple idea. Once you explain it to people that look, the politician is not some saint who's different from you and me. The politician is basically just like you and me. And you look at your self interest, the politician does the same. The politician's self interest just happens to be staying in power, getting reelected. And once you use that lens, it actually becomes clear. But no one's taking this message out to people. Once we start doing this, I think we'll start creating a demand for change in the country. And so it's either, so where does change come from? It either comes from a leader who understands, which we did not have in this case, or from people who demand it, which also has not been there."

And I had studied the Reagan period, Reagan basically, there was a complete document prepared by Heritage Foundation on the changes that were required in the government at that time. And most of those changes were done, started at least the narrative and the change process was started early on. In India also, what happens is because of the continuity of or a continuous flow of assembly elections, you know, you are set back in one election, then you go back to sort of quaint old ideas, flawed old ideas of the past. And here was a person who could basically, I think, persuade the country on any idea. And to have missed out the first six months, I think is unpardonable, really, because that is where the country was primed for change. And in every sector, I mean, we had to loosen up, we had to give really economic freedom to people and Modi was the person who could have sold it. And that was the vote. He had the mandate. Again, like you said, the mandate was a majority. So he could get anything done in the Lok Sabha. Oil at that time was at like $40. You have a leader who can sell, I mean, this is a moment in time, which was really after a generation. I mean, this had not happened since 1984. And it completely blew the opportunity. And that really upset me quite a bit, because to make that change, I think you needed two things. One, you needed to have a deeper understanding of what creates prosperity. And second is you needed talent. You needed people different from the political class and the existing bureaucrats, because they all think pretty much the same way. And without laterals, without having lost the first three to six months, I think it was then very clear that it's a very uphill struggle and therefore it's not going to change."

So, when you talk of, so, it's very hard to pinpoint specific people. But essentially, what I'm saying is, needed a smaller number of people who basically understood or understand what creates prosperity, I think that was the single most important agenda for this country. I mean, we'll talk about it more when we, in the second half, but the big changes, I think, which needed to happen, I think number one is education. I mean, we have, I think, yet again, blown another five-year term, where we keep messing up on education. And this has happened now for 70 plus years, it started with Nehru, who did not get one generation of Indians educated. If one generation of Indians had been educated well, they will ensure that the next generation is educated better than they are. So, he invested in higher education at the cost of primary education. So, where was education? When you look at the corporate ideas in economic freedom, in terms of administrative reforms, the way the bureaucracy actually works, you look at getting rid of government presence in all of various sectors of the economy, I think we needed to just get the government out from all of those things. I mean, Vajpayee had done a little bit of that, but the government had no business being in any of these sectors. Essentially, again, all of it would have, these things would have happened, had there been an understanding of what creates prosperity, and there is only one path which creates prosperity. If you study the countries which have become rich, it's the path of limited government, it's free markets, it's free trade, it's individual freedom, it's a rule of law and property rights. This is the core mix. So, every policy should have been taken, keeping this framework in mind, policies which are non-discriminatory, policies which basically decentralize power closest to where the people are. But none of that actually happened because the core understanding was not there. So, without that core understanding, then you stick to, oh, so, it's essentially like, it's not like Warren Buffett type investing strategy, it is more like day trading."

I mean, my, the way I come to economic freedom is just saying that look, two consenting adults should be able to do whatever they want with each other, whether it is in a bedroom or in the marketplace, no one else has a moral right to get in the way this is a moral issue as much as a consequentialist one, but a lot of Indians wouldn't even agree with that basic premise that two consenting adults should do whatever they want with each other. There are all kinds of social and cultural norms, which are which we would consider problematic. And therefore, I would imagine that one of the things that you then say is that, okay, you know, if you look at the political marketplace, there's supply, there's demand, I need to change the demand side, I need to change the culture, and only then will, you know, politicians with those kinds of ideas actually come to power and do something about it, which therefore becomes then a sort of a long term project.

And the answer goes back to the rules that are there. There's nothing wrong with Indians, you take the same person from here, you put that person in America or Singapore, and in five years, they'll be doing incredibly well. So, there's nothing genetically or there's no DNA problem with Indians. So, there's obviously a problem with the external circumstances or in the external environment in which they're operating in. And the core set of rules are actually defined in the Indian constitution. And when we started studying the constitution, I think what was the shocking realization was that 242 out of 395 articles in the original constitution were pretty much lifted verbatim from the 1935 Government of India Act. Let's understand that the 1935 Government of India Act was written by a colonial power, the British, to subjugate and rule over Indians. And we kept two thirds of that, or we used that to become two thirds of our constitution. And once you go through the constitution of India, it's a the longest one. And length does not mean greatness or goodness at all. It's written by lawyers, readable only by lawyers. If then else's butts are all over the place, it's a pretty much unreadable document, can be interpreted in any different way. Most important, it basically puts the people as subservient to the government. That is, I think, the most fundamental problem. And then you compare it with the American constitution, which is effectively carried in a pocket, 20 amendments, only 25 odd amendments in 200 plus years, but written in a language a 10-year-old can read and understand. Simple example, you take article, the first amendment, basically, says Congress shall make no law, among other things, abridging freedom of speech. What it really means is that every person has the freedom of speech naturally. It's there with them, and Congress cannot make any law suppressing it or abridging it in any way. In India, if you read the 1700 word first amendment on the same theme, effectively, it says you can say what you want, as long as you don't disagree with what the government"

So, the larger task, if the constitution ever changes the way I would rather see it change, is if these ideas emerge from the culture itself and people demand freedom and people demand all of these things. And then you have sort of change coming forward."

So now to actually prove to them that they are unfree and what is the world that they are living in is actually not the right world is a very difficult exercise. And unlike when you look at the time of the American constitution, the people who drafted it were living away from the British guys and their freedoms were then being imposed, the British started imposing taxes, etc. on them and curtailing their freedoms. Unfortunately, in India, in 1947, the skin color of the rulers changed, but the real lives of people, the rules governing them, look at our penal code, and how many of them are still brought from the British era, we are still in place."

So, cities become a milking ground for collecting all the money and then redistributing it in in rural areas where all the votes are.

And in India, cities are in a miserable situation, because we have no decentralization of power and of funds. So, the decentralization, the rules, which were there in the constitution, don't mandate in the 74th amendment, they don't mandate, they leave it to the state to really decide if they want to give funds to the cities automatically or not. And of course, no chief minister will want to do that. So, the cities basically become completely under the thumb of the chief minister, who then appoints a commissioner. So, the elected people, the mayor and the corporators have very limited powers to really make any changes. And therefore, there is no accountability, either financial accountability or governance accountability. So, you have, Bombay has, Mumbai has basically some 20-30 agencies, we've got 60,000 crores sitting in a fixed deposit account, which could transform the city's infrastructure, but no one's doing anything about these things. So, it becomes basically dense of corruption, because everyone is looking at their own thing. We've made, we've compounded the problem with reservation of seats or for the 50% women thing where no corporator knows if in the next election, their seat is going to get reserved, become a reserved constituency for a woman. So, they want to make as much money as they can now. So, as much money as now. So, there's no incentive, absolutely. So, the rules, again, you look at the rules, which are there out here, the perverse set of incentives out there. So, the cities really should have been the magnets. I mean, we have 15 million people moving from rural areas to urban areas every year, 400 million people in the next 25 years. What kind of lives are we going to give them in cities, slums? We've all seen that in Mumbai, we are seeing that in many other cities. And it doesn't have to be that way. So, the cities really needed to be independent of the central government and the state government. And that's why we called it swatantra cities, free cities. But these are hard ideas to actually persuade people with, and we had limited budgets, we were not fighting the election, our thing was, and of course, the other problem in the election was that this is a decision which has to be made at the state government level.

Why don't you speak out against Modi? It would make a difference. Why don't you speak out publicly about your disillusionment, all the things that you basically said in this episode of the problems you have with him.

Some of it is urban mythology, which is built up. So, see, the point is that, what is it, I mean, I tend to look forward rather than back. So, my decision to support the BJP and Modi, whether it's in 2009 or after that, I think was the absolutely right decision at that point of time. Given the information available. I think given what the country needed at that point of time, given the information available. And of course, what I knew, and it was a decision which I made and a lot of the country made at that particular point of time. I think I perhaps was a little more wedded to the decision or I thought a lot more about the decision because I was quite involved in the campaign. But one decision which I did make was that, okay, what's past is past, we need to look forward. And by being critical of Modi or by saying that he should have done this, he should have done that, I don't think it solves the problem. I think what we really need to look at, and that's what I've spent the last year, year and a half thinking through, I think it's very easy to criticize, okay, but then what is your alternative? That's what everyone comes down to even today, saying that, okay, so you don't want to vote for Modi. What is your alternative? Whom are you going to vote for? And that is the question which really drove me, saying that, can we come up with a credible alternative to not just Modi, but the current set of political parties, because like you said earlier, it doesn't make a difference who's in power. On the economic side, they're all the same. On the political and other freedom side, some are on one side, some are on the other side. But effectively, they are all running what I call PPP, you know, planned perpetual poverty."

I mean, if you actually look, police stations, parliament, the judiciary, the army, I mean, there is no logic. Let's take a simple example. Navinagar in Mumbai, it was fine in 1790s when it was set up. It was fine till 1946 or early 1947 when it should have been there. What is the logic for having it right now? It's basically become a lifestyle center, the best golf course, the best wedding venue and so on. But this is place where we need, we should be having economic activity. You know, people should be not having to commute three hours in every day, they should be getting whether it's affordable homes, whether it's educational colleges, whether it's offices, all of that should be happening because that is what creates wealth. So, our point is that if you want to eliminate poverty in India, you need to start getting all of these surplus assets into production, into use, and that then creates wealth. So, you monetize all of these assets, and then you return the wealth back to people. So, that then has the other benefit. So, other than being under the government, because the government basically we all know there's a lot of wastage, which is there. I mean, now government just raided the National Small Savings Fund to put money into Air India. So, all of this started to keep happening, because this is the actual wealth of the people. So, it is pathetic that, you know, we keep people poor, and then, of course, they don't even know that they have access to a large sum of money, which is their own, it is their own wealth. All that we are seeing is start returning it back to them, so they can craft their own path to prosperity."

So, for land, for public sector undertakings, I mean, some of the corporations are not even held publicly, like LIC, and the India Post are still not listed, so we have no way of estimating wealth. You take entities like Coal India, they should actually be worth probably 10 times what they are worth today, because Coal India is looted three ways. First, the government loots them from all the profits that they make, they make them dividend it out to the government. Second is, it's the most overstaffed, one of the most overstaffed organizations, so the employees are, in theory, looting it. And then you have the contractors and the politicians when the coal starts flowing out. So, there is no reason really for anyone to buy Coal India stock, theoretically. On the other hand, you have in Saudi Arabia, you have Aramco, which is worth a trillion and a half or $2 trillion, and here we have Coal India, which is worth $25 billion, having one of the largest coal reserves in the world. So, in the hands of government, these assets are really not worth much, put them in private hands. So, how do you do this? We've written out a Dhanwapasi bill, which we've sent to the Prime Minister and to every Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha MP, a bill which can actually be introduced in the Lok Sabha and passed. And it gives a four-stage process of how you generate the wealth. First is identifying the resources, of course, we've done it at our level, but presumably government sources will have a lot more info, so identify, restructure them, so in the way that they can be most optimized for private use, get all the permissions in place, get all the land titles clear, so there's no litigation afterwards, clear property, clear asset. And third is auction. And fourth is, as the monies come in, you're putting them into a fund from where it can be returned. So, this is how the wealth is getting created or generated from all of these public assets. How do you deliver? The second part is how do you get it across to people?"

So, the first part of it is really how the assets are identified. The process of auction is a transparent process. And look at what's happening today. Today, these assets are sitting with the government. They are either picked up by some of their friends, crony people, or they are just wasted. So, you have effectively, you have a plot of land, which is sitting idle, and then you have five unemployed people sitting somewhere away. Now, you put these five people on work on the land, they will create wealth. But today, if they are sitting idle, there's no wealth creation, which is happening. Simple example here. So, my belief is that this is at least a starting point. If there are better solutions, I think we are definitely open to ideas from the outside on what can be done better.

And there are two answers to it. First is that every person, every citizen of India has an equal right on the wealth of the country. So it does not matter how rich or poor you are, you have a right. And the beggar at the traffic signal should get the same as Mukesh Ambani. Same as, it's the equal share in the wealth. Second is why universal? Because it just makes sense, of course, everyone should get it. And then you don't want to create another bureaucracy with corruption, trying to identify should Amit get it and should Rajesh get it? So what is your income? What is your BPL line and all of those things? Nothing. So everyone gets it, you don't need bureaucracies to identify who should get it, who should not get it. And the process of returning it can be through bank accounts, possibly linked, of course, linked with Aadhaar. DBT today is anyway happening to roughly a few hundred million people, probably close to 500 million people in all the various governments, direct benefit transfers already happening. I say is that, you know, the Election Commission can hold an election in 30 days and reach out to every Indian who does not have to walk more than 10 minutes to actually go cast a vote. So the people who are left out from the bank account creation, I think we can have one exercise which lets people create a bank account and you don't need a physical branch, you can do phone banking, equivalent, all of these possibilities are there. I mean, there's a significant economic incentive for a family when they're going to get one lakh rupees to actually go and get a bank account. All you have to do is to generate the awareness. And these are the poorest families in India would probably be saving not more than 10, 20,000 rupees, like we said earlier, debt."

It's not a lifetime commitment that we are making. This is still, the wealth is there, what is generated from there, till we are giving it back. We are seeing as of today that the wealth is 50 lakh rupees in the surplus wealth. So potentially one lakh can be given for 50 years, it may be more, it may be a little bit less. But my feeling is that after 5 to 10 years, it will not make much of a difference to most people. Because by that time, they would have all started creating their own path to prosperity and their incomes would be, or their wealth would be a multiple, where this may not make as much of a difference. But we have to kickstart this process, we have to free up this wealth and get it out in the hands of people. I think that's very important. UBI has been used in developed countries more as a solution against the automation and the jobs crisis that is there. This idea is really new and innovative because it's about the public wealth. It's about the wealth, which, I mean, frankly, most people don't even know. We all, like you said in the beginning, it's owned by the government. But what is owned by government? Government ownership means it's actually government control. But we seem to separate out, you know, it's owned by the government, so you can't be touched as if the government was this massive monolith."

And therefore, what I would call fake rights is that you take money from X set of people and redistribute it to Y set of people, which is what UBI basically is. Absolutely. You tax everybody and then you give everybody UBI out of that. And of course, there is much leakage within the system. But what you're saying is not that there is no coercion involved here.

In fact, I should have added this earlier that UBI in most countries, all the countries that have been talked about is funded by taxation. In fact, here, and we've written this out in our prosperity agenda on our site, where non-wapasi is one of the key pillars, of course, for prosperity. With this, we can actually reduce taxes for everyone to keep more money in people's hands. They are the best decision makers on what to do with the money that is there. The government should get a limited amount of money, which it spends on a limited number of things. Today, what's happening is that the government appetite for collecting is going up much more. I mean, all these cesses and all of these additional things get squeezed in. So, it's death by a thousand taxation cuts that is there. And the scope of what the government does keeps growing. And we are heading down the completely wrong path. So, whatever the government needs, they should collect through taxes. So, there's a very transparent mechanism of running the government saying that, okay, this is how much we collected and this is how we have spent it. But they're not taking that money and trying to spend it on 25,000 other things that they should not be doing. India needs a better judicial system. India needs a better police force. India needs a better equipped army or defense forces. We today don't even have the money to buy arms if we have to protect our borders. Those are the core functions of a government. Protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, law and order, and so on. But today, because the government does 25,000 other things, they are not even able to do those core things that they should be doing, which others cannot. They're not doing that."

In fact, the wiki, we have a booklet, there's a manifesto and the bill. So, all these links will be in the episode page then? So, the current sort of MPs are not going to do it. So, how do we make it happen? This is not just a theoretical idea which is left out there and then no one does it. What we really want to do, and that's the process that we've started with the second part of, so there's an economic idea, there's the political part of it also, which is that we don't even have political freedom actually in the country. We may call ourselves a democracy, but whom are we voting for? We are basically voting for those people whom the political party bosses decide. We have no ability to select the candidate from a political party whom we support in our own constituency. They put up the person, so now that candidate's loyalty or that MP's loyalty is towards the political party bosses, not towards the local people. So, our idea is that how can we create a technology platform? So, again use technology to bring in change in the political process. Technology has impacted a lot of other areas, it's not touched the political part. So, how can you use technology to select and elect a government of independent candidates chosen by the people through primaries in the next election? And these are the people then who are elected on a Dhanwapasi plank, that they will pass the Dhanwapasi bill, and once you start the process of doing Dhanwapasi, government starts a lot of other side effects which take place like we discussed. The process of shrinking government will begin. Now, how do we make this happen? So, what we've done, what our thinking is that, and that's what I was saying earlier on that, there's a very interesting opportunity right now, that there needs to be an alternative. So, the way I like to sort of frame it is that the political parties are built on a premise of dhoka, basically betrayal. You make promises and they have no intention of keeping, it's all for the purpose of getting into power. And all you have a choice is between one type A of dhoka or type B of dhoka. That's what you're going to get. We have seen it election after election through the years, but that's the choice that people have had in the past. What we are saying is that let's create another option, which is different from the political party. So, it's not about creating a new political party, it's creating a tech platform, which lets individuals who like this idea, who want dhanwapasi to happen, come together with candidates, with leaders who actually want to make dhanwapasi happen, who want to get elected to the Lok Sabha. So, it also brings down the cost of entering politics, cost of winning elections, because now you no longer have to rely on your political party godfathers and give them a lot of money to come into power, which sort of vitiates the entire system. As members come, just like Ola and Uber, it's a two-sided platform, you have drivers and you have passengers who connect through a tech platform. Today, we have enough phones and smartphones across the country to actually think about ideas like this. So, if, say, I want to contest elections, I can do that, of course, as an independent, but I'm not going to get more than a handful of votes, because who knows me, and so it's a waste of your deposit, security deposit. But now, if I want to contest elections, I can come on the dhanwapasi platform and say, yes, I want to be a leader, and there, we have a mechanism by which you can earn points. The top five people become the candidates for a primary in that constituency, where people can vote for them, they can rate them, review them. Someone can come in and say, hey, Rajesh, I know Rajesh, he was a BJP supporter. So, I can comment on that back, but it's a transparent process. You're not hiding, nothing gets hidden, because you're also tapping into the wisdom of crowds really out there. So, just like Zomato reviews or Amazon product reviews, they're all out there. I have to then be accountable to the people. So, you have primaries where the candidate then gets selected, and then, hopefully, because there's a large membership base, the likelihood of that person winning is very high. And I want to add one more thing out here. What's very interesting, if you actually look at the numbers, there should be 100 crore eligible voters in the next election in six to eight months' time, 30 crore, only 30 crore are hardcore supporters of BJP, Congress, and the regional parties. So, those are people who will go out, vote on the symbol that is there. They're not going to sit at home, they don't care about the candidate. The other 70 crore are unattached to any political party. They are either not voting, they're not registered to vote, they are wasting their vote, or they're deciding at the last minute whom to vote for. Our goal is that if this 70 crore, people can be persuaded that there is an economic incentive where you get your wealth back, and as a political part of it, where you get your voice back. And for the first time, you really will have a say in the future of this country. You have a voice as part, of course, of a large group, you have your voice, which comes back to you. You are not now hostage to the political party bosses, where two people sitting in Delhi are making all decisions, does not matter what you think. So it's sort of a revolution on both the political side and on the economic side, because you can't do one without the other. I can put the economic idea out, it's not going to happen, unless, and that was the big learning from the Mumbai corporation elections. And the solution is not creating another political party, because then we will go down the same path where there'll be two people at the top trying to decide. You've seen that happen with, for example, Aam Aadmi Party, where it went down the same way. So how do you think it bottom up, where, how do you return in a way the voice and wealth of the people? How do you make people politically free and give them economic freedom?"

And eventually, from this interaction between voters and politicians, you will winnow out a person in each constituency, who will then represent the platform, but not a political party per se. And the only thing about this platform, which is a given is that this platform stands for Dhanwapsi. So all these voters are people who want Dhanwapsi to happen.

But the core agenda is towards this. So our thinking is that can we, in the next election, create a Lok Sabha of 272 plus, so the majority, are independent candidates who support Dhanwapsi and therefore we can get the Dhanwapsi bill passed as we go forward.

So I don't have to rely on sort of the existing media channels or any of those to get an idea across and it really has to be created as a people's movement. So the key parameter for success or the key, the one path for us to succeed is this idea has to go viral and there's an economic incentive actually for both members and for candidates to spread it. What we are saying is for members, when you register, you get a Dhanwapsi date exactly one year from the day you sign up. So the earlier you sign up, the earlier will be your date when your family will get back 1 lakh rupees."

The second part of it is that if you now help sign up other people, your date advances by a day for every person you sign up. So we've gamified this a little bit, again, incentives work, we all know that. So if you are a person who has connected with other people, the 1 lakh rupees means a lot for your family, you will want to then sign up on this platform, there is no downside to it. Even a lottery ticket that you buy actually costs you money. Here, there is no downside to it.

And that's why we see some of the MPs that we see, you don't even see them after the election campaign over the next few years. What we are saying now is that if there are a lot of people who want to get into politics for the right reasons, where making money, being corrupt and just exercising hardcore power is not the primary objective or is not the objective. For these people, today, there is an alternate way, which does not require a lot of funds. It democratizes or opens up politics, just as Ola did. If you have a car and you want to make some money driving it around, you can do that. Of course, we've banned that particular element in India, but worldwide, that's the place for Uber, for example. You have a few hours, you've got a vehicle, you just sign up on the platform. So, it opens up the access to the platform. This is what we are doing out here. And people can then essentially, and by primaries, it makes the process very transparent and open. And even in the primaries, we have set two more conditions. We've said that we will only do primaries if we have a 5% plus support base in our constituency. So unless there are a lack of people in a typical 20 lakh constituency, there are no primaries, there is no candidate. And second is the winning candidate must have 50% or more of the support base.

Negative subsidies. Negative subsidies. Like you said it earlier. So, I said among all of the ideas which were there, and there are many themes which we had discussed when I used to think about this, it's like an entrepreneur, okay, there is a political marketplace, we are introducing competition in the political marketplace. And what should my product be like? And I said this theme around prosperity, this idea around that there is your wealth which can be returned back to you, came across to me as a very, very powerful idea. And in the last two and a half months, I released the first video on August 15th, which talked about this idea. It's very interesting. We've had two types of reactions from people. So, the intellectual elite have come back to me and said, Rajesh, how are you going to make it happen? You know, all these land permissions are there, this permission is there, nothing gets really ever done in India. It's never going to be possible to do it. But then there's a completely different other set of group, which I would categorize as the mass. They are coming and saying, when will I get my one lakh rupees? So, this theme of, you know, that this is their money, it's getting in, it's spreading. Now, it's at least spreading as in it's touching people, that this is mine, I should get it back and it will make a significant difference to my life. It gives me an escape path from the bad or suboptimal situation that I am in. And the fact that this is my right, that is, I think, very important to bring out here, that this is not another government scheme, where they are giving out this kind of money by redistributing it from taxes that they raise otherwise.

Isn't there then a danger that this will be hijacked? Because the only thing that a candidate really needs to say is he needs to say, I believe in dhanwapasi. And beyond that, his framing can be absolutely anything. And you don't even know whether he really believes in dhanwapasi. So you can have like Modi made a lot of opportunistic noises about economic freedom before 2014. And people were taken in by that and voted for him and he turned out to be something else entirely. You know, as you said, this is like a crowdsourcing, no one owns this whole process, you want it to be bottoms up. How can you say that the process won't be hijacked, for example, by people who might say yeah, dhanwapasi is a good idea.

So the extreme that you have right now is two people decide the entire existing set of MPs are basically just administrators of MP lad funds, which they get, they have no real power, no real authority to do anything, because otherwise, if they violate what the party tells them to vote for, they're ejected and thrown out. Look at the US system, the Republicans and Democrats, people get elected on one of these two tickets, but they are free to decide on every vote on every issue on their own. So there is no core, possibly maybe other than maybe finance matters, the budget or whatever, there is no real whip that is holding them on this, but they are accountable to their constituents. What we are saying here is that if you are going to do things which is against the will of the people, and you have to rely on the will of the people at the end of the day, that is the choice that we have made in India. If you are going to do, they are going to be up in arms against you, you are accountable to them, that's first. Second is, I think once people taste economic freedom, and because of that, the other freedoms, I think there is no going back. See, we've never had, you know, it's like we've never really had Indians exposed to real freedom, you know, where you are not held hostage by some government bureaucrat for like 20 permissions that you need for doing something, and so on. I mean, the rules, regulations in India just keep going up in every sphere that is there. And the government has become, like you said earlier, a predation machine. It keeps extracting because its desire to gather votes and please people is going up. Like what we have seen currently happen in the dispute between the government and RBI on what to do with the big chunk of RBI reserves, you know, which really technically is the wealth of the people, but they are fighting over it as if it's their pool of money to distribute the way they want. So, I think what needs to happen here is that you can bring in what people want through the mechanism of technology. And where it is happening actually is in Italy, the five-star movement, even though that's a populist movement. So, they came to power on a populist principle, but forget that part for now. They are essentially using the app, the five-star app, using technology to source inputs from people on bills, on legislation, etc. So, there is a way by which you can make this happen through technology, there is discussion which happens. Today, there is no voice that people have at all. We may make some wrong decisions, but then the candidate has to come back and face his constituents and then they will decide, look, you did not do the right thing, we will vote you out. So, I think this is the natural process of corrective democracy, which will be there. But let's at least experience that. And my belief is as long as we go through the dhanvapasi, even if just dhanvapasi gets done, I think in five years, you will have a very different country. You will have a significant reduction in the powers and the resources that the government has and it's an irreversible. After that, they cannot grow it again. And that will really set Indians free.

I said, how is it that I look inside a person and say, what are your core beliefs and all of these things? You can't do that. So, keep the big idea as big enough that it will prevent a lot of other bad things from happening and you can't really, you know, like you said earlier, people could sign up for anything. So, it's very difficult for me to force that corrective mechanism has to be with the voters in the constituency themselves who are selecting the candidate. And therefore, it's not a very small electoral college, it's not 10 people deciding who the candidate should be. It's a very large electoral college, which is deciding who the candidate should be. And if they make mistakes, well, they'll correct it in the next election."

But then the question is, these are all independents, they're not part of a party, their views to your tech platform, but they're not actually part of the same organization."

Okay, so think of this as if we are successful, it's a government of 272 plus whatever number singleton parties, every party with a single candidate, because every candidate is theoretically independent. But we have seen this picture before. This is exactly how the US Senate, how the US Congress work and in many other countries, it's the same way that it works. What happens, even when the president or whoever proposes something, they have to get persuaded whether to support that particular bill or policy. And for that, they are taking inputs from their constituents, which is what we want to make happen. Technology just makes this whole process easier. I agree, this is not perfect. And we will probably take, we'll see how to how it gets refined and how it becomes better. But look at what we have today. Today, we have effectively, like I said, in one of my earlier videos, we have a kakistocracy. Kakistocracy is a government by the worst of the most unscrupulous people. We had that for the last 70 years. People who have no incentive, no interest in doing the things to get out of the way of Indians who want to prosper for themselves. And that's the core idea that everyone, every family has. But we put hurdles, whether it's farmers, whether it's entrepreneurs, whether it's businessmen going about their lives genuinely, whether it's kids wanting to get educated. I mean, look at, but that is what we have today, because it's two people who have no understanding of what creates prosperity and does not matter which party they are, if it's one or two people deciding what should be the core policies or whatever it is there. Maybe this is another extreme, but let's at least try something different for the next five years, 10 years, because we know the path we are on right now. If you're going to stick on that path, we know the outcomes. India is not going to become rich today. Every Indian family who has 18 year old kid and who has two crores in the bank, they want to send their kid outside of India for education."

There are resources which are there. So that's one track. And second is, I will then want to also increase the education process. Then we have five years or N years, whatever, three to five years, depending on what type of government gets formed. To persuade people that there is an alternate path to prosperity. I recognize that the time is limited right now, but I also know from my previous experience that the period just before an election, the six to eight months before an election is probably 10 times heightened awareness than is the peace time, the four and a half years in between. So I think it's a great time to actually put an alternative out to people. And I think we will get learnings. So my sense is we'll have one of two outcomes, either we fail spectacularly, okay, in which case we don't get any interaction, or if this becomes a force, then I think it is unstoppable. Because like the network effects, which will be inbuilt into what we have, are going to be something which no political party will be able to stop. It's a genuine people's movement."

And you've built that core into a very successful company, and you have that track record of success. And no matter how outlandish your ideas, people kind of listen to you and sort of give you that space. And you've brought many of your principles of tech entrepreneurship into political entrepreneurship. One of those seems to be that don't agitate too much and get an idea perfect, just go out with it and see what happens and throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. What are the sort of like, are there similarities between tech entrepreneurship and political entrepreneurship? Like, how do you think about it?"

        "message": "Yeah, see, at least the way I've been thinking about this is first is, have a big idea. The odds of success or failure don't change, because you've got to get a million decisions right in anything that you do to succeed. So might as well go for the moon, in terms of the idea that you have. So when I started India World, the idea at that time was not just to create a news and information portal, but how do you build an electronic marketplace which connected Indians worldwide? When I talked about in the political space with the BJP, I did not say that, okay, let's move the needle from 182 seats to 210 seats or 220 seats, I said, how does the BJP get a majority on its own, because the strategy then becomes very different. So here it's not about saying that, look, let's try and get five independent candidates into the Lok Sabha, which will actually make no difference at all. So first is make big plans, because they are the only ones which can really inspire other people to action. That's one. Second is, how do you use technology as a game changer? Technology is the only thing I really know in my life. And in every place I've tried to use, look ahead and see what are the things that technology can do, which we can apply. And when I looked at the political space, I said, okay, this is the Dhanvapasi idea was there, but then I had to make it into something which is actionable. And that is where this idea of platform technology comes in. Over the last many years, we've seen platforms emerge. So like Facebook, Google, they're all platforms, they're connecting two sides together. And I said, the same thing can be applied here. So instead of trying to create another political party with me at the top, trying to recruit people, I said, how do I know who in a constituency in Kerala would be the right candidate? So you flip the whole thing around, which is what Uber, Ola, all of these marketplace type platforms are actually doing. So the technology in this case is this, but in every place, how do you use technology to really make a difference, be the disruptor really? And the third thing is, don't worry about failure. I failed enough times in my life, every failure teaches, because if you think about, okay, how impossible the mountain is, or how impossible the mission is, you are not going to climb. There's a very nice title of a book, Mountains Beyond Mountains. And when I read it, it by Tracy Kidder, basically, it's a Haitian proverb, but it's only when you climb one mountain, that you see that there is another mountain beyond it. But if you knew if you sat at the bottom and saw how high the mountain is, you probably not start climbing it at all. So my approach in this is to get started. Like you said, you try out different things, and you learn every day, can you become better every day? What an entrepreneur really does is not aim for massive success. You're going into work every day, trying to reduce your chances of failure."
