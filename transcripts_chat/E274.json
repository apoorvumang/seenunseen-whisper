I look around and I see much that is breaking and is fresh in our minds but will seem normal tomorrow and I also see so much that has been wrong for 75 years and we don't even think of it as a problem because it's part of the fabric of our lives. If we are lucky enough to be well off, the world outside our bubble is unseen to us. There is so much shit going on around us that we have normalised. There is no rule of law in this country for most people, women are second class citizens, our education system is broken, healthcare is broken, the legal system is broken, we still have the wild caste system with us, 3000 children still die of starvation every day, a quarter of our kids are still malnourished and at this moment in time, our society is being torn apart by anti-Muslim bigots who are destroying all that is best about India. And even if we sometimes do protest some of this, we get tired, we get back to our lives, the old abnormal becomes a new normal. It is what it is. That is why, on this show at least, I try to keep outraging, keep dissenting, maybe against a regime, maybe against a conventional way of thinking, maybe just against bad economics which is almost written into India's DNA. A couple of times a year, I get economists together and do an episode to take stock of the economy. Our problems are chronic, so it might seem like we keep saying the same things, repackaging the same old laments, but I believe it is important to do so. We cannot take the injustice of this world for granted. And a lot of this injustice has to do with economics. Bad economics kept hundreds of millions of people in India in poverty for decades longer than necessary. Bad economics is responsible for people slipping back into poverty today. Bad economics has humanitarian"

        "message": "Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen. My guests today are the economists Rajeshwari Sengupta and Shreyana Bhattacharya, both of whom have been my guests before and have recorded memorable episodes with me. I recorded an episode on the GDP with Rajeshwari, how GDP is flawed in concept and messed up in practice, especially in India. Besides that powerful primer, we also did an episode where she and I and two other guests laid out our dream reforms for India. And Shreyana appeared on an episode from earlier this year called The Loneliness of the Indian Woman, which has since become one of the most popular episodes of the show and has struck a chord with so many people everywhere. If you haven't already heard it, I recommend you listen. So many TIL moments. Now, when I heard Shreyana was coming to Bombay, I thought it was a perfect chance to do a state of the economy kind of episode with her and Rajeshwari. Once they both agreed, I realised that we now had the most Bengalis that had ever been inside my home studio. They're both bong, I'm half bong, so that's two and a half bongs, which is appropriate for this episode because I wanted it to be like an adda. No structure, just chill together, ramble, talk about this and that, let it flow. We ended up speaking about economics, society, the imposter syndrome, how women manage in a male-dominated profession, how inflation affects women in a greater way than men, the problems with academia and Delhi high society, and so on. We answered a few questions that had been posed to us on Twitter. And at one point, we were disturbed by the loud sound of a drill from somewhere, which my brilliant editor Gaurav Chintamani managed to hide completely, but it still rattled us and I had to stop and figure out which flat it was coming from and get them to chill, and so on and so forth. You'll hear about that also in the episode. So well, I mean, enjoy the conversation. But before that, let's take a quick commercial break. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means I read more books, but also read more long form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place for us? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ compounds, which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of the programs called the Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models to even marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ compounds at ctqcompounds.com slash unseen and check out the Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. Future Stack batches start every Saturday. What's more, you get a discount of a whopping 2500 if you use the discount code unseen. So hey, head on over to CTQ compounds at ctqcompounds.com slash unseen. Don't forget the slash unseen and use the code unseen. Uplevel yourselves. Shrayana and Rajeshwari, welcome to the scene and the unseen."

And while you and I have done a couple of episodes before, we haven't done that part of it. And I'm thinking, OK, I know how she thinks, but I don't know me. But I don't know you. And I'd like you to start by telling me about your recent holiday, because just before this recording, you were telling me about this post-apocalyptic landscape you went to, where you were in the middle of the sea and there was no water, which is so fascinating.

So over the long weekend, we just decided to and we have been doing a lot of road trips during the lockdown since we couldn't go anywhere else. And this is the first time we started exploring Maharashtra, despite having lived in Bombay for the last seven years. So we decided that we've been almost everywhere that people usually go to. And there's one place that is left that we have been hearing a lot about, and that's Bordi and Dahanu. So we decided to go there, a bunch of three families with all our kids and everything. And little did we realize, of course, that Bordi and Dahanu are closer to the Gujarat border, which means it's incredibly hot. But still, we went. And so one of the main attractions of Bordi is the beach. So we go to the beach the evening of the day when we reach the place and we find that there's a low tide. Now, what we know of low tide from places like Juhu Beach, etc. is that the water recedes a little bit and then after a point it comes back, right? Whereas on Bordi Beach, we discovered that the sea has literally retreated more than 12 to 15 kilometers, if not more. So you can't see the water at all standing on the beach. And what you see is kilometer and kilometer of what looks like mirage, right? Because there's a shimmery because of the sun, the setting sun, the little bit of shimmering on the surface, because it's all watery mud, because the sea has retreated. And it's all slush and black earth kind of thing. And you can keep walking for about 10-12 kilometers on the seabed, yet not reach the sea. And there was nobody else around, it was just us. So exactly as I said, it really felt apocalyptic, because in the sense that you feel that it's the end of the world, and the sea has retreated somewhere far away, and you can't reach it. And at least for me, I felt this irresistible pull that I have to keep walking towards the sea to find how far the water is. So we kept walking and after a point of time, I think we walked quite a bit. And it was just us in the middle of this vast seabed with no water anywhere. And the actual beach is far away, the water is somewhere else, and we were in the middle of nowhere literally. So it was a surreal feeling. And that ended up being my definition of having fun in Bodhi. But it was fascinating. I have not seen something like this ever before. And then we went back the next day to see the sea has to come back at some point of time. And it did, the high tide was spectacular as well. So that was my long weekend, basically."

He made a series of 10 films for Polish television in 91 or 90 or something like that called Decalogue, with each film being on one of the 10 commandments. And the first of those was called Thou shalt have no other God than me. It was based on that commandment. And obviously, I don't even think he's necessarily a believer, but it was just interesting reinterpretations. And it's about a guy whose, you know, son wants to go skating in a lake that has just gotten frozen up and he's complete scientific temperament and he does a math and everything. So he figures out exactly that it is not safe today, it is not safe tomorrow, it is safe on Wednesday, because that's where the temperature will be and you can go skating and nothing will happen and all of that. And not to give it, I mean, the spoiler doesn't matter because it's just such a great film and I watch it again and again. His son goes out and drowns, the ice breaks. And then the last shot of that little short film is that while he's at the edge of the water, and he's thinking about his son, in the distance, he sees as a homeless tramp who's lit a fire by the side of the lake. Ouch. You know, so if you get the connection with Thou shalt have no other God but me, just tremendous. And when you were speaking of doing calculations of what time the high tide"

Should I go with the wife? Should I go with the daughter? So I think he also went more towards the beach. But then for me, it was just, I mean, you know, you just felt, you just feel like you keep walking and whatever happens happens. I mean, at some point you just hit the sea, nothing more happens. But it's just that the time, it's just so far away, you keep walking and then it can get dark, the high tide can come, you may not have enough time to walk back, all of those things.

One day you have a you know, a lockdown that is announced with a four hours notice to the utmost misery of most people. And then one day you have like a GST, which is implemented with the shoddiest possible manner. There's always something or the other happening. And I just feel that it's difficult to almost keep pace with how things are changing. And it's like last year, we were thinking of the pandemic and the pandemic is receding, and the economy is going to come out of it. And then bang, you get hit by geopolitical Russia-Ukraine war, then bang, you have US inflation higher than in the last 40 years. There's constantly something or the other happening. So I think there is, I mean, I don't get bored with the discourse, I think primarily because in India, there is just so many shocks and so many policies gone wrong."

There has been an effort to keep, I mean, if I may call them experts, or whatever you want to call them, right? There has been a conscious effort to keep them at bay, to keep them away, and to not involve them in any kind of decision making, any kind of policy analysis. And we have seen an exodus of people from India, we have seen all the other economists have just withdrawn in their own echo chambers, and we are just talking to each other, because nobody's interested to talk to us. And that is something that I think the authorities and the policymakers have done, and they have taken this decision that we don't want to engage with them anymore. But I also think that this is a wave. I mean, again, I have a very long term view of things. And I think it is a wave, and over a period of time, when they do realize that things are getting really, really bad, and it's already happening. At some point, you have to start engaging with experts, you have to start engaging with the economists and understand what exactly what are the ideas they're talking about. I mean, 1991 reforms happened. And imagine the way they happened till 1991, nobody was really paying attention to that side of economics, so to speak, and then boom, it happened. And they had every incentive to roll back the reforms once the crisis was averted, and they did not. They stuck to the reforms, and they sustained the energy and the momentum of the reforms. And I think economists played a fairly important role then. And since then, I think from 2010 onwards, particularly, there has been a, you know, sort of slow withdrawal from expertise, from specialization, from any kind of intellectual discourse. And I'm hoping at least that that's another wave and soon they will have to realize that this is not working out."

It's a very powerful example of, well, we knew the ideas, but then it took sort of a whole set. It's an apparatus, right, that has to act and then has to implement and roll out and check whether the rollout is working in a certain direction. I'm not sure, I think looking at the current state of affairs, where that apparatus right now lies. So I don't think, and to me, remember, I mean, it's not just about economics in academic economics. I'm thinking of the Indian Economic Service. I'm thinking of economists within the apparatus who are supposed to form this crux of a core constituency that will fight for reform within. And I think that's where I see a lot more despondency, just informally, what one sees when one is interacting with government agencies, and just the general discourse. And so what worries me sometimes is I almost feel that there's now currently like an incentive to live in even deeper bubbles, more energetic and energized bubbles, because it's wonderful then to be in that bubble and find like minded people who you can talk to. But I think beyond those individual, I wouldn't even call them echo chambers, because I think that's doing a disservice. I think they are bubbles of thoughts and very important thoughts. But I just don't know beyond that. I mean, you remember, there was that fabulous book that came out, I'm going to say before the pandemic, it had essays by people like Pranjul Bhandari and Raghuram Rajan and Abhijit, on sort of all kinds of things that you could do with the economy, really useful suggestions, and very concrete, actually, it was a very refreshing book, because they really made it. I actually now almost wondered, you know, if you just go back to those texts and just see, well, how much of what was low hanging fruit has happened or not happened, I think we'll find very dismal results. And I don't think the reason is academic economists are not energized and enthusiastic. I think there's a whole community that's doing economics and the job of economic policymaking and decision making, which lies within government, lies within local think tanks, support groups, lobbies, I think it's a very complex set of actors. And there, I almost sense that there's a lot of parroting of the words and the tropes. But the conviction perhaps, maybe conviction is a very strong word, but the zeal to sort of say, we need to do this. I don't know where"

There is also the element that, at least again, in the last few years, the way things have evolved is that if you, let's say, believe in something, an economic policy or an economic recommendation, it need not, just on the merit of the economic argument, it may not be accepted as long as it doesn't echo with the sort of what I call the quote unquote party line, right? I mean, unless you are really talking in terms of what they want to hear, unless you are really saying, you're sort of playing to the gallery, even if there is an economic merit to the argument, they don't want to hear it. And they're going to choose the arguments of the people who are talking about stuff that they want to hear. Now, be that as it may, I think at the same time, it is very important to keep talking about the ideas and keep discussing and debating everything that we are doing. Because, as I said, at some point of time, the need to pay attention to this will also be felt. I'm saying that it is easy to feel despondent because we are not heard or, I mean, people don't hear us, our voice is not being heard about. But then, at the same time, I think a time will come that they will realize that this is not working and we have to do some course correction. And so what are the ideas lying out there on the table and how much of that can be adopted? So I think, I mean, for the sake of that future optimism, we just have to keep discussing and debating and not give up. Because if we give up, that's almost like what they want us to do.

        "message": "So, in fact, Amit, if I may add one point here is that we are thinking of our usefulness from a policy perspective. I think that's taking a bit of a narrow view of what economists in any field can do. Fine, maybe we are no longer a part of the Delhi North Block and South Block and whatever RBI where we used to be called at one point of time for policy discussions. But there is also a larger role that we have in terms of influencing minds and informing people, creating knowledge and diffusing knowledge. Right. So the way I look at it is, let's say you're creating knowledge or diffusing knowledge and you're trying to fix the world in whichever small teeny weeny bit you want to do it. Maybe the last part of it is a little bit broken because you don't have access to the real world policymaking process, but you still have the responsibility of creating and diffusing knowledge and diffusing ideas and then shaping people's opinions, forming opinions. For example, what I do a lot with my students, now that I'm not obviously getting engaged in the policymaking process, I engage a lot with my students because these are 21, 22 year olds and they are curious, they're hungry for knowledge. And this is my opportunity to teach them something interesting, to form their opinions, to help them debate, to provoke their thoughts. And they are the future because they are going to, after 10 years or so, they are going to turn around and say, you know, what this government is doing is not right or this is right. And to help them reach that opinion, to help them reach that kind of a knowledge is also a very big contribution that I think economists can do. And I think we should keep doing that because we will need to form that opinion. We will need to bring up that critical mass of people who believe in a certain thing. And I think that's very important, particularly now when there has been an erosion of intellectualism, if I may call it."

        "message": "up too much in Punjab, but this is later. This is for later. So a couple of the questions actually hit directly at this question. Like, you know, Shrena, before you came over lunch, Rajeshwari and I were chatting about how economists often suffer from the curse of knowledge, that they'll know something so well that they'll assume that, oh, everybody knows this, we don't need to say it. And I realized sometimes it's not the case. Most people really want to know, they're curious about what do economists do. And a couple of the questions that came in indicate that. Where Monami at Monami DG on Twitter asks, how has their research contributed to or influence real change in the society? Right? That's one thing. And another question from Murugesh is, in which area, the theory of economics has the highest accuracy or probability of success? That's another thing. And there are different questions, you know, a couple of the lovely sort of sceptical notes that were struck. One is by Varun Das, where he paraphrased George Bernard Shaw. And he said, lay them end to end and see if they reach a conclusion. And another one, you know, Harry Truman had this famous saying, I want a one handed economist, because economists keep saying on one hand this on the other. And a Twitter user called up to a point asked the question, would an octopus make for a good economist? Because it can say on the other hand, seven times. But my entirely serious question there for a layperson is what do economists do? Right? Now, one of the laments of our friend Ajay has been that too many economists who have studied the subject and know the subject, then enter this long academic circle jerk where they take themselves out of the system, and they have no impact at all on the real world. And it is his lament that too many bright people do this, and more people should stay back like him, who actually try to make, who actually try to do things in the real world. Now, where do you find economists? You know, like, in Delhi, I understand there might be places you can throw a stone and hit one. But not that economists should be strong. No, but they might be. They might be strong. Very, very, very soon in multiple ways. But so tell me, what is the ecosystem for economists? Like, where are economists? What are they doing? Do they make a difference"

        "message": "in the real world? So, if I may go first, which is, so there was a time Amit when and I'm talking of let's say in pre 90s, right? When you think of economists or statisticians, they were all in academia, right? You would have this universities and they would be professors, faculty members teaching students and doing research. This was the old traditional world of economists. From there, we went through liberalization, privatization, globalization, etc. And then I think the whole ecosystem of economists where they can go broadened significantly and it's no longer just limited to academic economists going to university teaching students and writing research papers that nobody can understand. A lot of that happens as well. At the same time, for example, you have think tanks and this started with the planning commission being the oldest think tank, so to speak, planning commission and from there on you think of all the think tanks in Delhi, Bangalore, Bombay, Pune, all over the place in India and globally as well. Where these are the economists have chosen not to enter universities, you're not essentially teaching students per se, but you're doing a lot of government work, you're doing a lot of policy work, which is also very valuable. Also, then there are a lot of economists who are in demand in the corporate world. So, all of these big corporate banks, corporate organizations would have chief economists and other economists positions where they need this economist to talk to the foreign clientele, foreign investors, domestic investors as well and that's a good service because you are sort of convincing the investors to bring money into India, you're convincing the domestic investors to invest in a certain financial portfolio and you're sort of helping them understand what the economy, what's the state of the economy like. And that's also I think a very important thing that they're doing. And also, for example, you would have economists in India particularly, where there is this mix of you are an academic economist who are in a university, you're teaching students, etc. But you're also involved in media writing where you want to make economics more accessible to the common man and you're writing in media on a regular basis because you feel strongly about these things, you think that you need to have a voice and the common man and these are newspapers or media outlets that are being accessed by educated people, let's call it that way. And therefore, you are no longer keeping economics restricted to only those who understand the jargon, the math, the numbers, you're trying to make it accessible, which I think is extremely important. And these are also the economists who could equationally engage with think tanks, occasionally engaging with the consulting world, with the corporate world. And then there's sort of the boundaries get blurred, which I find is a fascinating development that has happened in this post liberalization world, which was non-existent earlier. So that economists operating in silos or economists sitting in ivory towers and completely inaccessible to the common man, I think that has definitely changed significantly. And it's something to be quite hopeful about. For example, I look at my coterie of economies that I hang out with, so to speak, almost nobody is an academic economist in university, right? Everybody, either they have their entrepreneurs have started their own think tank, or they are in a corporate world where, you know, talking to investors and writing regularly in columns, they are writing chapters in books, they are talking to multilateral organizations, it's all over the place. So the contribution is no longer that one centric that either you're teaching students and sitting in ivory tower, or you're sitting in a planning commission. It's a much more broad based contribution. And that's why I think that we shouldn't only think of our usefulness from a policymaking perspective. Even if that one thing has gotten suppressed for the time being, there are many, many other things where you could be contributing. And I guess that's what to answer your question."

        "message": "That's what economists do. Maybe I can come in, you know, in fact, this relates to what I was also talking about the general sense of despondency. First, let's start with who is an economist, right? Like, let's just start with that. I completely disagree. I don't have a PhD in economics. I have a job. It's very much a job of a jobbing economist. I work with people at the World Bank, many of them come from very strong, almost jobbing every day dealing with the economy and real terms in very different ways. Some work on infrastructure, some may work on tariff pricing, some work like myself on the welfare state. So let's start with that. I think the biggest issue I take with I think the economist community is while I agree with Rajeshwari that there's a blurring, but I think there's a blurring as long as you have the same sort of status and credentials as each other. You can speak to each other, you can almost scan your CVs and you have a sense of what that means. There are lots of economists and young students who studied economics. I go to Bhubaneswar, I go to like small towns in Chhattisgarh. There are kids who have studied a master's who are interested. Some of them have joined junior government services, right? So they are state carder officers. There are lots of people who are very elegant in the way they think about using economic theory data. They have a great facility for it. They may not have PhDs from the fanciest places or they may not be in fact interacting with the world of status, be it think tanks, corporate, so on and so forth. But they are actively using that body of knowledge in their everyday decision making. I work with some of these young men. Often they are men. That is still the nature of I think that's the other thing. One is who is an economist and economist is often a man. So it's really lovely that actually we're both here. So thanks Amit for that. And I think the first issue we do have to sort of start to think about and I think Amit you and I talked about it during our last episode, which is how do you start to create a community of thinking and practice around the economy that may not necessarily be involved in academic production or production of research material for policymaking or for essentially communicating to a future generation of students because I think that's a very different world. We also talked about last time, Amit, that the point is not to impact policy. The point is to change the way people think. And I think economic theory actually, perhaps sometimes even more than data, has a very strong way of helping you make sense of the world. And I see that. So I think the first thing I want to say is, you know, when you ask what do economists do, I think the first thing we need to ask is who is an economist? And to me an economist is not someone who just has a PhD from a certain set of schools who studied it. People who have that obviously have a very, they play in a different league and I think that's a different world. But there's a whole community out there who I don't think are as vociferous and I wish they were. And I'm looking to that. And what makes me despondent honestly is when you asked what do economists do? So there's the world that Rajeshwari just described, which is actually I do agree is thriving. There's a lot of investment. This is being supported. You start to move away. And in fact, there are think tanks which used to be really well supported now are struggling with FCRA, raising domestic funding, raising foreign funding for research. And I think there's a deep crisis of that. And when I'm talking about these young men, they are again, I hope there'll be more young women in say, you know, a small town or tier two town in a state in India, which is not Maharashtra or Delhi. I think part of the issue is where will the financing, a sustainable model of financing come from where a lot of these young men and women can be exposed to economic models of thinking, which I think are really powerful, and then use them in their day to day lives almost as if, you know, you're solving puzzles, which is actually sometimes what I think is very elegant about the subject. I don't think we're doing that enough. I think what economists tend to do is, Rajeshwari, I think has just summarized that really beautifully. Just from my own example, day to day, what is my job? My job is, in fact, using a lot of that theory to think about how different states in India design their welfare policies. How is the welfare state functioning? In fact, I think one of the core areas where I think economists and economists who don't necessarily, again, subscribe to a certain way we define economists have really impacted the real world is welfare. I think Rajeshwari alluded to this, so many NGOs, so many activists, actually, they come from the world of partial economics training, and I can see how they've used those ideas, a kind of affinity to evidence based decision making in their activism, which has been really powerful. And I think, you know, we owe a lot to that. And I think what we need to think very carefully about as a community is how is it that we can raise support and create a parallel ecosystem, which actually supports this kind of knowledge generation, access to data, and it doesn't ring fence it around just certain norms around what is considered sort of, you know, who is an economist by status, but who is an economist by interest and by activity. And then, you know, you may really be terrible at the subject, like I could never finish a PhD, it's just not, I don't have the talent or the tenacity for it. As I mentioned earlier, I have different kinds of talents. And that actually is a world, Amit, I'm very optimistic about. I think for me, maybe that is where moving away what I will do in the future, I think that is where I'm interested. But if you start to look at what's happening to that world now, it's institutionally heavily constrained in terms of where it will find sources of just straight up market financing to support it. You have, you know, I can tell you there are IES officers or state carder officers working in different states in the country who want to be better trained. They want to study more, they want to learn more. But the Indian Labasna and all the sort of, you know, the institutions that teach theory or practice to these, you know, to officers, they are limited in also what they are able to do and who they will include in their training programs, the capacity, and I think you had guests here who've talked about this before, the capacity of administrative structures to offer this kind of training is also limited. Star economists do not go to, you know, small state carder training academies to sort of train. I think that's starting to change. I'm very excited by some of the things I hear J-PAL is trying to do with their partnerships. I think that's really the space where I think economists, there's a lot of demand for economists to do stuff. And I think there could be buoyancy. But right now, it's heavily constrained. And I think to answer your question, in addition to I think what Rajeshree said and the question the gentleman asked about what do economists do, I also think economists do participate, we can't walk away from the circle jerk. That is a significant chunk of what I think a lot of economists are doing. And I face it and you know, I've seen it, it's interesting, even with the book of the life of the book, I've noticed what that actually means. And I think being a bit more empathetic to the fact that there's a community out there that may not be participating in the circle jerk, but is very interested, and is also in positions of authority and power, and also in their day to day life can use this as theory data and make impactful, meaningful decisions. I think that's really critical to me. So yeah."

        "message": "One thing if I may add Amit is, it may not have come across clearly, but one thing that I was trying to allude to is that there was a time when economics was considered an inaccessible subject. Because it is traditionally very math heavy. It was more science than social science. It was very heavy in statistics. It was considered that only a handful of people who have a certain knowledge or bent of mind and access to a certain kind of training can end up studying economics. And that limited the scope for economics. And that also, I think, gave economics a bad name down the road. Because, you know, there's this notion that if you're an economist, it's a very hard subject, it's a very dry thing, we are dealing with things that we don't even understand. At the same time, economics fundamentally at heart is a social science, right? It derives inspiration from what's happening in the society. And therefore, I think somewhere down the line, we lost that connection that economists need to be able to explain what's happening in the society and also communicate that to the society. So we went into this whole world of almost every scientific theorizing world where you're very good in your theoretical models, and you're doing a whole lot of cranking of equations and math. But ultimately, what does it all mean in terms of intuition in terms of the real life social impact, and very, very few economists would then make the effort of bridging that gap. And I think, primarily in the US, for example, where most of the economic theories come from, a lot of it was because economists there is all university economist, with PhD, as Shaina mentioned, publishing in journals. So that's a whole different ballgame altogether. But what I what I realized is, and I think I've mentioned in the first episode with you is that when I came back to India, I realized the world is much very, very different and, and much better, quote, unquote, compared to what I saw in the US, because here there are economists who make the effort to reach out to the common man or beat. And this has nothing to do with whether you have a PhD in economics, when you don't have a PhD in economics, you have some basic training in economics, you understand the world, and you want to explain the world to the rest of the society. And there are people have made that effort, you're writing in the media, you're, you're doing, you know, even to the extent that everybody listens to TV, even in regional languages, right, you're doing TV interviews, you're trying to explain what the budget means, you're trying to explain what's happening to inflation, what's happening to prices. And that is very, very important. And I think that's a very valuable service that economists and by economists, I mean, anybody who has a basic training in economics to be able to understand things a little bit better than let's say, for example, what the common man on the street would, but they are taking that effort to explain that. And to and that is a world that I think has happened over the last 20, 30 years. And of course, there's a whole long way to go, we are just only scratching the surface. But to the extent that it is happening to the extent that people there is a critical mass of economists are at least aware of this responsibility, and they're doing it, doing that, I think that that's definitely a great thing. And in terms of funding, I think, this is a constraint across all subjects, like even hard sciences, which traditionally would get more funding. Everybody's struggling to get funding over the last few years, because there is this whole, like constraint on intellectual pursuit or constraint on scientific pursuit, in terms of giving funding to universities and institutions."

I see this across the board. In fact, some of the most useful economic data is coming out of NGOs that, you know, you take Ajivika Bureau, looking at migrants, you look at a lot of the work that's coming out of different organizations, who are not even based in Delhi or Bombay, they're not interested in that game. They are all being squeezed. It's a very difficult time. And I think, while yes, sure, it's difficult for universities and institutions, but universities and institutions will always fight. There'll be corporates, there'll be, you know, patrons, there'll be alumni. When I look at these organizations, which are almost trying to create their own models of economic investigation, actually, a lot of theory is ground up theory, right? It can come from here. I think they can come up with a very different way of thinking about how we theorize migration movements and labor leisure trade-offs, for example, but who will finance that work? Because what I see, and you know, maybe this comes from the fact that my first job ever was at a heavily underfunded feminist think tank, where I saw my boss constantly struggling, this remarkable woman constantly struggling to just organize funds. And invariably, if you link yourself to donor financing, which is invariably what happens with think tanks, livelihoods organizations, donors are interested and I don't blame them. I understand they're interested in certain outcomes, right? Which always have to do with, give me a survey, give me some data points. But maybe there's theory that can be built off that. There are lessons to be crystallized. And I just don't see right now, and I see organizations really struggling to find core institutional funding to be able to do that. And I think in that world, you will still have the dominant modes of knowledge production, particularly in the social sciences and economics is particularly politically very important because it is the economy, right? I mean, it kind of holds a set of interactions, which hold tremendous power. And I think I see that. So I share, I think what Rajeshwari says that, well, things have changed and that, you know, it's a much more democratic space. Sure. I think there's a lot more than we can do. I often joke now that I don't want to Brahmin explain the economy to anyone. I actually now just want to hear where different theories come from. And I think there are things happening in universities we may not even know about, right? Or organizations we may not know of. But what often I wonder about is where will that almost the venture capital for that come from? And in fact, this is where I think that the Indian private sector can come into play a really important role because we know these organizations are going to struggle to find foreign financing. So yeah, I think we have to think about just these very alternative models of supporting these ecosystems. And that I think I'm very excited about because I do think that there is a quorum of now young people, particularly in the private sector, who I think are thinking about some of these things, especially given where we are right now as a country."

And unfortunately, because I do macroeconomics, it is one of the unfundable fields, right? Nobody is interested. Nobody's interested in understanding GDP growth rate, but nobody's interested in funding any effort to actually understand the data collection process, right? Everybody's interested in inflation because it affects the common man, but nobody, none of the donors is interested in anything to do with funding monetary policy research. Everybody's interested in government debt taxation. Nobody's interested in funding research to do with the fiscal policies of the government. So I unfortunately work in a field where there is no scope to get funding from anybody, right? Be it the big global multilateral organizations, be it the private sector, be it anybody, right? And I woke up to this reality and I realized that while I am at an institute where there is some funding coming from X, Y, Z, but there is also a push to become more independent in terms of funding. So let's say, for example, if I want to start my own center in macroeconomics research, I will never be able to get funding from anybody despite the fact that I want to start the center in the university. And the university itself doesn't want to do the funding. That's the whole idea of starting an autonomous center, but I won't get funding. But then what do I have to do? If I want to get funding, I'll have to change my areas of interest. I have to change my specialization. So for example, if I start working on climate change, if I start working even on any topic related to development economics, if I start working on renewable energy, right? These are the fundable fields where at least there is some scope of getting funding, consumer protection in finance. These are the silos where you can at least get some funding. So then you start to think that, okay, if I want to stay true to what I understand, what I have a limited training and I'm passionate about that, then how do I get my own independent funding if I want to hire five RAs who are equally interested in these subjects and I want to pay their salaries, where will I get the money from? But then does that mean I have to now start researching in climate change, renewables, health, wherever the donors and the funders think that they are going to get high returns from, right? So that becomes the distortion in social sciences like economics where either you change your field to suit the donor and the funder or you languish in this low-level equilibrium where your salary is just being given by the university, but that may not be enough because a lot of constraints imposed on you by the institute and you may not be having the independence to start a center of your own where you can hire RAs, etc. So it's a very, very difficult world to negotiate. There is no doubt about that."

And one is one of my constant rants on the show is this impression people have that economics has nothing to do with the real world. Who cares about these numbers and what is GDP anyway and this and that. And by the way, there were many questions on the GDP for us on Twitter and I just want to tell all of them that listen, you have an episode length answer on that because Rajeshwari and I did a long episode on GDP, which goes into all of these issues. Why is women's unpaid labor not counted? And so many conceptual problems with the GDP, practical problems with the GDP and so on and so forth. But my point always has been that numbers are people too. That, you know, economics matters because it shines a lens on real things going wrong in the real world to real people. A good economist will always make that distinction clear. Like one of the reasons I loved your book Shrayana so much was that's exactly what you did, right? You used the tools of economics, the frames of economics of thinking about problems to get to, in a sense, the core of the human condition, that this is what people are like. This is why a man and a woman in the same house can't speak, which is a great human tragedy. But this is why it is and you're using those tools to illuminate that, you know. And to me, that's the best of economics in the sense that it's okay. I see this entire class of economists who go to college, get their PhDs, get all of that. They'll be hyper specialized in sea trade between Peru and Bolivia between 1830 to 1844, right? I know who you're talking about. No, I'm not actually talking about anyone in particular. I never, I never, I never, I don't. It is my job to introduce the gossip into the, we'll come to that. We'll come to that. But on the other hand, the thing about economics and why I am so much in love with it, and of course, I don't have a PhD in it either. But one reason I love economics is I feel economics fundamentally is a study of human behavior, right? So if you're interested in human behavior, the economic lens can just teach you so much like earlier Rajeshwari you and I were at lunch and I asked a companion to ask me any question about anything and I'll give an answer using economics and it's a one word answer. And you know, and you can because the economic way of thinking just illuminates the whole world. Now taking that forward, when I think of, you know, the person who asked the question that what have you actually achieved? Now there are three ways of defining achieved, right? One is a top down thing where a government does something. Are you influencing policy at this point in time for the last few years? I don't think any serious economist has influenced policy in any way. Obviously, it's just quacks and crackpots and useful idiots. Yeah, and that's one way. But the point is, if you really want to bring about change, I've always said, don't look at the supply end of the political marketplace, look at the demand and get your ideas out there among the people, you know, in clear language, use those tools of economics, share those tools of economics so others can also apply them to their own lives in the world around you. And there I think within civil society, there are two ways this can happen. One is civil society organizations which do their own work in their own research, like, you know, Shrayana, you pointed out you went to Bhuvaneshwar, there are all these enthusiastic mostly men who are, you know, doing all of what they're doing. But the other is just this greater awareness among citizens of what is going wrong. And I think understanding economics, understanding incentives, understanding scarcity, all of that has a big role to play in that. And therefore, my question on funding is this, and I think it might have come up in a different form in our episode also, Shrayana, is that in everything else, I find that things like funding and support are in a sense, decentralized, and no longer so dependent on authorities or mainstream platforms. So if I want to write a book, for example, sure, there might be themes which are popular in the publishing world, which are chasing a formula and chasing a trend. But I can write what the hell I want. And in the creator economy, you are no longer dependent on gatekeepers. And you can, in fact, even crowdsource whatever funding you might need for your work. And increasingly, you see this in more and more ways, even if you don't call it crowdsourcing, everyone who's successful in the creator economy, you know, whatever they earn through what they do, they can put it into what they do next, as indeed I do. So is there then a possibility of, you know, economics escaping the circle jerk and escaping this whole game of having to influence policy to be influential? Because I think the greatest impact that economics can really have is that people see the world differently. Today, people look around them and you know, the sort of economic illiteracy and the how that affects the way they look at the world, it just makes me very pessimistic. But I think that's where we kind of need to work harder. So just some rambling thoughts."

        "message": "What do you guys think? Again, it's not rambling, but I may be wrong in this. But I think what happens is that at the end of the day, let's say you want to earn your livelihood as an economist, right? You want to earn a living. Somebody has to pay you money, right? Unless you have enough money that you can just sit on it and do freelance economist. I mean, that also many people do and that's fine. But that's a very, very small percentage. So let's not go there. So if you want to earn your living as an economist, somebody has to pay you. And the question is, who's that somebody going to be? Is it very safe, a university, a corporate, a think tank, an NGO, a decentralized local level organization? There has to be somebody who pays you the money and whoever is paying you the money, it's not free lunch. That entity wants you to do some things in a certain way, right? While we say that as academics or as economists or as intellectuals, we have certain freedom, that freedom is also not unchecked, unrestricted, right? Now, this gets significantly worse when you're talking about funding agencies. Because when it comes to funding agencies, let's say I want to break free from the university system, right? I want to break free from institutions, I want to break free from think tanks, everything. And I just want to, as I said, set up my own center where I can do whatever I want, talk to the common man, explain economics in the common language, everything that I want to do. Who's going to pay me the money to do that? The funding agencies are not interested in that. Unless you are doing this in the field that they think will have policy implications, right? And therein comes the whole policy circle. That unless the government or the powers that we are interested in this field, the funding agencies have no incentive to fund that particular field, which means you're back to square one. Then you suddenly don't have the freedom to talk about X, Y, Z in economics that you actually are passionate about. But then you have to cater to what the funding agencies want you to do and what the policymakers want you to work on. So I think therein lies the conundrum that we haven't reached the level of sophistication of, I don't want to use the word GDP growth, but we haven't reached the sophistication of a certain level of income of the country where there is funding for any kind of discipline that a person wants to study and research in. And therefore, because there is a pyramidal impact, there is sort of like precious resources being allocated across a large number of disciplines, economics sort of is on the back burner. It's compared to, let's say, the hard sciences, compared to science and engineering research, which attracts a lot more funding. Economics as a social system and other social sciences are worse off, but we are still better off on that front. But even there, we sort of fall on the back burner. And then all of this jostling comes about that what is the field that you're interested in? But no, sorry, there is no funding in that. So therefore, you can't do anything in it. So it's not easy to break free from that and yet sustain a livelihood."

        "message": "I've been thinking about this actually a lot of late. And I think there are a couple of things that I feel, which are actually in the realm of, again, what the McKinsey consultants would like, low-hanging fruit. I think the first is, we have to think of more market clearing mechanisms of matching demand for certain research grants with those who have the resources to do it domestically. Because right now, I think we are living in a fool's paradise if we think this whole situation with the FCRA is going to. It's just too complicated. I also don't understand it enough, to be perfectly honest. It's just very messy. But I think there are enough deep pockets domestically. It's just that they're financing a lot of other kinds of work. A lot of money is going into invisible electoral bonds. It might be nice if some of that is, you know. So I think some of it, I'm looking, honestly, to the private sector. And I think I'm looking to technology platforms, VCs to say, can we think about a way a certain proportion of the CSR funding is pooled and you create some kind of a matching platform. There is no reason, Amit, which you described about the creator economy cannot be true for a lot of, and in fact, a lot of these research projects, you know what Rajeshwari described, it's not expensive. It's not like you're asking for core institutional grants sometimes. It might just be a small piece of work and there ought to be ways to just match. So I think this is an open challenge to anyone listening to us or anyone in the private sector who can create an aggregator platform. Let's try and think about creating something that does matching, right? That's one. I think the second is, there have to be, I think, some rules and norms in place to say that some part of the ICSSR, if I've got the acronym right, and each time nowadays I mention this acronym, my friends in Delhi at least all look very like the shoulders start to slump. I think there has to be some mechanism where, you know, yes, of course, one is despondent about reforms, but institutions do change and institutions have to be updated. We have to think very carefully about some of these social science research institutions. What can be changed? And we do currently have a government, you know, for good or for bad, is very big on administrative reform. There's a lot actually that can be done, which will tow any party line, which will make anyone look good. So I think we need to attack the fundamental problem, which is the way the government organises is also being a principal funder of a lot of this research. Either we say, well, part of the government should just get out of it. That's also a possibility. Or we start to think very carefully about how do we, in the current contemporary world that we live in, organise these institutions. So that's the second. And I don't think that that again is so difficult, it's possible to do. I think the third has to be, we need to think about, and this I know gets a little controversial, because this is where you start introducing distortions. But I really do think we need to think about financing ecosystems in smaller cities. There has to be some, I'm almost thinking like affirmative action for towns, where we say that funding has to go to core universities in places which are really, because if you look, I can actually show you a map right now. And I'm sure this is not going to surprise Rajeshwari or you Amit. But funding is very geographically concentrated. Everything is going. And by the way, it's not because researchers are often there now. In fact, many researchers are in all parts of the country. But it's because the accounting ability, the capacity to process the money, to do the procurement, all of that is actually sitting in the big cities, which is where money goes there. If you start to put in rules, which almost create this distortion and artificial allocation, maybe then we start to build, there were these good governance centers coming out, for example, from Madhya Pradesh, I'll give you that one example. Those organizations, they've done so much for the Lokseva Kendras and the right to time bound services in the state of Madhya Pradesh. This is also true for smaller towns in Karnataka, because they were doing governance research, but it was financed, some financing from government, along with organizations coming in to support. And it worked really well because now if you go to Madhya Pradesh, there is, I mean, for good or for bad, there is a thriving community of people who can explain the governance structures down to the bone to anyone who wants to understand, which is useful for politicians, is useful for what you were saying, citizens, knowing more about how government is organized, right? We need to put in these, there has to be some rules and norms such that the geographical concentration of the funding pipelines have to just radically change. It'll make people like me very unhappy because, you know, people like me want funding for projects that I want to do based out of Delhi, but I think it's time that people like me were a bit more frustrated and others received, I think, more of the allocations. I think that's the third. Last thing, actually, I said three things, but actually I have a fourth thing, which is, I really have been wondering a lot about if we were to measure our MPs or our MLAs on the measure of economic decision making. I mean, it's a very, again, this is something I've just been thinking about. It's very abstract. How do you start to crystallize that? It can't be growth because it's not something that they control and Rajeshwari will get angry at me if I even try and suggest that, but they have to be, is it roads? Maybe not because that's done by the central ministry. Can we think about incubating a research group within, you know, one of our larger, more prestigious think tanks? And again, this is an open challenge to anyone listening who thinks very carefully about how do we almost create this kind of evidence-based citizen-centric conversation around how well is my MLA doing when it comes to managing the local economy? How much does the MLA even control of the local economy? How much, you know, what can the MP do? Have they made speeches in parliament on, you know, the way certain economic decisions are being made? How have they supported the GST rationalization process as the government is trying to figure out how to implement it better? There have to be methods through which we can hold political officials much more accountable on the economy. I think what's happened is there was a method to try and do these citizen report cards. It's happened. Often they're very simple service delivery measures. Often we, you know, ADR has done a lot on corruption, right? Saying how many people have cases against them. But can we think very hard about supporting, and again, perhaps this will require, you know, large trusts and donor organizations or, you know, the private sector to support a very thought through conversation on measuring, firstly, the performance of a political office when it comes to at least the local rules of the economy that they do manage, because it's not like they can completely wash their hands of it. There are things that do sit in their control. And how do we sort of foster that conversation? I think, Amit, this goes back to what you were saying as well, which is that, you know, we see, for example, with the app, right? It was that conversation around corruption and holding MLAs and local officials politically accountable for corruption that fostered an entire social and political movement. Why don't we have that for lemon prices? You know, right now we're all discussing inflation. Can we think about breaking it down in simple ways, so that the ordinary public who is consuming this information can understand it, hold their local officials more accountable? Anyway, so this is just a list of four things."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean, a couple of, you know, with this last point, and I'll go back to the earlier ones, but a couple of issues that I see coming up here is, number one, our MPs can actually do nothing, they're powerless, partly because of the anti-defection law. I've had episodes on that with Varun Mitra and M. R. Madhavan, I'll link them from the show notes. But you can run parliament from an Excel sheet, MPs are not allowed to go against the party line. What the PMO decides is effectively what every BJP MP and MLA in this country is bound to. So what do you hold them accountable for when you don't have the power? The second issue is I'd done an episode with our mutual friend long ago, Shruti Rajgopalan, who has recorded with both of you in different ways. And also as a question for you guys, I'll bring up later, but which was about urban governance. And her point was that at the local level, there is a disconnect between power and accountability. That, for example, the person who's, you know, standing to be an MLA in Maharashtra or in Bombay, or who, you know, their vote base is different. Nobody is looking at an urban vote bank in Maharashtra, they're looking at all the different rural vote banks and all of that. Now, you might be worried about, you know, why is the garbage not being picked up from outside, but the person you can vote for does not control that. And the person who does control that is outside your control. So there is that disconnect between power and accountability, which is also a question"

        "message": "which greater local self-governance would of course help. But you know, Amit, on that, and there is actually work in economics and in political science coming out of the US, Latin America that shows when you start to even create noise about holding local officials accountable, it also then fosters inner party friction. Because right now what you have is one word goes because there's also not, you know, there's no incentive for an MLA or an MP now to fight that or fight against that sort of party line, because they are not necessarily being fully impacted or held to account for it. And I think I see and I, my sense is if we actually, and this is, I think this is why it's an open research question, to what extent can we hold political officials accountable? Or is it just that there is only everyone in the Ministry of Finance and the RBI who can be held accountable for what's happening in the economy? I don't think that that's true. I think there is actually different levels and levers of control that are available. And either you're just not exercising them, in which case then people need to know. And there has to be a more well thought out method to do that. Because right now we just don't have that conversation. I mean, in the US you have conversations around lobby groups, right? And we see that a lot. We just don't see that very clearly in our country. But who is, you know, where are we holding our political officials accountable on questions around the economy, if it isn't them profiteering off the economy in corruption? I mean, in a different way. And that's something I hope someone takes up. And I'm not completely sort of, you know, throwing that out just because MLAs and MPs don't have control over all decisions. I think there's a way you can"

        "message": "do it. Sorry, go ahead. So I think accountability has become a pervasive problem now, right? I mean, I see instances, for example, I was shocked that you do something like demonetization, and you get away with it, right? And you win a large state election right after demonetization. To me, that was a shock. I mean, there was not a single protest all over the country, and it was a nationwide shock. And there was no protest. I mean, other than some small sporadic protests in Bengal, but in Bengal, there's a culture of protesting everything. But other than that, there was no protest anywhere in the country. And then you saw the election results. Then you have the second wave of the COVID pandemic. And we all lived through the horrors of it. And then you see the election results. And you think and wonder, what's the connect between holding the state, the government at any level, for what happened and who I'm going to vote for? So this, to me, has become almost a puzzle that how do you enforce accountability at any level of governance when it's become very easy for the government to win elections through bread and circus by providing rations and cheap internet, where everybody's going to vote on the basis of short term gains at the cost of long term pains. And therefore, where is the accountability for larger things like any of the economic issues you talk about? You talk about health care, you talk about education, you talk about corruption, you talk about infrastructure, things that we like to talk about. But when you go to the common man, what is he or she voting on? She's voting on do I have a cooking gas connection? Do I have water? Do I have electricity? Do I have a house? These are also important. But what it has boiled down to is that the government is using its limited resources to provide basic goods and services, as opposed to providing public goods and services, so to speak. And therefore, that accountability mechanism, I am happy because I can access clean water, clean cooking gas and a house, which for large spools of Indian population, that's very important. So am I going to hold the government accountable for rendering 86% of the cash invalid overnight? My life is miserable as it is, it's a little bit marginally miserable, but at least I have access to clean gas and clean water, etc. So I think, what is the connect of the citizen with the government? Does the average citizen even interact with the government on a regular basis? And I don't think they do. So therefore, in the minds of the citizenry, government is somebody who's providing maybe the basic goods and services, I'm happy with it. And therefore, come elections, for whatever compulsions, I'm going to vote for such and such local party member. Beyond that, they're not holding the government accountable for any of the things that we think are important. So I think there is a disconnect between that interaction between government on a day to day basis and a citizen's daily life. And it's very easy for a government to sort of win over that interaction by providing these basic goods, which is exactly what has gotten entrenched in Indian polity over the last several decades. So who do you hold accountable for what? I mean, how do you hold RBI accountable for what it's doing? How do you hold Ministry of Finance? I'm not even going at the decentralised level. At the centralised level, there's no accountability. At the decentralised level, there's no accountability. I mean, think of the Bengal elections. I know Bengal because I'm from Bengal. How do you win elections? You float a lot of schemes which are women-centric. Women come out in hordes to cast votes. That's a remarkable thing. Great. But why are the women voting? Because most of the schemes are directed towards women. Is there any emphasis on job creation? Is there any emphasis on actually building infrastructure assets or anything that's going to promote long term sustainable job creation and growth? No. So it's become increasingly easy for political parties to win elections, which is what they most care about. And in that kind of a system where you can just win elections by providing freebies and basic goods, how do you hold"

I'm kidding. But I disagree with, they're not freebies because we do live in a world, particularly coming out of the pandemic, where most of the country is between the poverty line and twice the poverty line. I mean, this is a, we are, it's a really dire situation. Extreme poverty has reduced in India, continues to reduce, but precarity has just increased incredible levels. We know from RCTs across the globe and also work that's happening in India that you need some assurance and these transfers are very important. I think what needs to happen and I know maybe we'll come to this later. I think one of the core reforms that certainly something in my work I'm really pushing is India needs to have a social protection policy. What other countries would call a social protection policy. I think it links to what Rajeshwari is saying, which is you need to have a fiscal path on which these kinds of entitlements and programs operate. So if you look at, you know, Brazil or Mexico and many of these countries, you essentially have a very clear policy path, which says certain X share on spending, there are limits and rules, there are rules of the game. I think what's happened here is you have 20 pension schemes, they're targeting the same person and often the person who's supposed to get it doesn't get it, right? There are all these issues. I think there has to be a way and first you need to bind different groups of government into a policy framework. Right now, we don't think about it like that. I think some states are thinking about it like that. And I am hoping, you know, in the future that this is something that the national government at least will have to think about because it's also fiscally unsustainable beyond a path. Having said that, I think I agree with everything Rajeshwari just said. But what I will say is, I mean, jobs, for example, it's just fascinating to me, jobs and inflation, actually. And I'm curious to hear what Rajeshwari and you Amit have to say. I don't know, coming out of the UP election, I think all of us had this moment of tremendous, I don't know, I don't even call it pause. I think it was just somewhat, because is it the case that jobs just don't matter anymore? I was seeing some really interesting journalists reporting out of UP essentially saying, similar to what I think Rajeshwari is saying, which is that as long as you have a core set of entitlements, but it's interesting because I also know the data and UP to know that the people who actually are targeted for, I mean, who should be receiving priority for those entitlements don't get the full basket. Is it that jobs just don't politically matter? I think that's an open question and honestly, it's something that I don't have an answer to. I know that women's jobs don't matter at all. I don't think anyone cares. I think we are very happy with equilibrium in the employment landscape when it comes to women. But I'm wondering whether jobs just have stopped mattering as a political issue. I mean, did they matter in the history of our country's economy? I wonder, I mean, this is a question for us to think about. And the same for inflation. I mean, look at what's happening right now. Now, in fact, I do see, of course, the opposition has picked up on it. But I wonder that, and I don't know if it's just, honestly, Rajeshwari, I don't know whether it's just that you've been sedated as an electorate through welfare, because actually not everyone is receiving the welfare transfers. I mean, it's not also, we saw what happened with migrants going back during the crisis. The One Nation One Ration card is yet to fully take off. It's not the case that everybody's receiving the entitlements. In fact, you have activists arguing for deeper entitlements because there are concerns about some people just being completely left out. So I wonder what's going on. I mean, what are you, I mean, if jobs and inflation are not political issues anymore, which all of us in our one training were told that, well, they are, they should be. I wonder what is the labour market now? Is the labour market basically getting paid to, I don't know, harass people online? I mean, are those the jobs that we are going to create? I wonder, is that now what the job market is? It's an open"

        "message": "question to both of you. So I have several points to make, Amit, if I can. So one is that I do agree that the pandemic was obviously, it's an outlier rare event, right? And when a rare event like this hits a country, you need to do redistribution because the situation is absolutely dire. But I think there is a case to be made that redistribution should focus more on rare events rather than become a norm. And I think what we have internalised is we have a redistributive model of development. And that is what we have internalised over the decades. And that is what gets used in election cycle to basically win the elections. And that's where the accountability breaks down, right? So basically, I guess what I'm trying to say is that if the common voter is happy with the basic goods that are being provided, irrespective of a pandemic, then what is the incentive of that common voter to say that, no, I'm going to hold you accountable for all these other problems that's happening in my locality, right? I think that incentive structure is very weak. And that is something that has somehow smoothly happened. If there's one thing that has smoothly happened in India over the decades, it is this idea that you can give the common man these basic goods and services and he or she is okay with it because you're starting from such a low level, but you provide that and they need that basic standard of life and the government is providing that. And then they no longer feel the necessity to hold the government accountable for all the things that we think are important in the long run, right? And the second thing is, I think jobs were never really that important when it came to winning elections, right? Because India traditionally has had a very high unemployment rate or a very low employment rate, because I don't particularly trust the official unemployment numbers. But if I just look at CMI's, Labour Force Participation Rate, right, we've always had a very miserable statistic as far as jobs is concerned. So any incremental improvement on that almost feels like something great has happened. And I completely agree that women's abysmally low LFPR just does not matter to anybody. That's not even an electoral agenda. But basically, the fact that jobs have never really been a decision making point when it comes to winning elections says a lot about what is it that the people of India really care about, right? And that's where I think, if you're getting the welfare entitlements, and you're okay, and you're not holding the government responsible for not having jobs. So I think the accountability is not directly being lined with the government not providing jobs. But I think what does matter is inflation. In fact, 2014 election was lost on two counts, I think one was corruption, and one was inflation, because prices were exorbitantly high. And inflation is like the tax on the poor people, right? And it's the worst tax on the poor people. So when you have uncontrollable inflation that you're just not able to manage, I think that definitely becomes a very deep political problem. And that's what I would be very curious to see what happens in 2024. Because we definitely have lost control on inflation, the way things are looking like. So I think jobs is something that the voter perhaps does not worry about as much when it comes to voting, but inflation definitely something and corruption. I think one of the reasons the government got away with demonetization was that the selling point was this is an anti-corruption measure. And they feel so the average person feels so strongly about corruption, that it was easy to even get away with something like demonetization. But I think inflation will be much harder to get away with and something has to be done soon. But yeah, I constantly worry about accountability. I mean, in a democracy, our only weapon of holding the government accountable is elections. And if that's where this whole connect has broken down, how do you hold anybody accountable?"

And often good economic narratives are much harder to sell. For example, I think we'd all agree that you should allow every eye in retail, because it's good for people at large, and so on and so forth. I mean, hardly needs to be stated. But it's very easy for a politician to oppose it by saying what about the small traders, what will happen to their livelihoods, you know, look at the scene effects and not the unseen effects around the line, so on and so forth.

Because while we have a bankruptcy procedure, when non financial firms go bankrupt, and how do you just resolve them, there is absolutely nothing for financial firms, for banks, etc. Of course, it's a different matter in India, banks never fail. But that's that doesn't mean that they are healthy. I mean, it's just like a, you know, facade that that we are all very comfortable with. But then how do you deal with failed financial firms, and there was a bill that was almost tabled, and a lot of people we know, they worked on the bill, but then the FRDI bill got completely shelved, because the narrative got spun in a very different way that the common man is going to lose bank deposits, the common man is going to get the raw deal, because there is no insurance against deposits, and what's going to happen. And immediately, the whole political narrative changed, and you lost the popular support, and the bill got shelved. But I guess that therein lies the importance of the powers that be to realize what is important for the economy in the long run, or for the country for the long run as a strategy, as opposed to just selling something"

Chhattisgarh was one of the first states after Tamil Nadu to say, well, we'll universalize the food ration program, right? And you did have that particular Mr. Raman Singh's government, they came back to power a few times, but eventually they lost as well. And it's not for the welfare transfers were working well. There are many states, in fact, where they've universalized the welfare programs, a core set, and yet you've had churn. And so clearly there is, you know, I want us to sort of think a bit more critically, because I think it's become now, I hear this amongst a lot of economists, which is well, you know, it's sort of, it's just welfare for votes or handouts, right? It's just another word I don't like. I think there's something deeper going on. I think what's happening is, it's also in relation to what's happening to other markets, because if you have a job market, that's always been precarious. I think part of the reason why jobs have never really been a political agenda, and this is going back to, you know, you have a largely informal economy, jobs are extremely ad hoc, they are human arrangements, right? What are jobs? I mean, it's a set of relationships. And in that world where there's always flux, I'm not surprised that people think that, well, you know, politicians can necessarily not intervene. However, what did happen was there was NREGA. And when NREGA did happen, it has completely, I mean, there are studies that show really rigorous work that shows it has radically transformed the, you know, the reservation wage for someone involved in the rural economy. And that's really important intervention. Now, I don't see again in politics, people necessarily, perhaps after a certain point, holding any politician accountable for how well NREGA is functioning in a particular state. And in some states NREGA ought to function because agrarian job markets and labor markets are really breaking down. And you would think in that context, and especially in inflationary context as well, NREGA is self-selection, you're supposed to demand that work. And it is a job market intervention. I mean, it's not just a welfare scheme, it's actually trying to attack the labor market. And yet I don't see, it's not necessarily yet as politicized a scheme as at a point of time it used to be, right? And I wonder, and I don't have an answer for this. I mean, these are just questions I have, I wonder what's going on. Maybe I think if I may just interrupt, maybe"

And maybe that's why we don't see NREGA come repeatedly and showcased as, because it is a successful strategy. And in fact, it was a savior during the pandemic.

        "message": "at this point of time. Yeah, but I think Rajeshwari, actually, I do have to say, I think when it comes to welfare, there's tremendous continuity across political lines. In fact, that's one thing that's very interesting about the Indian polity. And I know that that bothers some who think about it as sort of, well, again, you know, as you were saying, like this sort of distorts clear accountability mechanisms, distorts other markets as well, right? But what's interesting to me, for example, is NREGA actually for the previous budgets, the allocations actually increased under a different political dispensation. In fact, this government has used the National Food Security Act to even open up further. So I almost see this deepening. I think what's happening, though, is that while the welfare story is sort of, you know, moving along a certain path, I think the question really is, we now have a welfare system, which is very broad, in that there are lots of schemes. Currently, there are around 464 national programs. States have their own, a state like Kerala even has programs at the panchayat level. And yet the depth is very limited. So the actual amount that people are receiving is very small. And I suspect actually, the reason why you almost have this rewarding of schemes is precisely because you don't have one large lump sum transfer. My sense is that if we actually thought very cohesively in a way about welfare, it would actually be beneficial for politicians as well, because you could say, well, this is a national transfer. Maybe the state government does a top up NREGA and PDS function. And then let's think about consolidating all these other legacy programs. But I just don't, again, and this is something that is good politics, it would be good economics. But I just don't see again, the energy to sort of move in that direction. Perhaps we'll see it. There is an election coming up soon. Maybe we'll see it. But I think to just go back to, I agree with what you said, Rajeshwari, but I also wonder, you know, I think the reason why welfare keeps coming up to be this important electoral almost issue is because actually, the benefits are so small, and you're not even guaranteed if you work on NREGA. We know studies show you don't even know when you will get your wages. There are wage backlogs for a very long period of time. And so I think, you know, there is this, so it's almost transactional because the actual depth of the benefits and what people are receiving is so unsure and insecure. So I think, Amit, going back to the question, I think the idea of holding a local politician accountable for good economic choices, it's not just sort of, you know, what can you do on broad budget, broad bills and budget bills, and so on and so forth. I think it's also the local economy, because there are roles. And again, this is a research question. What are the roles and levers that a local politician has to impact the local labour market? I'm thinking of NREGA as one of them, because they do exert tremendous influence on the way panchayats are able to administer or push them to administer certain programs. I wonder if there are others as well. I suspect PM Kisan is one of them, just as an example. It's the quasi basic income for certain groups of farmers. And I think that's where I think we should think a bit more carefully. But how do we start to at least generate more evidence, which I realised then goes back to that circle of when we need to raise resources for that kind of work. But I think that's, I feel like that's really where maybe we're not talking about what economists are doing, but what economists now ought to be thinking about and doing. So let's see."

And I really like that model where you identify the people you trust, who you feel will do interesting work, and then you don't ask any more questions after that. You trust those people to do whatever it is they do that works. I think that deeper kinds of crowdsourcing can also work over time, it just doesn't have to be either the government or institutions or even, you know, private companies deciding to do this, I think it can also come from a different place. And as far as people, you know, not voting with where the interest should lie, I would say a lot of that is also apathy.

I think that's everyone's attitude, man, because nobody expects anything from any government after 70 something years of misgovernance, basically. Now, I want to focus on a different question and go on a rant that might seem unrelated, but in a sense is unrelated. A couple of people on Twitter, you know, where we solicited questions, spoke about inequality, right? And, you know, I had written a column, which I linked from the show notes pointing out that, listen, inequality is a Western obsession. You know, it's a luxury of the elites, we need to focus on poverty, poverty and inequality are completely different things. And the reason people conflate the two is really zero-sum thinking, which is something pervasive that economists have to fight all the time, that, you know, if somebody is getting poorer, somebody must be getting richer, and therefore inequality and poverty, they go together. Now, that's not the case. Inequality and poverty often go in opposite directions. Like one thought experiment question I like to ask people is, in which of these two countries would you rather be poor, Bangladesh or the USA? And obviously, you'd rather be poor in the USA and the USA has far more inequality than Bangladesh does. In fact, countries like USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom have greater inequality than Bangladesh, Liberia, Pakistan and Sierra Leone. But these last four countries I name have greater poverty, right? Now, what has happened after liberalization is we've lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty as inequality has increased. This is counterintuitive, because you would imagine that, you know, poverty and inequality go hand in hand. Now, I find that when many people when they talk about inequality, they actually mean poverty, they're thinking of the plight of poor people. But that's a different thing. And I think language kind of matters. Inequality per se, need not necessarily be a problem. I think it's a big problem in another domain, which I'll ask you about Rajeshwari later, because you're a macro economist, and therefore the perfect person for that. Now, and you know, another illustration of why inequality is not a big deal poverty is, is throughout history, people have moved from towns to cities, villages to towns, they are moving to towards a place of greater inequality, because what matters is escaping poverty. And the reason I say this is that the solutions for both are often opposite, right? And I think that there is a trade off between redistribution and growth. I think what you really need to do is and I agree with you that in a desperately poor country, where some 8000 children die every day of starvation, you need certain kinds of welfare policies to alleviate that and NREGA is a great thing. However, I would like to live in an India where NREGA is not necessary, where you know, the rising tide has lifted all boats where we have greater economic growth. So I just want to kind of conceptually be sort of clear about this like I go by like Harry Frankfurt wrote a book called on inequality where he came up with this concept I love, which is a doctrine of sufficiency. And that guides my thinking that my thinking is guided by does every person have enough to live a life of sufficiency, which you can define any way you want, right? And I won't have a problem with whatever definition you come up with. But the idea is let's take everybody there, let's get out of poverty. And therefore, I find that there is this sort of, you know, when we conflate these two, and when you know, when we use inequality, when we mean poverty, and when we come up with policies that might help inequality by making everybody equally poor, you know, that becomes an issue. So when we talk of welfare and redistribution, I get it at one level, but I also feel disturbed at another level. Because the point is, for example, has become the regal now for all politicians in every election to say to the people farm loan waivers. Now, farm loan waivers to me might be a necessary anesthetic at a moment in time. But you are shifting the focus from the larger greater structural problems you need to"

        "message": "resolve. I don't even think that a farm waiver is welfare policy. Because if you mean there are countries, Amit, where they have taught very well about what their welfare state's architecture ought to be like. China is one of them. Brazil is one of them. We can learn a lot from these countries. They have very different instruments, they use co-financed models of welfare. So there's social insurance as one example, in combination with certain things, which are universal transfers. We just, and I think this goes back to that point that I had made, I mean, if there's one sort of dream reform in my mind, it is a very clear articulation fiscally, as well as between center state relations on what is the welfare architecture of India. Are you going to continue to have 464 schemes? Or do you want to learn from an Indonesia and maybe say, well, we'll have 10 big national schemes, NREGA and PDS, one of them. PMJ is one of them, PM Kisan is one, I'm just throwing that out. And maybe the rest we do as untied grants to states and let states then decide. And then that sort of harmoniously manages some of the center state politics as well. There are ways to do this. Again, one looks at the energy and enthusiasm. So to me, Amit, I think what I think we should retire is this idea that there is this conflict between welfare redistribution and certain growth dividends when it comes to more productive assets and public goods provision. Actually, there are studies coming out of, be it sub-Saharan Africa, be it Latin America, which show that if you do both carefully and together, they work very well. They're mutually reinforcing because if you give people a basic level of cash, for example, there is psychological assurance that you can take on risks in your businesses. You can take on risks in the jobs that you'll do. You can invest in education. They're both mutually reinforcing paradigms. But the question is, you need a policy articulation on what the balance between the two is. I think it's the Finance Commission, actually, where this needs to be articulated. They've done it quite well when it comes to disaster response funds. There's a very clear articulation of how that will be done. It worked quite well during the pandemic because state disaster response funds were being used to actually respond to local crises, because local crises are going to be very different. The national government can't manage it. We need to think very carefully similarly around the welfare question. So I don't disagree with, I think, in fact, what your concern is. I share that concern. But to me, I think what I think we should not think of is that the two are in conflict. I think there has to be a very clear policy path, much like in other countries where they are not in conflict and they're cyclical. Because what is NREGA? NREGA is not an anti-poverty program. I mean, people think it's that. It's actually a shock responsive safety net. So if you're in the middle of a shock, if you're dealing with something, you respond. We can argue whether it actually responds in some places and it doesn't in others based on local capacity. But I think you need to think very carefully about what are the different instruments of welfare you're putting in. It has to be a balance. You know, often, and now I realize I'm going into a rant on welfare policy and I will try and be brief, but there are three instruments of welfare. One is what we call protective measures, which is after you have fallen into poverty, it protects the poor, right, that you won't fall further below in your income. So it's almost exposed. There are preventive measures, which tend to be much more co-financed because essentially you use your money now to save for a crisis in the future, so social insurance. And there are promotional measures, so that's skill training, livelihoods programs, all these kinds of things. If you look at countries that have a healthy fiscal balance, right, of welfare, they use the three based on what the local economy looks like. So, you know, context where they are relying much more on agriculture, very susceptible to drought. You'll see, you know, crop insurance mixed with food rations within NREGA, right, like some example like that. India actually has, you know, the great privilege of having all these different contexts because right now we have a welfare context where you have the same welfare programs running in urban, well, Maharashtra as well as Delhi. That makes no sense because actually even the amount of transfers that you need to give people are very different based on local consumption baskets, local minimum wage. We have no policy articulation right now on how to tackle this balance. And I think to me it's going to be one of the most important questions as economists, politicians, anyone in the sort of technocratic welfare domain space. Right now I know we're in this political moment where everybody wants deeper transfers and support because there are some communities that are hurting. But I actually think the really important question is to think about how do we move from just thinking of it as just transfers to thinking of it as a policy path which is fiscally sustainable so that those conflicts can be ironed out a bit. Or you have platforms just like GST, you have platforms which are center state which can organize then if there are conflicts which might happen. I think that's"

        "message": "really the need of the hour. I think one thing that I completely agree with, Amit, is that I think poverty is a bigger problem than inequality. And I think when we focus too much on inequality then we are trying to solve a problem using policy actions and measures which may not necessarily address inequality and it creates a lot of other distortions in the process. And I think there's unambiguous evidence from the history of economic growth so to speak that the one thing that really works in terms of uplifting people from poverty and improving their living standards is growth. And there are, for example, my favorite examples of four countries which have made the transition from a developing country status to an OECD developed country status which is Israel, Chile, South Korea, and Taiwan. And none of them did this using purely a redistributive model of development so to speak. I mean they exclusively focused on growth promoting measures which was supported by the governments and that is what helped them to make the transitions. I think there is no running away from the fact that the most important thing we need to be focusing on is growth and that is what's going to help over a period of time to alleviate poverty which is what has happened over the last several decades barring the last few years when even growth itself has stalled in India. And I think by focusing too much on inequality and there is a trade-off. The trade-off is because the fiscal resources of the government are finite and the reason they are also finite is because once you are struggling on growth you're automatically your tax to GDP ratio which is what the measure of fiscal prowess of the government is that gets compromised right. If you're not able to sort of increase the tax base then you are limited to a certain finite amount of tax to GDP and if you're not able to enlarge it then you're sort of trying to choose between I have 100 rupees what do I allocate this 100 rupees to. I have to do this 460 for welfare schemes. I have to do public good provision. I also have to do other things and I think the Indian state is really very badly stretched out in thousands of directions right. I mean they are trying to do some rudimentary provision of public good and struggling at that. They're trying to do welfare schemes they're struggling at that and they are doing many other things that they should not be doing and of course struggling at that right. So you have this really finite limited fiscal resources which are being pulled at from multiple angles and then you're choosing that what fire am I going to put out and what battle am I going to fight and what's going to give me the highest returns in terms of let's say winning elections and staying in power. And in the process what definitely gets compromised is growth because the state is doing a thousand things which are inimical to growth in the country and they need to figure out that okay let's take a step back from all of these things and let growth take its course and yes when there are rare events when there are catastrophic events we need to have the budget to spend at that point of time which is what the government was not able to do this time because for years you've just been on a spending spree and when the time comes for you to actually provide the stimulus and the support needed you're suddenly worried about fiscal deficit and debt. So the entire thinking about how do you support the economy in bad times how do you sort of step back and build a surplus during good times and how do you step away from this interfering into the growth which should be the job of the private sector that entire thinking has gone haywire and I think to a large extent we tend to obsess about inequality right and what inequality does I think it normalizes envy right I mean there is this thing that okay if the rich are getting richer we should be envious of that and that's just a very suboptimal outcome so to speak so for example when I teach my child or the values that I want to inculcate I don't want to tell her that be envious of the other kids in the building or the school I want to tell her that look at your own life in absolute terms build your own character and do the things that's going to make you happy irrespective of whether what the other person next to you is doing but therefore I think inequality it's the state of the nature there's inequality everywhere and I think at some point we just have to stop obsessing about the fact that economic policy actions should be catered towards addressing inequality we should focus on growth and and that is going to lead to the alleviation of poverty one thing that I do want to focus on here is I think there should be qualitative opportunities so more than income inequality or wealth inequality etc it's the qualitative opportunities that probably should receive a lot more focus on discussion and that is where again we fail because the state is being"

suddenly unexpectedly and this never happens there was some drilling at an apartment upstairs or downstairs which you heard so I went to the two flats upstairs the two flats above that then the two flats below me and finally two floors below me there were people who were drilling and they kindly offered to stop drilling they did not understand recording so I had to tell them I'm live with BBC to London and I'm going to lose a lot of money please I really did say that and then we kind of managed to sort of make them stop the drilling so I hope this episode is worth it now yeah so I mean the lot of thought-provoking stuff on welfare and growth to think about and what I'm glad about is at the fundamental level we are on the same page growth is important there's no getting away from it and in the short term you know if you can alleviate the pain of people that's a good thing and it must be done unfortunately this is often seen in dichotomous terms and my worry is that it ends up being a dichotomy in the political level but leave that aside I want to actually now you know before we go to the break and we begin with and after that we'll talk about your life Rajeshwari you are not getting away from that but before that I want to bring up one of the twitter questions because I think it leads us to an interesting area that both of you alluded to and a couple of questions Raghuram Janak asks where did we in brackets India go wrong economically in the last eight years and what should be the key area of focus going forward that's Raghuram Janak and Jordan Khosrow which is a delightful name by the way though on twitter you never know if it's the real name it you know no one on the internet knows I'm a dog you've seen that old cartoon I think it's a new yorker cartoon yeah no but we're not calling Jordan a dog I'm just saying it's a nice name and he asked when did India's economic decline start was it during Mughals or during British Raj or earlier than that stop quote and I'll attempt a brief answer to that and saying that no you don't need to go so far back the truth is that our economic governance has been miserable for most of our history there was a golden 20-year period from 1991 to 2011 when things were looking up and were moving in the right direction and for the last 10 11 years or so it's been a disaster I've got an episode with Pooja Mehra called the lost decade um on her book about you know how all of this happened she takes you into the weeds and you get to learn exactly in terms of policy what went wrong and it started going wrong before this particular dispension and this particular dispension of course made it much worse for reasons Rajeshwari mentioned like demonetization the boss GST and so on and I've also done an episode on the 1991 reforms about why we did have that 20 year old golden period and you know in in terms of specific policies and how our way of thinking changed you know and and the point that I want to underscore here is that a number of the questions are also talking about how right-wing economists have gone wrong and I feel that this is people conflate Modi's economic policies with right-wing just because socially it's called right-wing I think the spectrum of left and right in India doesn't really work but if you really look at it all of India's economics except for parts of the 20-year period have been statist and therefore left-wing in a sense markets haven't been allowed to play I had the congress politician Salman soz on the show and Salman said that in 2014 when Modi won he was actually optimistic because of the noises Modi had made about freeing up markets and getting away from statism Modi did nothing of that he doubled down on policies of the past he showed the top-down central planning of Nehru he showed the authoritarian streak of Indira if anything the ruthlessness of Sanjay Gandhi even and so on and so forth which is why we are in this mess so this perception that some people have that oh you know left-wing versus right-wing in economics it's all fundamentally statist and there is no freedom at all in fact all our parties are left on economics and right on social issues as Arun Shourie famously said you know a UPA is equal to NDA plus cow and of course these days I think what we sort of need to worry about is a cow aspect of it of how our society is torn apart and there was another question from twitter from a gentleman named Rohit Ripati saying how long can economists ignore the coming apart of the social fabric it's a serious question and to this I just want to say that hey economists are not ignoring any coming apart of the social fabric economists are people just like people are and every economist I know is you know aghast at it and there's another question which this is a good time to address where someone I won't name because I'm going to diss the question I asked about you know what question should I ask you guys and this person said quote ask them what they were doing in the Neeti Aayog when this government ran down the economy into pieces ask why did they whitewash Modi stop good why did you guys whitewash Modi I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about at this point of time I think this particular gentleman just saw the word economist and got enraged and triggered by that and went off into this rant and the truth is that I actually have a filter for who I allow on the show and one of my litmus tests is that if you supported demonetization you are never coming on the show right I made one quasi exception for Arvind Subramaniam and I asked him all the tough questions so if anyone feels that I don't ask stuff don't get those people on and and we had a very civil conversation but I asked all the tough questions including about demon I think"

that the trust in data is gone right and once again when we say data here people are not making the distinction between official private government to them the trust in data is gone and so if you're quoting some numbers and telling me this is what is happening how do i even know that i can trust those numbers and that is it's like at the core and heart of economics as a social science you can't even trust the numbers what are you going to talk about analyzing the numbers and coming up with interpretations right and this i completely agree what what shan also said is that earlier the situation i mean we've always had state capacity problems even in data collection and data generation but it was never as dire as it is today because we never had a situation of suppression of official data and the moment the government starts suppressing data you obviously start feeling very alerted that what exactly is going on in the economy how bad is the situation that the government feels the need to suppress something as big as a consumption survey result right so and on what has happened over the last five six years is that despite repeated criticisms writing uh we have all talked about it in public forums written about it done research on it beat the gdp data beat the consumption data employment unemployment survey there has been no addressing from the side of the government there has been no acknowledgement that is there is a problem and we're looking into it right or there has been no steps taken by the statistical organization of the country that okay yes we are going to do abc in order to address some of these problems and because it has been a one-sided criticism sort of we are lamenting and we are complaining and we are criticizing with nothing coming from the other side i think at some point people just give up and say fine we can't just use the official data anymore because but but but what i feel a little bit sad about is that we we know that the gdp data for example has problems but we still continue to look at the gdp data to understand how the economy is doing right because the nso etc have not taken any steps to address the problems people have sort of forgotten about it right it's like the memory is very short short-lived and now we have normalized the problems and we have internalized it and we are going forward with it which is quite problematic because that legitimizes all the problems that exist in the series still for example when i tell my students to do research explicitly tell them you can't use gdp as a continuous time series for 50 years there is a break in between but how many people are really going to be doing that so therefore the conclusions that you're getting could be erroneous at different levels but that is just one official series on multiple other series what happens is when you can't trust one big official data as i said that gets influenced into all the other series which number can you trust which you cannot i for example have a hard time trusting any official data and which is very bad for a macroeconomist because for macro you have to use official data so what i end up doing is i have started looking a lot to my micro data and micro data coming from private sources of course one huge source of data is center for monitoring in an economy the cmi has done massive public service by collecting all the data at a firm level at the firm level at the household's level the only problem is it's not going to be accessible to the common person because it is expensive right it's subscription based you can't subscribe to a cmi data just like that so i think there it probably the responsibility lies with economists like us who can access the data to make it accessible to the common person in whichever form and shape we can so i think looking at micro data is the way to go you can't look at macro official level data anymore and look at a large number of disaggregated series so for example i would look at two-wheeler sales i would look at auto sales right all of these data coming from so even if they're coming from different ministries and different departments at least there i have the hope that not everything in disaggregated level is messed up right so you look at a bunch of disaggregated series and you try to piece a story together and you sort of back it up using micro level data from private sources i think the way to go for india increasingly is private data i think we have to move away from this official monopoly over data because we have seen the risks and the dangers associated with that and the lack of accountability and lack of credibility and transparency right so i think at some point of time we have to realize that there has to be a lot of private sector involvement in data data collection data generation data dissemination in whichever form and shape it can be because at least there is a little bit more accountability there because they are they are responsible to their shareholders or to whoever the stakeholders are um so they're hopefully not going to be as uh you know sort of ignorant about or or careless about all of these problems so i definitely think that private sector data and to the extent possible primary level data collection i think secondary data the moment is collected by government agencies runs into all these problems so surveys conducted by private organizations like cmie if you get funding conducting own surveys to get i mean i'm talking about researchers at this point of time right primary level data and and that's that's real tragic because you know it takes up a lot of time effort energy to even put the data together and we are far away from even reaching the state where you can analyze the data and say something about the economy so to answer the question on twitter i honestly don't have a good answer to that i mean what do i say for example to my mother who just asks me okay what number do i look at to understand you know is the future for the next five years going to be good or bad or how is the economy doing after the pandemic i don't know what to say to her i mean am i going to sit and explain to her or look at abc series of course not so i think it's a it's a feeling by the way not just in india i think it's happening all over the world all over the world there is problem with data i was i was in in paris 2019 before the lockdown happened and there was a big oecd level data conference and the main title of the conference was trust in official statistics so it's a problem that's happening in ems and developing countries all over the world i mean we have always known china has data problems and now we have woken up to the reality that all ems have data problems so i think private sector collecting data primary level survey primary level data collection that's the way to go i mean we have to increasingly move away from government data sources although and i think the challenge here is going to be i i i i support"

        "message": "twitter and perhaps things will occur to me as well sure so i uh had a question for shreyana i was listening to the podcast which i thoroughly loved um and i told you on the email as well that i really like the way you combine the bollywood pop culture with economics and labor market outcomes which i mean i would have never even thought about so the question that i had i guess was that so the way you are sort of you know the way shahrukh khan enters into the book is basically the fact that he's sort of more much more of a feminist actor compared to the other actors of his generation in the sense that he's much more caring and his his views towards women and the way he deals with women is very different from the way his iconography is different from the way the other big actors of his time would deal with and that is what makes women relate to him a lot more i guess than or rather become his fans much more than than others so basically you know i mean he comes across as much more of a person that women feel comfortable with or women feel that they want that kind of a boyfriend or a husband who's going to be giving importance to them etc etc so i guess that the doubt that i had which is just pure doubt just as i was listening to the podcast is that you're an amir fan is that no i'm not i'm not a fan of anyone in bollywood per se but but basically i think the question that i had was that is isn't it fair to say that while shahrukh i mean the way he was in most of the portrayal of the roles that he did in the movies at the same time all the women actresses in his movies they didn't really have a lot to do per se and now hear me out when i let me finish this so what i'm trying to say is that even if you take a classic movie like ddlj right where it's true i mean the boy falls in love with girl and it's all very romantic and it's all very nice and he's dealing with simran is also very nice and caring and loving and sweet and all of that but ultimately he's the one who does the entire job of convincing simran's parents he's the one who goes all the way to india he's the one who's doing all the quoting and convincing and you know all of that and while the girl is just sitting demurely waiting for him to be done with whatever he's doing so that you know they can get together so she doesn't really have a whole lot of things to do in the second half of the movie and likewise for example if i think of either you know or all the other movies of that particular time period the women don't really have a lot to do i mean i'm not talking about women having agency but i'm just saying that other than romancing or other than you know the romantic complications that entail in the movies there's not a whole lot that the women are actually doing in terms of you know do they have jobs what is their viewpoints what is their choice across different men are they even exercising a choice what agency do they have etc and if i contrast that and maybe this was reflective of the way society was back then that we were liberalizing but we still had a lot of hangover of the past of tradition women not really playing a very powerful role in society and family etc and if i contrast that to now for example i mean some of the movies that i have seen let's say Vicky Kaushal comes to mind and i'm not talking about the person as you know whether i'm a fan or not but i'm just saying the roles that he essays so for example you have a movie like Manmarzia where there is a woman who has a choice between two men and he actually exercises the choice to go with one and not the other or for example there is love per square foot where the girl and the boy decide to get married because each of them wants to own a home whereas love and romance is not the reason for the marriage the girl has as much agency as the boy does or for example even Alia Bhatt movies like for example a highway where she chooses to stay with the abductor because she doesn't want to go back home and then when the abductor is killed she just abandons her own family and goes to the mountains and does her own business and builds a home which is tremendous amount of energy agency on part of a young girl again other examples so i guess you know Priyanka Chopra in Dil Dharakne Do this movie that i have seen recently where she she gets a divorce and she manages the father's business which is again tremendous amount of agency on part of a woman and in fact the brother which is Ranveer Singh is being portrayed as a good for nothing so i think that's just a marked departure even Yeh Jawani Hai Diwani i mean Ranveer Kapoor being a very lovey-dovey boy but then Deepika Padukone in that movie has a job i mean she's a medical student who's very good in her studies we don't ever see her"

        "message": "first of all to answer that that first question i absolutely love being an economist even today and my sense is i continue to love being that the foreseeable future because for me it's almost like combining passion with profession um so i think this i briefly mentioned in the first episode with amit as well that when i was studying economics i didn't really think of myself as an economist of course far from it i didn't even know what i was going to become and i was sort of in the rigmarole of the indian rat race or whatever you call it that i was going from one step to the other i was doing my graduation post-graduation i think when i was doing my post-grad at some point of course i started realizing that i do like the subject for what it is um and this was also the time when india had liberalized right this was early 2000s and it was completely like the way i call it roaring 2000s in india and mind you i had i was coming from calcutta which was the communist bastion and there of course any sign of liberalization privatization was significantly more muted um and but to the extent that i was witnessing it it was a delight for me because you've been born in the 80s and you witness that you actually live through the transition of it in real life and then i went to delhi for my post-grad and of course delhi was like an eye-opener it was a culture shock and an eye-opener both at the same time and and then when i was studying my post-grad i i think my love for economics had started in presidency college when i was doing my undergrad when i went to delhi i was massively disillusioned because in delhi everything was extremely competitive it was about getting a job it was about you know showing off what your salary is and all of that thing and that was exactly not what i had in mind when i was sitting in presidency college library and idealizing about books and stuff and whatnot and therefore i had that period of disillusionment and i actually went to the corporate world it was also fear of missing out all my friends were doing it i wanted to do it as well so i went to the corporate world i did not like it at all um and that's when i think that hankering back to what i had felt during my undergrad studies in presidency came back and i realized that let me give it a shot and let me actually try my hand at research and see if i'm really cut out for it if i'm going to do it and i think that's when i finally seriously started thinking of economics as a profession as a calling and then i went to the u.s to do my phd but even throughout the u.s it was again learning about what we called talked about in the beginning of the episode learning about the theories the models you're basically going through the entire program of it and while i was still doing research it was very mechanical right because i wanted to get a phd i wanted to get some papers out so i was okay i was doing fine but i wasn't particularly the passion for economics and all of that i didn't really feel it per se and then i came back to india and later on we can talk about in different episode why what when and when i came back to india the the funny thing that happened was that i actually had to leave india go to the u.s and come back to india and do all of that journey to finally become an economist and think of myself as an economist and i started sort of like feeling the juice of the subject so to speak because when i came back to india i came to igid in bombay and i met a wonderful bunch of people two of whom are going to be here later on in the evening and they completely changed the way i think about economics the way i wanted to apply economics i was in that zone where like my phd advisor i would write papers get published in the journal you know be a university academic economist that that that myth was completely dispelled when i met this bunch of people and i realized that economics can be a lot more fun than that it can be a lot more it can be made a lot more accessible to people than that and i can have a lot more fun by studying the backyard which is the indian economy because until then i hadn't thought of indian economy at all right because in my mind it was the american university working on economic theories being at the frontier of research and for the first time i strictly exactly remember 2014 was the year when i started thinking that i might do some work on indian economy it will not get published in journals because nobody's interested in indian economy i will never get a job abroad again because it's macro who's interested in indian macro and i was fine with all the trade-offs it was the decision that i had to take that i was fine with these trade-offs because what what lies on offer for me was very very exciting and that's when i got involved in the drafting of the bankruptcy law now for an economist trained in the us if you were to tell me seven years or eight years back before that that i was going to be involved in the drafting of a law i would have thought you know what are you kidding about i mean my friend economists in the us have no idea about how laws are drafted etc but i got involved in the drafting of the ibc which was the most exciting exhilarating experience ever till date i mean for five months we would just think breathe bankruptcy laws which was not even my area per se right but i started understanding how indian economy works how different vested interests work and that's basically the start of my journey as an economist it's as recent as that and then since then i've just been focusing on india and as i said you know it doesn't get me a lot of top journal publications it will never get me a job outside india if i ever want to go outside anywhere but the satisfaction is is enormous my friends who are economists in the us would not even remotely come close to the idea of drafting a law because they are just so far away from the policy and the legal space of it whereas what happened with me was that i got to know a whole bunch of very interesting lawyers policymakers no academic economists so to speak what is called mainstream academic economist and it was a whole lot of fun i mean i was basically just having fun i was called by the jpc in the parliament to depose i mean i was in a completely different world from what i had visualized when i started my phd and then i i just fell in love with it i just fell in love with the idea of understanding indian economy uh giving it back to the best possible way that i can which is through teaching my students writing in the media doing a whole lot of talk shows uh panel discussions so i just make myself available whenever i get an invitation because that's my way of getting my own concepts right and also getting the concepts accessible to whoever is listening out so i think i've had a complete ball of a time since 2015 and knock on wood and and i hope i anticipate that that's going to continue going forward and as i said this is nothing the way i had visualized mainstream economics was going to be and to a large extent the credit lies to the people that i got to know in 2014 2015 who got tremendous influences in my life and yeah i mean i'm just having a whole lot of fun at this point of time although everything that the economy has gone down south since then but just analyzing it and mind you i mean before 2014 i didn't even think of the indian economy per se right and now i'm really into understanding what's happening what's going on how can i do better how can i teach my students better what articles can i write in lay person's language so that people can understand and it's it's challenging it's it's exciting so yeah i really like it so yeah it's definitely not the economist i never had a vision of myself as an economist when i went to the u.s i thought i was going to be one of those tenure-track university professors i'm so glad and relieved that i came back and tremendously grateful to the people who have influenced me um and i think i'm just very very"
