        "message": "2022 has just come to an end, and so will we. Given our mortality, it's astonishing that we are such an arrogant species. We behave, at an individual and collective level, as if we are immortal. We know almost nothing about the vast and complex universe around us, but we have full conviction in the stories we tell ourselves about it. And we are just beginning to get to grips with our own bodies. For most of human history, we knew so little about the flesh and bones that we are made of. Not long ago, we even thought the brain was a part of the heart. Now, while our arrogance remains as unjustified as before, we have more reason to hope. Science has brought us to a place where we understand our bodies better. We understand our different organs, the way nature reacts upon us, the origin of diseases. And sure, there's still a lot to figure out. But we know the methods and the mindset we need to keep progressing. The method is scientific, where everything must be evidence-based and open to falsification. The mindset is humble, curious, sceptical. Now, sure, we can't live forever. But we can live the lives that we do live, longer and better. And to do this, to keep progressing, we need to embrace science and put aside superstition."

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma. Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is the outstanding doctor scientist, Abbey Phillips. I first heard of Abbey from Dinesh Thakur, who recorded a memorable episode with me called The Dark Side of Indian Pharma. Abbey is known as the liver doctor on Twitter, and he is a fearless rationalist. For years now, he has been debunking different kinds of quackery that calls itself alternative medicine. The term is a misnomer. Modern medicine is evidence-based medicine. And the so-called alternative medicine systems are not evidence-based. They're not medicine at all. Abbey has been attacked both by big corporations peddling nonsense products and by the Ministry of Ayush. But he continues his crusade because it is important. As a liver doctor, he's seen countless patients whose livers have been damaged because they popped what they thought was a harmless herbal supplement or an Ayurvedic medicine, etc. etc. The myths around these are many. But lives are at stake and those myths must be fought. I've admired the way in which Abbey has done that. And I've written various articles about the dangers of homeopathy and Ayurveda as well. I'll link them all from the show notes as well as some excellent books on the subject by the likes of Ben Goldacre and Simon Singh. Abbey flew down to Mumbai a few weeks ago to record this episode. And we only spoke about quackery in the second half. In the first half, we spoke about Abbey's journey, what the medical ecosystem in India is like, the incentives doctors deal with, the trade-offs they face, the ethical dilemmas they encounter, and why Abbey chose not just to be a doctor, but to be a scientist as well. He's published 165 papers and done pioneering work in reversing liver cirrhosis. There is much wisdom in this episode. And it's an important episode that can affect lives. So please do listen to it and please share widely, not just among doctors and medical students, but among all of us. I mean, we all have bodies, and we should all embrace science and shun dangerous dogma. One of the ways in which I've changed my life is that I try to understand my body better. And science has brought us to a place where we can finally begin to understand our own programming. This episode is sponsored by MapMyGenome, a pathbreaking company that gives you different kinds of insight about your own body. And I'm specifically interested in the latest offering called MedicaMap. Now, simply put, this is a DNA test that looks at over 10,000 markers across 8000 genes and figures out your body's response to 170 FDA-approved drugs, which include medicines for the common cold and headaches, all the way to far more complex ailments that I can't even pronounce. Basically, here's the deal. How does your body respond to different diseases and different medicines for them? MedicaMap gives you granular understanding of your own body and opens a possibility of personalized treatment for anything that might happen to you.

        "message": "grow up and so on? Oh, yeah, I mean, and this is going to be very nostalgic for me, because I miss those days. Actually, I was actually born in a small town called Kuthattukulam that's in Kottayam in Kerala. And my dad is a doctor. He's a senior gastroenterologist. And my mom is a housewife. So I'm the third of four. I have an elder brother, an elder sister and a younger sister. And most of my childhood, I mean, till the fourth grade, I spent in Chungam, in a place called Chungam. And my father used to work in this hospital called Devamada Hospital in Kottayam, in Devamada Kuthattukulam. And he used to visit us maybe twice a week. He used to stay there and work there. And a lot of my childhood was actually seeing my father's work, the doctors that come to our houses. I mean, he never used to bring his work home. That was something my father did. But he was always very passionate. So a lot of my childhood was actually with my siblings. You know, we had a very good time. It was those times where, you know, sip ups were the greatest thing. I mean, you have these frozen orange drinks and you suck it out of that. You know, it's not a sip up during those times. I think it's obsolete now. You don't get it. It's extinct now. So those are our little joys. So I was born in Kottayam. And then we moved to Cochin in 1992 when my dad joined this hospital called as PVS Hospital. And further from there onwards, we've been in Cochin. And since 92, I've joined, I did my schooling in this place called Chinmaya Vidyalaya. So I've done my school, schooling everything in a Hindu school where we used, we had to learn Sanskrit and, you know, we used to do the Vishnu Sahasranama every Thursday. And my schooling till 12th was there. Fantastic place. I just loved it. And post 12th, I actually tried for medicine because my brother directly jumped into computer engineering and he left the country and he's now currently settled in the US. His name is Augustine. My sister became an artist. So after her master's in art, she moved to the US and now she's in LA and she runs an independent art installation services there. And my younger sister, she became a musician and left the country. So I was the, I was the medicine or engineering scapegoat who was in, who stayed back. So then I tried getting into MBBS after my 12th, but I did not get through. A lot of my classmates got through, which was devastating for me because we all went to the same coaching center. So at that time there was, there were no major coaching centers like we have now. We have Cerebellum, Prapaladar, Marrow, a lot of stuff happening now. But at that time we just had one place called as P.C. Thomas coaching classes in Thrissur, another town in another city in Kerala. And we used to go there every Sunday, attend the classes and come back. And unfortunately I did not get through the first time. I think I did not study well. I was not, I was not very serious about studies at that time. And, but then when I saw that my friends actually went into the next phase in their life and I was still stuck there, I joined P.C. Thomas coaching classes as a full-time student. And I studied for about a year there, staying in their hostel. That hostel was like a military hostel. And I think it actually helped me realize, you know, the importance of discipline in life. So that is where I actually started spending time reading. And through that, I got through after two years of attempts, I got through for MBBS at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore. And I completed my MBBS in 2007 from St. John's. And again, it's again, I mean, the whole aspect of Indian medicine is, I mean, Indian medical system is to, you know, you have to keep studying, keep studying because you're not going to go do well with a basic degree. So the next was to go for MD in internal medicine, because I never liked surgery. I can't stand the sight of blood and I cannot stand for long hours and do work. So I was going to go for medical field, not a surgical field. So I again, and it's all about again, sitting and attempting, you know, again, a competitive examination, like what we have neat now, we had AIPGMT at that time, All India Postgraduate Entrance Test. And I gave it, did not get through the first time, gave a second time, did not get through. And ultimately, I think on my third attempt, I got through in general medicine at Nirlathan Sarkar Medical College through a government merit. And I started my MD in general medicine there. So I did three years in Calcutta. And after three years, it's again, you know, you have to do something super specialization, you're not going to do really well in your life with just a MBBS or an MD degree. So then I was totally lost. I did not know what to do. So I mean, my dad was, he's a gastroenterologist. So he, I mean, he is very important for me, because what he tells me through my, I mean, at each and every important phase of my life where I wanted to make a decision, I think his words actually was the most important. So he actually told me to, you know, if you get into a government medical college, take it. So that is how I ended up in Calcutta. And I think Calcutta was the most important phase of my life. That is where I actually understood what diseases can do to families and what poverty is and how it is to work with minimal or no resources for people. And that is where I understood that it's not just medicine or prescriptions, but a kind word, a good deed, a pat on the shoulder, a hug, all these matter for patients and the family. And that actually changed everything. And my professors were so, I mean, I think they are like a dying breed. You don't get professors and teachers like that anymore. They never let us do any unnecessary investigations or tests. In my three years in Calcutta, only thing I think I've probably done about three or four MRI of the brain. That's it. Otherwise, it's just clinical examination and identifying where exactly the problem is in the brain. And that is how they teach you. So all of this happened in Calcutta. And when my dad, I mean, I was very, very happy that, I mean, it was very difficult for me to actually cope with the life in Calcutta initially, because when I did my MBBS, it was all very nice because St. John's Medical College is very cool, very beautiful campus and things are so nice there for students. So when I went into a government medical college, initially, I mean, we were like four of us in a room along with rats and cats and everything around. And it was so difficult for me, but then I had to adjust to it. And when I adjusted to it, I understood that, you know, these things are not at all important, your work and your, your profession, your career, the way you think and help people out in need is more important. So all of that actually, you know, came to a very nice climax. It was not an anti-climax in Calcutta. So after that, when I was thinking of doing my DM, that is a super speciality in gastroenterology, my dad told me, you know, please don't do gastroenterology. But I said, you know, you are a gastroenterologist. It's like, you know, you have to be a gastroenterologist. So he said, no, absolutely not. Because gastroenterology is now going to get very soon going to get saturated like cardiology is because now everybody is going to split out into cardiology. Like there is some, there are super specialities inside cardiology now. Like you have people taking care of only arrhythmias and rate problems, heart and rhythm problems, people looking into surgeries, people who are only into intervention and things like that. So he said that gastroenterology is going to get saturated. So please go for hepatology. So after my MD, what happened was that, I mean, I mean, just before my MD, I mean, just after my MBBS, well, I was just loafing around, not getting in anywhere. My dad actually sent me to Delhi and he said there is this person called Professor Shiv Sarin at GB Panth Hospital. He is one of the top guys in gastroenterology and hepatology. Actually, he is actually one of the pillars of hepatology in the country. Please go and be with him, talk to him and work under him and see how you like hepatology. So I went there as a junior research fellow. So, I mean, very, very charismatic man. He took me in and he made me a JRF, a junior research fellow and I started working under him in basic sciences. So there was no clinical exposure at all. But what happened was that because it was all basic sciences and I was never, never interested in basic sciences. I used to actually hate basic sciences subjects in my MBBS and during preparation for my MD, I actually went into depression there. So I was staying alone in some place in Karol Bagh and I was alone at the, this room was very close to the terrace, attached to the terrace and when it rains, my room used to get flooded and I had to keep cleaning my room. And I did that for about three months and I got very depressed. I stopped eating and that was the first time I actually understood what depression was because I did not want to go to GBPAN. I did not want to work there. I just hated the whole thing. But I said, you know, but my dad said, you know, if, if you actually go and start taking interest in what Professor Serene was going to teach you, maybe you will find something good out of it. So I tried for another month, but then I was really losing it. So one day I told my dad and mom, you know, I think I'm really going into depression. I don't, I can't actually get myself up out of the bed to go out in the morning. And I started taking sedatives myself to go to sleep and things like that, because it was really tough for me. So he, my dad came there and the moment I said that I'm not getting things in the right sense, he came there the next day. He took me, got a flight and took me back to Cochin. And then he said, okay, you do something. Joined for coaching in, you know, in Thrissur, there is this Thrissur medical college, alumni association. They do a coaching for post-graduates like for, for MD exams. So I joined there and very, I mean, surprisingly, and I was very happy that one of my colleagues, my batch mates from MBBS actually was also coming there. So we both got a room and we started studying together and I spent about nine to 11 months there in Thrissur. I mean, the first time I spent was at PC Thomas for MBBS. And again, I went back to Thrissur to study for my MD also. And I spent about 11 months there and both of us wrote the exam. And that is when I cracked the exam and got into Calcutta, near the Sarkar Medical College. Now the best part is when I left Delhi, as a research fellow, I told my sir, I don't think this is for me. I want to do, I want to be a clinical doctor and not get stuck in basic sciences. Sir told me, you know, I want you to come back to me because it's the whole aspect of gastroenterology and hepatology is not about just clinical practice or skill. If you know, and if you love basic sciences, then you can actually make a difference for your patients. He just told me that. And I said, I'm always here. If you want to do this, please come back to me. So after the MD exams got over and I was looking at taking up gastroenterology and my dad said, you know, no, you take up hepatology. And he said, you know, Professor Sareen has now moved out of GB Panth and he started this new, he became the director and started under the government, a new institute known as Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, ILBS at Vasant Kunj in Delhi. So he said they have a DM hepatology program now and go, go there and be with him and see what he, what he has for you. So I went to ILBS and I again met with Professor Sareen. So he said, see, paths have come again and across again. So what, what I did was that I joined as a senior resident there that is post MD, you are a non-academic resident. You actually work like in a salaried position, but you're not part of the academic program yet. And I worked there for a whole year and I just fell in love with hepatology because the stuff that they were doing there was something so different from what I have been seeing in MBBS or MD. The kind of research work, the kind of work that actually changes perspectives in patient management, cutting edge work was being done there. Small animal experiments, cellular tissue based experiments, pure clinical research experiments. I mean, this was like a completely different form of clinical medicine that I have experienced. And then, and there I decided, you know, hepatology is the place because hepatology is one of the most extreme forms of internal medicine. If you take general medicine, hepatology is the most extreme format because you have to know about every system to actually practice hepatology. And what I did was I, at that time gave them, I mean, they have an entrance exam. So I gave the entrance exam for the, for ILBS Institute. And also I gave entrance exam for All India Institute, AIIMS. That I had to give because everybody's giving it. You know, it's like you're, you know, you have to give AIIMS. If you don't give AIIMS, that means you are not deserving. So I gave AIIMS just like that, but I got into ILBS and then I did my DM, super speciality in ILBS. And I completed that in 2016, 2015, 2016. And in 2016, I came back home and started working as a counselor in hepatology in Cochin. So this is my journey from a small town in Kottayam and back to Cochin, then to Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, and back to Cochin."

        "message": "It's such a fascinating story. And there are many things I want to double click on. I want to sort of take you back in a sense to your childhood, but the theme that I want to ask you on kind of plays across. I want to ask you about, as a doctor, where does one get one's values from? And not just as a doctor, I think in any profession, we see that there are people who are just going through the motion, there's a career for them, they have ladders to rise up. And, you know, you can actually lose all engagement with what you are really doing, which in your case is human beings, I guess, in a sense, and you can lose that engagement and go through the motions and climb that path. But there are others who have this deeper conviction that there is a greater meaning to what I am doing. And you can see this in journalism, where most journalists might be going through the motions, but a few will be no, it is a higher calling. Perhaps you can see it in the law, you can definitely see it in medicine, you know. So we'll hear about how, for example, these days the incentives are tailored in such a way that doctors are asking for test after test after test, because, you know, they get more money and so on and so forth. But as you pointed out in Calcutta, when you were learning that was discouraged. And what I see from, you know, first time we've met, but from what I see from following you on Twitter and elsewhere, is that there's a deep engagement with your work, you really care about the thing that you're doing, right? So tell me a little bit about where you think this comes from, like how much did your father have to do with this? Tell me a bit about your father, what, you know, what kind of values that you grew up with just outside of the medical context also,"

        "message": "you know? Yeah, I mean, I think we can have a whole episode on my dad. Yeah, so my dad, his name is Philip Augustine. He is actually, I'm actually searching for words, you know, because he's such a complex man, in the sense that, you know, he's dedicated his life completely to medicine and people. And what I have actually seen him do is that I mean, I don't think I can be like him ever, because he's he's him. And I cannot be like him. People actually can't expect me to be like him also, because he's him. What happened? I mean, when I look at him and his work, he's actually one of the first gastroenterologists in the country. And actually one of the first gastroenterologists to actually went into interventional gastroenterology doing endoscopies and procedures like endoscopies and procedures like ERCPs, first time in the state doing very, very expert procedures like transjugular liver biopsies, that is where you actually go through a vein, a vessel and go into the liver and take a tissue of the liver and then come out through the same vessel out. So these kind of extreme liver biopsies, extreme procedures, he was actually the first to do it in the state. And he's one of the founding fathers of gastroenterology in the country. He's also a Padma award winner. And all of that is because of the quality and the dedication that he has actually shown to his work. So what I have seen him do is that he brings when I when I initially said that he does not bring his work home, it's in the sense that he does not bring his burden of work home. But he's always available for his patients at all times. I have actually seen him pick up phone calls at 2am and 3am in between his sleep, and talking to patients, patient families, bystanders and telling them what needs to be done. And he's always available 24 seven on that phone. When I if I do that now, make myself available 24 seven, I mean, I think I just have to be in the hospital. I mean, I can't do that at home, because people will keep calling me and you know, but for him, that's not a burden. He actually takes it as a duty, something that he's bound to do and which he enjoys. And he I mean, I have seen him always helping out he never says no to a phone call from a patient or or I mean, I've actually seen him take calls and from total strangers and give them advice on the phone saying that you know, you need to do this test and do that and then come back to me and then we'll take a decision on it. You know, I see an unknown number, I don't pick it up. I mean, that's that's a normal behavior, but not for him. Because he feels that that number he has to pick up because they want some help or they are in need and he has to do it. So that's that that's the kind of person my father is. So I think that compassion part comes from him. Because deep inside, I've seen him help people and how satisfied he is with his life. My dad has actually I mean, if you look at from the point of my dad's story is actually quite bittersweet. He was actually a pure academician at one point, had one of the best publications ever. At that time, it's it's not not so easy like we do publications now here we just upload electronically. And then they send us revisions and we do everything through the computer. But at the time there was no computer there was everything was a typewriter. So he used to actually type everything all his publications and then send it to the journal as a hard copy. Then after months, they correct and send it back. Then again, he makes corrections and then sends it back. So publication used to take months and months and months at that time. And it's all in type through the typewriters. And he used to be dedicated in that. And what happened was that once he moved to Cochin and he started and his practice actually started flourishing because he's a he's a people's doctor and obviously other doctors don't actually refer to him much. The first time I've actually seen that in my life is patients referring other patients. So his patients when they're satisfied, they go back and they bring more patients for him. So that was a patient to patient referral. And it was like, it was like that was a peak of his game at the time when he used to see about 120 patients a day. He still does, by the way, without any complaints. And what what happened was that at that point, he started talking thinking about entrepreneurship. So he wanted to create an environment where health care was going to be affordable and it was going to be lightning quick. So that is when he created this through a lot of I mean, he actually went to a lot of places to a lot of people got a lot of people in they funded. It was a public funded company and he made a Lakeshore Hospital. It was one of the top. I mean, it's still it is still there. It was a top hospital in Cochin Lakeshore Hospital Research Center Limited. And he was a director, a managing director of the hospital for a very long time, more than 10-12 years. And it was flourishing like anything. So I was actually doing my MBBS and MD at the time. And what happened was that when something actually becomes really good and really big, somebody has to ruin it. So this company, a conglomerate from the UAE came in, and they did a lot of work behind my dad, and they actually got the hospital under them. And he was actually checked out of the position of managing director, and somebody else was instilled above him. And they brought in that old style corporate kind of work into the hospital where he was. I mean, during his time that was unheard of the corporate kind of work in Lakeshore Hospital. But they came in, they slowly moved him around. And this was like a coup, a complete coup. Without his knowledge, all of these things happened. And this is just when I was finishing my DM. And what happened was that that hospital was his baby. And he quit. He just quit. And what he did was he was like a fish out of water then because that was his home and that was his that was everything for him. I wanted to work more in Delhi with Professor Serene. And I wanted to actually do some fellowships and training and get to do more of basic science work and research fellowships in basic sciences out of the country, probably in the US or Europe. So that was my plan. Because I was actually speaking at the moment from basic sciences work at ILBS. At that time, my dad had to get out of Lakeshore. He had to quit. And once he quit, he was alone. So I had to go back to him. So what he planned was he was he made a company, a consultancy group known as Philip Augustine Associates. And it was just the two of us, me and my dad. And my mom is also there. I mean, she's very helpful with everything that we do and every decision my dad makes. I think my mom is the silent person who actually tells him, yes, this is the right thing to do, not just my dad. So it's both of them. And ultimately, we made this consultancy group. And I came back and I asked him, what should we do now? Because we have nowhere to go. So initially when he came to Cochin from Kottayam, he was working in this place called PVS hospital that was also in Cochin. And he had asked them if they would like, I mean, they asked him if he would come back to them because that hospital was doing very bad at the time because once he left from there to Lakeshore, it was crumbling. So I mean, we had nowhere else to go. He said, OK, we'll come there, but then you'll have to give us the chance and opportunity like we were doing in Lakeshore and we'll get it done. But things did not work out in PVS also. I also worked there. And that was the time when I actually faced a lot of professional harassment in the sense that professional enmity. I mean, I never knew doctors could become really bad to other doctors because what happened was that I was a hepatologist. So I was the second hepatologist in the state. Before me, there was another hepatologist who was trained from PJ Chandigarh and he was working in a hospital in Alua. And but he was doing both gastroenterology and hepatology. But I was a core hepatologist. I used to do only hepatology work and my work was actually well known also at the time before I came down to Cochin. And once this happened, a lot of liver patients actually started coming towards me and a lot of liver patients started getting out of the other gastroenterologists who were working as liver specialists there. A lot of them did not like it. So they made my life hell there. And ultimately, even that hospital, it was not not I mean, for us, it was not a good environment to work with, even though they did everything for us. The management was very considerate, but it was not going to be a long term thing. So we got out of that place. And again, we were like, like fish out of water. And that is when this small setup called Arunachala Medical Center, they said they wanted to improve on their activities. So they wanted us, our consultancy group to completely take over gastroenterology and hepatology work there. So a lot of the work that we did in the last four years, a lot of my research work, clinical work, everything happened in Arunachala Medical Center. So me and my dad, we went there and we started working there. And we worked there for about three and a half to four years. And it became saturated because I was not able to do more of my work. And dad wanted me to actually increase my output from a research point of view. And that was not happening there. And that is when we moved to Rajagiri Hospital, which we are in now currently. So coming back to that question, everything that I have done is somewhere or the other related to what my dad has been directly telling me or indirectly telling me. And that compassion, the reason why I developed a strong bonding with the kind of, with my profession, that is hepatology, is because he has shown me that working for patients and their families actually may not get me the money that my friends and all are getting in other professions, but it actually helps me sleep well at night. It's very satisfying to come back home when you do that kind of work. I mean, imagine you're helping out somebody who's really in need. Even if you cannot help that patient, the patient might die. It's not up to you. I mean, you are not, we are not gods to save everybody. People die. But the process, the journey that the patient and the family is on, and if you can become part of that journey, there is nothing more satisfying than that in the medical profession. So medical profession is not about seeing 120-200 patients a day or doing 500 colonoscopies and 300 endoscopies a day or, you know, getting a first car or, I mean, I still haven't bought my first car. The car that I drive now is partly funded by my father-in-law and partly by my father. I still can't buy myself a car, but I'm happy because I'm able to come back home and have a peaceful sleep. I mean, I get maybe four hours of sleep only per day, but it's good sleep. So that kind of compassionate work actually gave me that important aspect in life that when you are in a profession, the core values of that profession is what drives you. It's nothing else. That is why I don't lose focus. And my dad has actually shown me, even my dad, he is very well to do after 65 years of age, I think. You know, he actually became comfortable in life, monetarily also, I think, beyond 65 years of age. But he was always a happy man. And that is purely because of the kind of work that he was doing and he was satisfied with that kind of work. And that actually is what fuels me also to do, to actually commit myself to in-depth, that compassion and care that I want to show towards my patients and family. So yes, my dad's story and his work definitely has helped. My professors who has taught me in my master's degree has definitely helped. And definitely my main teacher is, my mentor is Professor Shiv Sarin. And his approach to patient care is, I mean, it's something so different, where he actually puts in, applies new thoughts and new research opportunities to make things better. So he was like, you know, you, you are doing something, you're following guidelines. You have an option to follow the guidelines. Or you have an option to change the guidelines for the better. So changing the guidelines for the better is more satisfactory. So that is why we do a lot of, that is how I fell in love with clinical research also. And falling in love with clinical research is actually one of the most important aspects of compassionate care for the patient. Because you do, you think out of the box for the patient and family, not for yourself, for your work. So when you say clinical research, people say that, what is there in clinical research? But I think clinical research is one of the most compassionate and core aspects of medical science."

        "message": "Yes, okay. Hepatology is basically study and management of diseases associated with the liver. So you have the liver, you have everything to do around the liver. So for example, you have the gallbladder, you have the bile ducts inside the liver that makes bile and the gallbladder stores it. Then when you eat food, the gallbladder propels the bile into the small intestine and that's how digestion happens. So anything to do with the biliary system, that is the gallbladder and bile ducts and everything, plus the liver as an organ is what hepatology is all about. And it's just one organ. My brother used to say, why are you so stressed out in your life? It's just one organ. You have so many other organs. I tell him that this is the most complicated of all organs. The largest organ in the body is skin. But and the second largest solid organ, I mean, the largest solid organ could be is definitely the liver. And it's such a complex organ and has to do with everything. So your immunity, the proteins that you make in your body, the hormones that you metabolize, the hormones that you convert in your body, you know, your digestion, your metabolic, everything happens inside. I mean, everything is controlled by the liver. You definitely need a beating heart to survive. But ultimately, what what keeps you going is the liver. So this is what hepatology is all about. And hepatology is also an additional point is that there is something more to it than from gastroenterology point of view and that is transplantation. So you have transplant medicine also coming in other than directly management of patients with liver disease. So there is transplant medicine, post transplantation also in as part of core practice in hepatology."

One of the things you mentioned about Calcutta is how you were kind of one living four to a room as far as your personal circumstances were concerned, the facilities given to you and two, you spoke about how people were so desperately poor and you came face to face with poverty and all of that. And you know, what part did that play in, you know, developing sort of empathy in you? And the other broader question there is that I think a danger for all people, not just doctors, is that you tend to forget other people are people in the sense that you are the chief character in a play inside your head. Everybody else is a prop for your amusement. Everybody everything else is instrumental, right? And you have to keep reminding yourself that other people are people too and to relate to them as human beings and all of that. And I think we often fall into a default mode where, you know, people are instrumental. And I would imagine that for a doctor, this is even a greater danger because you're always thinking of the body and the organ and the processes and your inner sense, you're dehumanizing all of those and, you know, those become things that you study. And you know, when a patient is with you, it could be tempting that that patient becomes a sum of their charts and their ailments and whatever is happening inside their body. But there is a person there who might be anxious, who might be terrified, who might be perhaps even reacting with aggression towards you simply because they're confused and they don't know how to navigate this shit. So and you mentioned that Calcutta was important for you for your kind of coming to terms with all of that. So take me a little bit through your journey, thinking about these things and sort of avoiding those traps in yourself, as it were."

        "message": "I think this part is, I think, most important when it comes to me as a doctor and taking responsibility for my patients and their family. In Calcutta, what happened was that, I mean, it was general medicine. So we used to get all kinds of cases there from snake bites to, you know, uncontrolled diabetes, infections, I mean, strokes, anything you say, anything you can actually think of. All the old world diseases also we have seen, the rabies, tetanus, you name it. And what was striking was that there was this particular patient who came with uncontrolled diabetes. And when you have, I so clearly remember this, when you have very high levels of sugar, glucose in your body, you go into a particular condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis, which is life threatening. And that is usually associated with an infection. So you have very high amounts of sugar in your body that gets converted to ketones and that ketones start harming you and you start having organ failures. So you have to treat that quickly with insulin, bring down the sugars and make sure that patient does not go into organ failures. At one point, we did not have, I mean, at one point patients were so poor, the patients with diabetic ketoacidosis that I actually admitted in the night, that patient was so poor that they could not afford, I mean, they could not even afford a simple gas medicine. You know, I mean, there are some medicines which are not in stock in government hospitals and you ask these people to actually go and buy it. Unfortunately, on that day, we did not have insulin in the hospital and we asked them to buy a vial of insulin from outside. They did not have money for that. And without insulin, this man was going to die. And it's not easy to be in that situation because you know that without that particular drug, that patient is going to die. And there was no other means for us to, you know, get insulin for them because it's a government setup. And so what we do is we hydrate these patients immensely, bring down the ketosis with good fluid therapy and things like that. But at one point, you know that this patient is going to die without insulin. So I still remember me running around the female general ward, male general wards, the chronic wards and we have chronic and acute wards there, looking at other people who would share their insulin. And at some point, I actually got a little bit of insulin for us to use for this patient. And ultimately, we gave him insulin. He was there. The ICUs were full. So we managed him in the ward. And a couple of days later, he died. And we did everything that we could. They did everything they could. But so poor, they could not even afford basic medicines. But we did keep him alive for two days with just the minimal resources that we had. At one point, I was, I was actually angry at them. Because I was like, why don't they have money? You know, they should find money. If they don't have money, they should find money. People do that all the time. You find, you find stuff. Then I realized that, you know, they, they don't have that luxury to even find money, no help, nothing. There are, there are people like that. And the best that you could do for them is to tell them that, you know, you have, you are doing everything that you can for this patient. No stones are left unturned. You have come to the right place. We are the right people. And we are also helping you, supporting you. That becomes, that's like a closure for them. Because it's not like they have not done anything for the patient. And when I spoke to them about this part, when that, when that man died, and I can actually see, they were from a Muslim community and they were actually from Murshidabad. I spoke to them and I told the son that, you know, you have done everything that you could and we did everything we could. He was actually happy to hear it from me. You know, even though it ended with his father dying, he was actually happy that, you know, they did something that everybody is supposed to do. They did not do anything that is off charts. It's not like it's not their fault. So I told them, it's not your fault. So that is when I understood that, you know, money plays such an important part in India, in management of patients. Those who have money, they can go to any extent, but those who don't have money, they cannot afford to save somebody in the family. So I took the, I mean, and that's just not one episode, multiple episodes like that happened throughout my studies in MD. And when I actually came back and started working in, I mean, and I saw, I mean, in Delhi, it was a different scenario because a lot of people who used to come there were affluent. They could afford, very few who could not. And Delhi has a very good policy where the below poverty line patients used to get free treatment and free transplant. So things were okay. There was a machinery moving around and things were fine. But when I came back here and I'm working in a private setup, a lot of these people, patients don't have any medical claim or insurance and they have to pay out of pocket. What I did initially was that the first patient I sent for a liver transplant was a young man. He was an alcoholic. No, we don't call them as alcoholic. It's alcohol associated or alcohol misuse because it's stigma associated with it. So he was actually an alcohol associated liver disease patient and with deep jaundice. And he was actually going to die within a few months if they did not get a new liver. I did not bother asking the family about their deep into their financial status. I just told the wife, she had two small children. I mean, they had two small children and I told them that, you know, without a transplant, he's going to die for them. That's that that is the point that strikes, you know, you need a transplant. Only a transplant can save that man. And I did not know how this was done. But what happened was that they actually had no money at all. So they took a bank loan and there was a little bit of land that they had. This man had saved up and they actually put that land as mortgage for the bank, for the loan. And they did the transplant and the transplant. And he was so sick during the transplant because they took a long time to get that money, everything done. And by the time this patient was so sick and ideally, I told them that, you know, this time that we decided to do a transplant earlier and the time for transplant now, that's a lot of difference. You know, the benefits are going to come going to be less. But they said, so we tried so much. We have come this far. We want to do the transplant. So they did the transplant. It was somewhere around 18 to 19 lakhs at the time. And he was doing fine for the first one week. From second week onwards, he started getting infections because he was already having so many infections before transplant. That is a very high risk factor for infections after transplant. And the infections that he actually got after transplants were quite bad because you actually see a lot of weird and strange organisms infecting an immunosuppressed individual. And it was fungus infection and he died. And post-transplant for us to actually keep him alive for about a couple of weeks, they had to spend another four to five lakhs. And by the time everything was done, he died. They took his body and a couple of weeks or maybe three weeks later, one of the neighbors came back for some documents from me. So I said, how are they doing? How's the wife and kids doing? They said, sir, the whole family is now completely in a mess because they borrowed so much of money. And this patient died and they actually overshot the bank loan. They lost the land. And that land was actually the only thing the father had kept for the two female, I mean, the girl, the girl children. It's all lost there. And I think, I mean, he told me that, you know, they actually moved to their parents or grandparents someplace and they're trying to make ends meet there. And this was like a shocker to me because I did not know that there is this aspect of treatment. From that time onwards, every time I have to decide on an advanced treatment option for the patient, I look at the family. I look at the family status. I talk to them in depth about everything. How many children, how, how, how are they studying? What is your financial status? What about their education? I look at everything together and I make a calculation in my mind that, you know, if these patients, if I take them for a surgery, advise them for an advanced procedure like a transplant or something else, and if they can't afford it, and if they overshoot it, if that is going to affect them as a family after this man, I mean, you have, you can't guarantee anybody's life after procedure. I mean, you have that few risks here and there. Somebody can die. Some patients can actually have complications that you don't even expect to happen. So if I feel that, you know, they cannot afford and they're actually going to do something out of something that, that is going to stress them out for that financial aspect, I tell them, don't do it. Because see, whatever we can do, we'll do it medically. If you are comfortable with getting finances, and if you're comfortable getting finances that you live in, take care of complications, then yes, let us do it. Because otherwise you will lose the patient and you will lose your life. You will lose the future of your children. You will lose your land, you will lose your house, you will lose everything. It should not be like that. So make sure that financial stability is there. Make sure they can afford it. Otherwise take them through the journey where ultimately the patient might die. But then they will have that, that, that feeling that they have done everything medically for that patient. And we have also done everything medically for that patient. But ultimately we could not do much, but there is no financial burden on them. And there is no extra stress on that family. So once I started doing this for my patients, I found out that they were more satisfied with that kind of treatment rather than me telling them, do this, do that, do this, like exactly what you said. You are sitting there and giving orders, not thinking about things other than that particular organ. Like for example, if I just think about the liver and saving the liver, it's always a transplant. You know, I just keep pushing patients for transplant, make sure, I mean, I don't care about how they're going to do it. They will do it somehow. It's good money for the hospital. They'll let them do it. And because I want the transplants to be done, that is medically what is right. No, you cannot think like that as a doctor. You actually have to think beyond that. If the transplant is going to get them into a trouble, much more than that they bargained for with just the disease. I think it's, it's always good to openly discuss this with the family and the bystander and say that, you know, this is, these are the risks. You're going to be financially struggling after this. If something happens, if you want to take that risk, please do. Some of them say, yes, sir, we will do that. We will take that risk. Financially, if whatever happens, we have to sell our land, we have to sell our homes. We don't mind, we'll do it. And for such patient, I say, okay, fine. That's your decision. Others will actually come and tell me that, sir, because you have told us this, we do not know how to do it. And if we do this, we know we are going to get into a lot of trouble. And we know that this patient can also have a lot of complications. He might die also without doing it, but then there is no way that we can do it. And because you told us this openly, we can make the decision clearly. So if I don't talk to them about that particular aspect that, you know, it is okay to not take the best option, which is given to you because you cannot afford it. It is okay. It is fine. It's not like you have to do a transplant, spend that much amount of money to save that patient for you to have some success. It's not like that. Sometimes the best decisions may not be the best decision, best option for the patient, but it's definitely the best decision in the interest of the patient and the family. And this is what I have been doing in the last many, many years. And actually my patients have been actually doing quite well with that. And a lot of my patients have been improving also medically. Because what happens is that some doctors will say that, you know, do a transplant. They'll say that, sir, we cannot afford a transplant. So for that doctor, that's the end of it. So this guy is not going to do a transplant. So he's going to die. So just, you know, treat him like that. Give him something here and there. Anyway, he's going to die. So they don't actually bother treating them to their best efforts. This guy's anyway going to die. They know it. I know it. So why bother? But when you actually say that, you know, all of us know that he is going to die because they cannot afford the best option, it makes you do much more for the patient medically. And when that medical effort comes in really at that particular really good level, that actually improves the patient also better. So somebody who's going to die without a transplant in six months have seen them survive for more than two and a half to three years on medical management alone. So that extra three years for that family is like, it's a great thing. It's a great thing. So some patients tell me that, sir, you told us that without a transplant, he's going to die in six months. But medically, you have given us another two and a half years. That is enough for us. So that is where this aspect of what I studied in Calcutta was extrapolated"

        "message": "That original case, I mean, if I look back, see, I have a lot of regrets in during my initial part of my profession, because I was just a young graduate. I mean, I just got out of hepatology and I never knew what real life is going to be because I was always under the umbrella of my institute. So we have professors, associate professors, they make decisions. We just have to listen to what they want us to do. That's it. And you're not responsible. The whole institute is responsible. So we don't get into trouble. But when you practice alone, your responsibility is much, much different from the responsibility that you actually face in your training. And in that sense, I have a lot of regrets. And one of that is that sometimes I overdo a lot of things for my patients initially, a lot of things I used to overdo because I was scared. As a doctor, initially, I was not very good on confidence. And I was I used to do a lot of things for my patients from both investigation point of view and medical treatment point of view, thinking that something will hit somewhere. And if somebody comes and accuses me, so initially, the kind of practice that I used to do was to save myself, you know, not the patient. I'll do everything that I can. And I'll say that if the patient dies, I'll say that, you know, I've done everything. I actually done things that I should not have even done. So that was the kind of practice that initially I did. And that is that is why even the transplant happened, because I wanted them to do the transplant and they did the transplant. But then I would also want to blame them because it was their decision. They did the transplant and they knew that the patient can also die with the transplant. So it's basically like gaslighting. And I used to gaslight my patients initially and it was it was bad. And I learned from it because when I when my when when this patient actually was a very young man, I still remember his face. And when he died and I knew that they lost a lot of money, they lost everything that actually changed the way I actually practice medicine. So if I wanted to change anything for that particular patient, I would not have let them do the transplant. I would have actually done more for him medically instead of just pushing them into transplant and making them waste their money. I would have actually told them that, you know, we'll try medically as much as possible, which is low on finances for you, but maybe very good on the patient because medical management is not an inferior management. When you look at transplant, some patients do do well. And that would have actually, I think, probably given them another maybe two years. But instead of that, he died in six months. It was exactly the opposite what I had planned for them. So he died earlier than we expected him to. And he died in a way. I mean, he died increasing the financial burden on that family, the debt burden on that family. So I would not have transplanted him in the state that he was actually going in for transplant. I would have actually told them not to do it because I would I would know I now know that taking a patient like that for a transplant is a very high risk transplant. And there is no need to take that risk because every risk is associated with financial burden. Also, if they had a medical claim or medical insurance, fine, it's fine. They can do it, but not not like this, not putting everything else into trouble. Right. So that I would have done definitely different. And I don't think I have done a single I've made a single wrong decision. I mean, is what I feel. I have not because this is what I get. I mean, I get feedbacks from my patients and families also, even the ones who die, the ones who survive. I do get feedbacks from everyone. And what I feel is that I've been doing right by them. You know, I may not be able to save a lot of my patients without a transplant, but ultimately we are all on the same page and people are happy. Patients are happy. The families are happy when I tell them black and white that, you know, I'm sorry, but I feel that this is not going to work out and this is going to end up badly for you. And I don't want that to happen to you, even though this is going to end up badly for the patient, you know, it, we had to compromise somewhere. You either compromise on your future stability or you compromise on your patient right now, that is up to you. And when that openness happens from doctor's point, when, from the doctor's side, I think patients actually love that from doctors. The problem comes when doctors are not so open because see, I have fears. I have, I have doubts. And when I tell about my fears and my doubts to my patients and their family, we are all on the same page. And that is when patients and families, they don't get violent towards you. I've had two episodes of violence against me from patient families. But other than that, in my last seven years, never, ever, ever have I faced a bad episode from a patient family because I've been very open to them. And the two violence, I think maybe we can talk about it later on. The two violent episodes that I faced actually was because of poor communication. And I completely blame myself for that and not the patient."

So what I do is that whatever decisions that we make in the open or whatever things that I want to tell them openly, I don't do that much with the patient. I want my patient to be happy. So a lot of the complex decisions that I take is only with the family. And we don't have to tell the patient everything, you know, I mean, he does not need to know that he's going to die in six months. It's absolutely wasted information for him. Why should somebody know that they're going to die? Absolutely not needed. So what we do is that the families, of course, families, I mean, there are, in my clinical practice, what I have found out is that within the family, there is an alpha, you know, it can be the wife, it can be the mother, it could be a nephew, it can be a cousin, could be the daughter. But there is an alpha personality who actually understands and imbibes everything and helps others take decisions. So I always look out for the alpha when I talk because when I make when I discuss in depth, I don't discuss with one person. No, I don't say that, call the wife and just talk to the wife. I'll call the wife, she'll come with her sister, the mother. So there'll be a group of people who I talk to. It makes things easier for everybody to, you know, it's supportive for them also. I never separately call the patient's bystander and say that, you know, he's going to die and these things, we have to make a decision. I never do that. That's like harassment. It's like torture for them. So it's always in a group. So I always look at who the alpha is because when I talk to them in a group, there'll be one person who will be asking me a lot of questions to make a decision. And when that happens, what they do is they, as a group, they try to diffuse that tension within themselves. And ultimately, it's difficult for them to come to terms. I mean, I understand that. I mean, I cannot actually imagine. I mean, if you put me in that patient's wife or family's position, I don't know what I will be, what my thinking will be. It's not going to be easy. But what they do is they ultimately make a decision in such a way that it is not a single person making the decision. So that is the importance of talking to a group of people in the family. So it'll be a collective decision. And once that happens, a single person does not feel guilty. And it's a collective decision. Everybody is on board. It's a family. We are all on the same page. And the patient does not need to know about all of that. So what we tell the patient is that, see, we have made a collective decision for you. And this is what we are going to do. We are going to try medical management for you at the highest level possible. Keep your hopes up. We are keeping our hopes up. We'll hope everything goes well. We give him a good life. We take him on that journey. I mean, it is towards his death, but we make sure that journey is worth it for him. And I think this works out well. So when you have a happy patient, and then you have a collective decision making within the family, I don't think there is"

For example, I don't tell them that, you know, actually, we decided that, you know, we'll go with medicine because you don't have much money. And ultimately, without a transfer, you're going to die. No, it's not like that. He'll ask me directly, but I will diffuse the situation and provide him with more compassionate and caring words. And he'll forget about the actual question. So I confuse a lot of my patients like that when they ask me directly. But there are patients who are very adamant who wants to know what is going to happen to them. For example, patients with cancers, liver cancers, because they know it's liver cancer, and they really want to know what is going to happen to them. So I tell them, so I tell them from an evidence point of view. So we have a lot of these studies on liver cancer, we have stages of liver cancer, we actually know how much how long a patient is going to survive at each stage. And I show him the statistics. And I tell him that, see, these are statistics. And I tell examples from my own personal treatment choices that I made for my patients. I tell them, let's see, there is this patient who had exactly your stage of cancer. And I told him that, you know, he'll survive for only two months, but he survived for two years. There was another guy who I said will survive for two years, but then he survived for only two days. So we are not going to talk about when you're going to die, because I'm not God.

But even then, if you're dealing with cases like this all the time, I don't know how I would sleep at night because at some level, you're going to feel a connection for these people. You know, at some level, you're going to feel bad when someone goes at some level, it can't be nice that somebody's come for a particular visit and they're looking a particular way. And the next time they come, it's visible the deterioration you kind of you can. So how do you deal with that at an emotional level?"

But when I say a good sleep, it's not like, you know, I sleep deeply without any thoughts about my patients. I do think about them, especially patients who are, you know, patients who are fighting chance to survive. And we have to give them, we have to take that fight to them. Those are the patients who make me actually lose my sleep at night. And I keep thinking about them. But even then, if you ask me, that is actually a good quality sleep for me because I'm not wasting any time there sleeping. I'm lying down and I'm thinking about what to do for that person next day. And if that works out well, I'm happy. I mean, two hours of sleep, I get one hour of planning that I did and that worked out for that patient. That's good quality sleep for me.

I think the last few months, there is no good exercise. I mean, even though I've started hitting the gym in the last one month. So if I mean, that is what you said is perfectly true. And I think doctors are the ones who are the most unhealthy among the lot. I would say that actually by quoting a study, which the Indian Medical Association did in Kerala, where they found out that when you compare doctor population to general population, doctors died 10 years before general population. Wow. Yeah, a decade before. So somebody has a life expectancy of about 72. If you look at from the doctor's population in that same with the same characteristics, doctors are dying at 62. So this is very true. Doctors die much younger because of a lot of factors and definitely sleep and even the food patterns. And I have two meals a day. I have an early breakfast and an early dinner. And I drink loads of coffee in between. That is the only thing that I have in between. But if you look at from common man's or a layperson's perspective, that's really unhealthy eating habit, you know, but I'm going on with that. And it's been there for a long, long time. So I've got adjusted to it. My body's got adjusted to it. So it's very difficult. I mean, a doctor's life, I don't think if somebody asked me, I mean, right out there, I mean, if they don't have a good family presence of doctors, and they have some support to become a doctor, and if somebody right off the bat is interested in going for medicine, I would discourage them. If you ask me, I would discourage them because either you have to be compassionate and you have to be like a burning candle. You know, your whole life is going to be like that. You have to just keep burning and you will melt and go away. That is how it is going to be for you. It's not going to be all floral. It's going to be a tough life. So if you want that kind of life, yes, be a doctor. But otherwise, I don't think this is a profession that you should actually jumpstart from a fresh perspective. It's tough."

My father took me after my 12th grade when I did not get through. There were a few months we had, I was free from studies. He took me to, I think, Delhi for some medical conference, gastroenterology conference to help me get a feel of what a gastroenterology conference is. So I went there and then he introduced me to this elderly man and he said, what are you planning to do? I said, I'm trying for my MBBS. I'm going to start my coaching. Then he just told me, young man, this is the biggest mistake you're going to do in your life. Don't do it. I just looked at my dad. My dad is like poker faced.

Where you try to figure out their circumstances, their mentality to the extent that within a family, you're looking for an alpha and so on and so forth. And therefore, you have to give them time. Therefore, it seems that you cannot then have a cookie cutter approach to the thing. Whereas what we find in modern medicine, what many people including doctors often complain about is that they don't have a choice that you know, you have to maximize for the number of patients you see because there is so much pressure and therefore you minimize on the time that you give them. And therefore, you're basically using what economists would call fast and frugal heuristics with each patient where you're not really going deep. You're kind of whatever patterns you discern based on that you're saying, okay, take this medicine, take this test and all of that. And that's not necessarily a bad approach in the sense that you're seeing more people and therefore helping more people, but giving them less time and therefore the quality of the treatment suffers because of that. And somewhere in the middle, there is some line which is perfection. But basically, as a doctor, you constantly then have to deal with the trade off that either the quality for each patient will be good, but you'll see less patients or the other way around. So is this sort of a fair characterization and would it also be fair to say that the natural rational tendency for a doctor is to see as many people as possible because that's how you make the most money?"

        "message": "I mean, in our community, I mean, if you look at India, I mean, the whole country, like you said, there are there are these two kinds of doctors. One is the doctors who are seeing a lot of patients, but just superficially scratching the surface. And the second is doctors who actually see very few patients, but they see them thoroughly. They may not be able to accommodate every patient in need at that time. The whole point is that if you look at India per se, a lot of good quality medical, you know, work is done in the private sector. You know, if you look at liver transplants in Kerala, only the private hospitals do it, not a single government hospital does it. So when the quality of work is actually more in the private sector, what happens is that patients actually rush more into the private sector. It's not like government hospitals don't have patients. They do have patients, a lot of patients. But the problem is that if they want a different level of treatment, they all rush into the private sector. So doctors are actually completely stressed with this huge patient load in hospitals. And doctors can't take a decision on how many patients they're going to see because it's not their hospital. Somebody else is running it. So this is the corporate thinking that you have to actually maximize on the patient load. And these doctors are made to see. So I don't think any doctor wants to actually see 100 patients a day because it's tiring for them. I don't. I see 25 patients a day and I have fixed it. I am talking from a privileged position because even though I work at Rajagiri Hospital, it is our consultancy group that is giving the service. So we are just affiliated to Rajagiri, they don't employ us. So we can make our rules. So what we have done is my dad wants to see 100 patients, otherwise he'll go into withdrawal. He's that kind of a person. So he sees 100 patients, he'll see the first patient and the 100th patient the same way with the same energy. He does that because he knows how to do that. Me, on the other hand, if I see a 26th or a 28th patient, I'm half dead. My fuel is out, my battery is out by 4.35 o'clock. I can't see more than that. But I'm drained out because I spend a lot of time with these patients. So somebody sees 200 patients and me seeing 25 patients is actually equal when it comes to the energy spent on it. But every doctor cannot be like me in the sense that they cannot make decisions like me and they work in setups. For example, in a government hospital, you have to see every patient that comes to you. You cannot say, no, I'm not going to see that patient. You have to see it's part of the whole job profile. So I think doctors are not rationally made to actually see many patients and maximize on it. I think doctors really want to take it easy and see patients to their heart's content. But that is not happening here because of multiple factors. One is the patient burden, the doctor to patient ratio, the kind of services that is available in the public and private sectors, and also the demand from the patient community. For example, I see a lot of patients come to the hospital unnecessarily. They don't need to come to the hospital. Some of them just come because they're over-concerned. A lot of them have various other problems and it's not like they really need treatment. They just need a little bit of counseling and they're all fine. So I think if you can, if people are actually informed a little more about when to actually go to a hospital, get proper treatment and checkups done, that level of burden actually on the doctors can also reduce. For example, I'll tell you a classical example where I had this patient from this place called Malappuram. It's North Kerala, a huge Muslim population area. And he came to me because his brother was having cirrhosis. Actually, his cousin brother. So they're all the same family. So his cousin brother has cirrhosis. So he came to me and asked me that you please check me up. I think I have cirrhosis. He has no problems, no symptoms, nothing. He just came to me and said, OK, let us check. And he came. I did an ultrasound. I did some specific tests for him and he actually did have cirrhosis. So he had chronic liver disease, but he was OK because he was very obese and he had a diabetes that was undiagnosed. So we diagnosed it. We diagnosed liver disease and fat liver disease, everything. And then I gave him all the treatments and I sent him home. The next few days, you won't believe the whole family, about 28 to 29 of them landed up on the OPD doorstep for health evaluation and none of them had any problem. So that that that is a huge burden on on my practice because they're all OK. They're fine because this guy had an unexpected cirrhosis diagnosis and his brother already had cirrhosis. They were all I mean, people are health conscious, obviously, but that that kind of that kind of approach and attitude towards health care services is very much predominant in our country because people want to get checked up even if even if they don't have any issues, they just want to visit a doctor and increase the patient burden in the hospitals. So I think that is one small aspect of, you know, increased work from the from a doctor's point of view. And also because, you know, doctors are not owners of the hospital and their job profile warrants them to see more patients. And that is classical corporate tactics. You see more patients, it's more business for the hospital."

And a lot of that is happening because a lot of people are going out of the country. So if you if I look at my batch, MBBS batch, I think just a handful of us are here in India. Majority of them are in the US and UK. And because of which a lot, I mean, even after this neat PG fiasco and everything is happening, a lot of students are going out of the country. And I think not just limited seats that are available. So the MBBS seats have been increasing, but the MD and DM seats are not fully increasing. So you have a huge number of doctors who are trained at the basic level only. You don't have doctors above that. You don't have specialists and super specialists. And they are the ones who will actually cater to quality patients at some point. And that is not happening. And because of that, we have stagnant doctors who are who can, you know, see patients, manage them superficially, but they're not going to cater to the real needs of a patient. And that is actually causing a lot of trouble. So definitely, we have a problem with doctor patient ratio, even if even though the government would not, I think, because the last time the government actually brought out a statistic and said that now we have reached the WHO level of definition of good doctor to patient ratio, they actually include all the Ayush practitioners also in that."

        "message": "Yeah. So within medicine, like you said, I mean, when do we actually decide on what we want to do within medicine? Right. So I think that actually comes up comes in internship. So you finish your MBBS training, and then you have a compulsory one year internship rotation in all the departments, you know, and you have you can actually have internship rotations in specific optional areas also, like, for example, forensic medicine, somebody likes forensic medicine, they can opt for that for an internship rotation there. So in internship, what I found out was that from my own personal perspective, is that I did not like any of the surgical subjects, you know, long time standing, you know, it was so stressful surgery, when you look at being a physician, and I immediately lost my interest in surgery. I mean, I did not like general surgery, I did not like transplant surgery. At that time, I was posted in in a kidney transplant unit. And it was so so scary, because of the surgery takes many, many hours. And after the surgery, the surgeon has to rest. So he goes home, and then he puts me in in the with the patient to monitor the patient. And every time I have to see how much of urine is coming out, because they have put in a new kidney. And the most important aspect is that the urine should come out properly. So every hour I'll sit there and look at the urine, how much ML is coming and I message him this much ML has come. So I found that that was it's too stressful for me, the surgical, the surgical part. And so I fell in love with the medical part. And in within medicine, I liked to work with adult medicine, instead of pediatrics, because in pediatrics, it's kind of it's I mean, I mean, I don't know how best to put it, but it's kind of like, like in veterinary medicine, you know, the dogs, the cats, they don't, they can't tell you their complaints. Same with these little kids, they just either cry, or they don't. It's so scary. There is nothing in between either they cry, or they're like, flabby, and they don't they don't respond. And, and you have to figure out what the hell is happening to them. And all you have other parents, and the parents are so stressed out there. I mean, I must give it to pediatricians. I mean, I have, I just salute them, pediatricians and neonatologist, the ones with which who work with the littlest neonates and, and other children. I mean, I don't know how they do it, because I can't, it's too much. And because of that, I wanted more interaction with my patients and their family, I fell in love with the adult medicine part. And in adult medicine, the what I found out was that you need to have variety, you know, and that's that's how, you know, dermatology and psychiatry and everything went off, because it's, it's, it's more focused into a particular aspect. So general medicine was the best option for me, because in medicine, you see everything, you know, you see psychiatric patients, you see dermatology, you see stroke, you see cardiac, everything you see, you have the whole bunch mixed back there. So it's very, very exciting and very interesting, challenging too, because you'll not know what you're going to see next day. So it's always exciting to work. So that is why I took internal medicine. And once I finished internal medicine, then the rest of the decisions on as to which is the best for me or which particular aspect of medicine I will, I will appreciate all my life. That was not singularly my decision. Like I said, it was a lot to do with my father's advice also, because he wanted me to do something more than just being a doctor nine to five. So he was like, he's like a nine to five doctor, he goes and sees maximum number of patients, spends time with them and he's fine with that. But he knew that there was another part of me where I wanted to do or understand new things about my patients. And that is where clinical research comes in. So that is why exactly why he wanted me to and get a get a feel of hepatology. And that is how I understood the importance of hepatology and its practice because I found out that I loved adult medicine, I loved internal medicine, hepatology is the most extreme form of internal medicine. And plus it has a lot of clinical research opportunities. This is how I, I went into hepatology in that sense. But I have had a lot of my friends who actually enter into one particular stream, for example, they do general surgery and they've actually dropped it because they could not go on with it and then tried for another. And many of them, there are a lot of them who actually completely dropped becoming clinical doctors that is after BBS or right through MD and MS, they have stopped studying or stopped that particular training and they have gone and done MBA and hospital administration and gone into entrepreneurship and things like that. There are there are a lot of my friends who do that. So I think it's it's not easy. It's not like black and white, which everybody can say that, you know, I want this at some point. I think it's a process. So you have to journey through that phase, like MBBS, absolute confusion. What is happening? MD, you understand that now you actually are a doctor, you know, after MBBS, you don't feel like a doctor. In MD, you actually feel like, yeah, I think I'm a doctor. And when it comes to DM, you'll say that, yeah, now I'm a doctor and I'm confidently I'm going to work for my patients. So I think everybody should go through that and ultimately decide there will be a point where you it strikes you that, you know, this is what I like. There are very few people who actually say that, you know, this is what I want, because they have a lot of that kind of, for example, I know a person whose family is full of cardiologists. So he has his brother as a cardiologist, his brother-in-law is a cardiologist, he's a cardiologist, his dad is a cardiologist, his mom is a cardiologist. So they do cardiology. So that I mean, there are there are there are families like that. So that that decision already made, it'll never go away. But for me, and I think for the for a person who starts off with medicine as a career, I think the journey will take the person to the destination. And nothing is predetermined."

And community medicine is where you actually learn statistics in MBBS. And that is a chapter which nobody bothers about. And if I find a I mean, when in my MBBS exams, when I find a statistic question, I just leave it. Because I know I can make it up in some other question. I don't want to bother about statistics. But what I found out is that if you are going to be a clinical researcher, a large part of research is on analysis, you have to analyze data. Without analyzing the data, you have no results and no outputs and you have no conclusions to your study. And analysis is purely statistics. And it was not like before. Now we have very good softwares that actually help you do analysis so easy from scratch. You don't actually have to sit and study statistics, you just need to know how to operate the software. And which particular statistic to apply at which point, for example, if you're doing two group analysis or a single group analysis, you have specific sets of analytical scores that you should apply, and you just need to know that. So it's very easy. But even that people are not interested in, but they should be if they actually want to take up a career as a clinician scientist. So there are clinicians who will purely work on the ground like doctors nine to five, there are scientists who have no exposure to patients, but they will work with data only, and bring out basic science work. And there are clinician scientists, which is actually a very rare breed, which my sir is Professor Shiv sir is a clinician scientist, and he trained me to be one. And I think every doctor should strive to be a clinician scientist. And to become a good clinician scientist, you have to know statistics, there is no other way. And what I say is why I say that is see there is there are two ways to it. If you're working in a big university, you'll have a statistician there, he'll help you out. But problem is that you have something in your mind that you want to do for your patients or analyze. And it's not going to be so easy for you to make that person understand what you want. But if you know statistics, it's so easy for you, it's it won't waste your time, you can directly jump into it and get your results done. So you will be like self it's like a self contained unit, if you know statistics and clinical research becomes part of you. So that is why I say statistics is, is very important. And coming to that second part of the question, out of medicine, I think everybody if you ask me, I mean, go back and ask me that what do you actually wanted to become that question never came. I would say that I wanted to, I actually wanted to become a screenwriter."

And out of my medicine, three things I love is that I love to travel on weekends hunting for new food places in and around Cochin. That is why you see a lot of new food photos every weekend. And the second thing is I love to catch up on some movies. And I don't see mainstream theater movies, I want to see some unique kind of movie. So I am a big fan of Korean movies. So that is something I love. I see a lot of Korean movies. And the third aspect is photography. So I'm not a professional photographer, but I love to take a picture of something good. And it's almost always food. And these three things actually keep me alive out of medicine. And obviously, this is all with family. So that gives it extra sweetness. You cook also? No, I don't cook. But I think I used to love cooking. But I don't cook. But if you give me an opportunity, I'll definitely cook. But my wife doesn't give me that because she wants everything to be done by her style. And I love it because her food is like the best. So I let her cook."

And I would expect that if I sit in as a talk of his, I'm not going to understand anything because he's such a big person and he knows so much about basic stuff. But if you actually sit in his talk, he'll tell you stuff like you're going to read Amar Chitra Katha. It is going to be that simple. He can simplify such complex matters because he knows basic science stuff. And that is exactly what he's taught me also. And that is exactly why I am able to talk about diseases, management and prognosis in very simplified terms to my patients and their family. I don't use any medical terms when I talk to them at all. And I make it a point that I don't use any medical terms, no scientific jargons. And without using medical terms and scientific jargons, my patients understand the same level of stuff that I understand about the disease equally. So if I know something about alcoholic liver disease to the highest extent, the same thing my patient will also know. I make sure we are all on the same page and he will know because I have simplified it for him and why could I simplify that because I love the basic science part of it. And this is the only way you can simplify medicine for patients if you know basic science."

They'll say, OK, fine, and they'll just go. But if you actually start telling them nicely, they'll sit and hear you out and ask you questions. So this is one of my litmus test. So if a patient listens to me or a family listens to me and they have a lot of questions for me, that means it's worked. That means they want to know more about it and they're getting a feel of it. They understand what I'm trying to tell them. But if I say something and they just look at me blankly and they just get up and go, that means I have failed. And a lot of patients who actually come to me for second opinion, come to me because of this. They just want to know what they have.

But they don't, after that it's a daily grind and they're not really keeping themselves up to date as much as they should, which is a problem because, A, the science is changing in many fields like nutrition, for example, where the conventional wisdom of the 90s is like almost the opposite of today. And B, you know, when something new comes about like Covid, your traditional knowledge, you know, you have to all stay on top of it, look at the latest research, look at the latest numbers and use your, you know, statistical mind there as well. So when you look around you at the profession, I mean, you've written 165 papers, obviously, to make an effort to keep in touch.

        "message": "don't do this? I think a majority of doctors don't do this. They don't read, they apply what they have been taught, and they just follow the guidelines. And some of them actually don't even follow the updated guidelines. So that's that's even worse. What I do is that I read every day an hour, I spend one hour on I mean, because we have so many journals, and every journal has different different contents. I mean, in hepatology itself, we have multiple journals, and every journal will have some good content in it. It's not going to be easy for you to, you know, read every journal towards the weekend. So what I do is I target I take one journal a day, go through the latest additions on the in their online new issue. And I read one paper from that every day. If I don't find anything interesting, and that that day is free for me, I don't do anything, but I still look for new data every day. And I have trained myself to do that. And which is why I can help. I mean, I can get updated much faster and easier, instead of waiting for somebody to update me. Another way of getting updated is to attend conferences, and that to really good academic conferences. For example, I'm yet to actually see a very good academic conference in India, because in India, medical conferences are, it's like a Bollywood song. It's just you know, people partying and all that. And I mean, if you look at conferences from the liver societies that is done from outside from Europe and in the US, they just they just stick to academic work, they just want to get updated and they they provide and produce the latest stuff there. And I always I mean, before the COVID came every year, I used to go for the American the liver meeting, and the International Liver Congress, that is the Europe one, and get myself updated there. But it's not easy to travel now every year. So I have started doing this journal reading stuff now. But what doctors who cannot do that can do is to attend such academic conferences, because that's like one short updation for everything. And you have annual conferences, maybe once or twice for some institutes, I mean, for some societies, they have double conferences, and all I mean, specific single topic conferences and annual conferences, which gets you very good updated data. But doctors don't even do that. You know, they go for conferences to have a good time. If you actually see Indian comics so funny, they'll, you'll have academic sessions going on, but there'll be some boat cruise and some dance happening. People are all there, nobody's in the in the hall. And I think that that kind of environment within the Indian academia must change, you know, you don't have to make all conferences very Bollywood style, you can actually focus on good academic input so that people actually get good academic outputs for their patients. And that is what we should strive for. And the third aspect is that doctors actually they overwork. I mean, like I said, somebody who sees 120 patients a day, I don't think he has he has any energy left to come and read. And people work here on Saturdays also. And Saturday is just like any other weekday for a lot of doctors. They see patients from nine to five, come home at seven or eight. And Sunday is just the one day and I don't think any doctor is going to sit and read on a Sunday because they've been working from Monday to Saturday. So I think the work profile also matters regarding the updation part. A lot of general practitioners and super specialists, they're all working day in and day out. So they forget to update themselves. And I see that some of them do update themselves when they actually are faced with a crisis. So you have a patient who actually is challenging you with a diagnosis or a management, then I think many doctors go back and read and see what they can do for that. So there are doctors who update from that point of view also. For example, in my practice also, when I started seeing a lot of different types of causes for acute hepatitis, I went back and started reading differently on those issues. So that kind of updation can also happen, which is case by case based. But otherwise, a protocol based, daily based updation, for updation sake, I don't think"

        "message": "I think classical example, I think the most classical example is that I had, I mean, if you look at, I tweeted about this and I had a lot of backlash. So I had a tweet which went really viral. I had like 6k likes on it and I tweeted a few points and one of the point in that was that tweet had multiple points and one of the point was that cirrhosis is reversible. It can be reversed. So I just mentioned that. A lot of doctors actually wrote as a response under that saying that what nonsense are you speaking? Go open your textbooks and see what is the definition of cirrhosis. The definition of cirrhosis is a structural change to the liver, that is structural means both vascular, that is your blood vessel count part and the liver mass. Changes happen structurally which cannot be reversed. That is what is written in the textbook. An irreversible change to the structural aspect of the liver is cirrhosis. So they are saying that definition is this and you are saying cirrhosis can be reversed. What nonsense is this? So that is the problem with not getting updated. So what happened was that initially when we used to talk to patients, when I used to talk to patients initially about cirrhosis and they asked me, sir can this get cured, doctor can this get cured? And I said cirrhosis cannot be cured, you know you can actually arrest it at a particular stable stage and that's about it. Some people progress and once they progress you will end up with a transplant at some point which is actually for a patient if you hear that it's quite depressing. What happened was that there was this study when I came across, there is a study, I mean fibrosis is a process where your liver gets scarred, I mean medically speaking fibrosis is when your liver is scarred and once that fibrosis progresses at the stage 4 of fibrosis is when your liver becomes cirrhotic. So that is when it becomes irreversible actually. Fibrosis can also happen in the lung that is known as pulmonary fibrosis. So there was a study where doctors, I mean pulmonologists actually used a particular molecule known as spurfinidone and they actually treated pulmonary fibrosis and saw that the fibrosis was reversing. Basically the drug dissolved the scars and the lungs were improving structurally. So I said the fibrosis process in the lung, if you look at the basic science part of it, molecular level is the same that happens in the liver. The same kind of chemicals and the same kind of enzymatic reactions and everything is happening in the liver also. So the fibrosis part is equal. So what if this molecule, if I give it to a cirrhosis patient, will it reverse cirrhosis? So what we did was we did a small pilot trial and I asked 3 patients if they are willing, if they would give me consent to start this particular molecule to see if cirrhosis gets reversed. And they were all fatty liver disease patients, obese with cirrhosis, stable cirrhosis, no other issue. So I did a biopsy first, proved that there is cirrhosis and I gave them this drug spurfinidone for 3 to 6 months. And I did a repeat biopsy and I saw that the cirrhosis actually was reversing in these patients with the use of this drug. So medically with a drug, you can reverse cirrhosis and this was proven. And we published this in the Journal of Clinical and Transnational Hepatology and the use of purfinidone as an agent to reverse cirrhosis. So that whole idea of cirrhosis cannot be reversed is out of the window now, traditionally thought is out of the window. Now when you go back and look at other, because liver disease is not because of a single cause, you can have multiple causes, for example, hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, these are all alcoholic liver disease can all cause cirrhosis. So when I look back at the literature, I saw that the same molecule was used by a group in South America and they treated hepatitis C patients and found out even their cirrhosis was getting reversed. The fibrosis was getting reversed. So we have more data on it. So I said, okay, this is something really new because nobody was talking about it. Then I found out that 25 years back, there was a paper written by this brilliant pathologist called Ian VanLess. Ian VanLess is one of the biggest names in liver pathology and in the liver histology we say, you know, you look under the microscope and see. So he was a great liver pathologist. So he has actually written a paper where he has mentioned that cirrhosis can regress provided you actually halt the cause of cirrhosis. For example, what he did was when he looked at patients who were on hepatitis B medications before and after, he found out that patients when they took hepatitis B medications for longer duration, the cirrhosis and the fibrosis scars were actually resolving with just hepatitis B management and patients who are on alcohol, when they stopped alcohol, their fibrosis was reversing. So he wrote a big paper at that time, which was like two decades back. And he mentioned that cirrhosis is reversible and it goes into something known as regression and new liver cells actually are regenerated in areas where the fibrosis and the scars get dissolved. So which means the traditional thinking of cirrhosis not getting resolved was there since two and a half decades before and people still don't realize that and they are still stuck with the dogma saying that cirrhosis is reversible. So this is something new that I could do for my patients. When I look back at the literature in the immediate and the past, this aspect of reversing cirrhosis was there initially, but now we have another molecule which we can actually use to reverse cirrhosis. So this is the important aspect of getting to know the basic science behind a particular disease."

        "message": "You can do new things for your patients. And you mentioned the word dogma and that reminds me of two things and one is of course a classic story of Ignaz Semmelweis, the doctor who realized in the middle of the 19th century that all you need to do to avoid the majority of infections in hospitals is wash your hands properly. And he was outcast from the profession. I think he spent time in an asylum or whatever, very sad life. But basically he was a complete outcast because people refused to buy that and countless lives were lost because no one paid attention to him. And similarly, so I was diagnosed with type two diabetes last year, very overweight, cholesterol, type two diabetes, all of that partly because, you know, sedentary lifestyle during COVID and I let it happen to myself. Now, intellectually, I knew what I kind of need to do to sort of reverse it because people used to say type two diabetes is irreversible. And I felt that the science now shows that that's not the case. And I initially I went to a doc, he gave me some medication. But in three, four months, I realized that that's not the way to go. I stopped the medication, decided to only focus on my diet, and I reversed it. Like my HbA1c was 7.7, now it's 5.7, right? It's through diet and lifestyle, basically keto plus intermittent fasting for diabetes. It's not a hammer that can be used for every nail as you pointed out on Twitter. But for that, and again, you know, to just to mention this, you get dogmatic resistance from people whose conception of medicine is somewhat older. They're like, no, you can only manage diabetes, you can't reverse it, and so on and so forth. And I'll be giving them books and trying to explain and giving links to research and saying, no, read this paper, read that paper. How dangerous is how dangerous is this kind of dogma? Because I think a lot of the medicines that 10 years ago would have been standard and say something like type two, actually don't do anything for the problem at all, they might even make it worse."

        "message": "That is true. I think this this kind of traditional beliefs, I mean, I'm talking about scientific, you know, traditional, older scientific traditional beliefs, where you actually say that, you know, cirrhosis cannot be reversed, or I mean, like, for example, diabetes cannot be reversed or controlled just with diet and things like that. It impacts the patient population, because the new information is always hopeful for the patient. For example, if I keep saying that cirrhosis is reversible, 10 years, 20 years down the lane, that is going to affect my patients negatively. But if I tell them that, you know, there are studies that say that this particular drug can reverse your cirrhosis. And there are studies which say that if you lose weight, or if you stop drinking, or if you take treatment for hepatitis B, your cirrhosis can get reversed. So they have something to look forward to, they have something to add on from their own point of view, instead of just prescription medicines. You know, medicine is not just about pushing pills into the patient, it's a lot of things. And I think getting to know something that is updated in a particular area, which we thought was redundant or stuck like that for life. It's like a fresh breath of air for both the doctor and the patient. So when that particular doctor actually, he was a nice guy, I mean, on Twitter, he initially came out a little bit of in the sense that like I was a clown, you know, he was joking with me saying that, you know, you what are you saying, you're actually going against what is the current belief in medical practice, are you calling yourself a scientist and things like that he was telling. Then I showed him the data in the DMs, I messaged him, I did not do it on this thing, I messaged him in the DM saying that my paper is this and this. He was like shell shocked. He was like, I never knew this stuff actually existed and you can actually reverse cirrhosis. And he is now a better doctor than before, because he's going to tell his patients and he's going to know, I mean, and his patients are going to know more about their disease conditions in a better way now. But there are other doctors who still won't take my or even open my research links. And they still keep talking, saying that, you know, I'm wrong. And cirrhosis is irreversible because it is written in a textbook. Textbooks are not everything, you know, you have journal entries, which are updated textbooks get updated every five or six years only. So it's not like the final word and everything. And those kind of doctors are actually harmful for the patient society. And I'll say this without any percussions, I mean, any regrets. I don't think such doctors deserve being doctors continuously like this. I mean, every doctor must strive and look for something new for their patients. And which is why I keep saying that, you know, a doctor should not be a doctor, should be a doctor scientist. And that actually helps the patient. Because when you are actually looking at the clinical research point of view, it makes you a better person from your patient's perspective, because you're always looking at something new for your patients. And this is exactly what happened when I started doing work on alcoholic liver disease. So we have a group of patients where they have severe alcoholic liver disease known as alcoholic hepatitis. And alcoholic hepatitis patients, if you look at the recommended treatment or approved treatment, there is none. There are no approved treatments for severe alcohol associated hepatitis. There is a recommended treatment, which is a short course of steroids that will reduce their jaundice and hepatitis, and it will give them benefit for one month only. Beyond one month, they're back to square one, a lot of them will require a liver transplant. So the only curative treatment is a liver transplant. Now the problem is that these patients are heavy drinkers. They're sick, and a liver transplantation may not be a good option to start with, because they can get infected. Like my first patient, he was actually an alcoholic hepatitis patient. And what happened was that when I looked at such patients, and Kerala is replete with alcoholic liver disease, because it's one of the states where there is maximum amount of drinking. I think we have about three or five times more drinking than the national average in Kerala. And alcoholic hepatitis is always a challenge to treat. So what happened was that a few years back, I think this was in 2015-2016, when I entered into DM, we are given the choice of, option of choosing our thesis topics. So I mean, every DM, super specialty course has one thesis topic. We had two. So we had to select two thesis topics. So when I, when my professor, Sarin told me to look at things out of the box, I was just looking at alcohol, hepatitis and things like that. And I got two papers from Europe, both the authors were women, one, her name is Lopez, Lopez and colleagues, and another lady from France, they did some work in animal models and showed that in the presence of alcohol. So what they did was they fed these small animals, I mean, you actually feed, there is a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease where you feed a mouse alcohol intermittently and they develop alcoholic liver disease and then you can study it. So they started feeding animals, small animals, a little bit of alcohol, and they found out that while the alcoholic hepatitis was developing in these animals, the change that they actually found out was that the bacteria inside their intestines were also changing. So the good bacteria became bad bacteria in the presence of alcohol and that bad bacteria and its functions and its metabolites and its products, that is what harmed the liver to cause alcoholic hepatitis. So what they did was they gave good bacteria to these animals and found out that the alcoholic liver disease actually reduced. So this is what later on became stool transplantation in my patients. So I took that basic science data and I applied it in humans. So what we did was we took about 8 to 10 severe alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis patients and we took healthy people, we took their stool, collected their stool, healthy people's stool and we processed the stool and we gave that stool through a tube to the alcoholic hepatitis patients. So this was known as a stool transplantation and I was the first to do it in the world in liver disease. You were the first to do it in the world? Yeah. Wow. So we did the first alcoholic stool transplantation in severe alcoholic liver disease in the world. And what we found out was that the patients who received a healthy stool, rich in good bacteria from healthy donors, their jaundice reduced, their hepatitis reduced, their alcoholic liver disease reversed and they came out of the transplant listing. So they never needed liver transplantation after that. So the stool transplantation protocol was born there as part of my thesis. So that is published in the official journal of American Gastroenterological Association known as Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2018. So we published that paper and from there onwards we started this work on modulating the intestinal bacteria to improve outcomes in alcoholic liver disease and I think we have published more than four to five original papers on that topic. And the American Gastroenterology Association has actually mentioned that in patients with severe alcoholic liver disease, if there are no options for medical treatment and they have no options for a liver transplant, this is a salvage option. So you can actually save them, prevent them from dying by giving stool transplantation. And this happened because we went back and looked at basic science."

Yeah. So what they used to do was they wanted to treat sick kids with dysentery or diarrhea. They used to give fresh stool samples from healthy kids, just put them in water and feed them. That was known as yellow soup at the time. And they used to directly consume the stool from healthy kids. And this is well documented in Chinese traditional Chinese literature."

So I think at some point they observed that if you actually, I mean, everything has to I mean, if you look at the principles that guide treatment long back, it's mostly everything was gut derived. So they say that, you know, the fire in your belly is not good or the fire is too much. So you have to extinguish the fire. I mean, these are the kind of treatments that used to matter, the humoral theory, things like that. So as part of that, I think a dysentery or a diarrhea sick child had some abnormal humors and fire in the belly. So to improve that, they gave good fire from the other kid, you know, maybe that is how they thought at that time. But now we know why it works because of the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria. And there is this surgeon. What he did was in 1950s. He was seeing a lot of patients post-surgery on antibiotics who are developing something known as pseudomembranous colitis, which is an opportunistic infection that happens in patients in the post-surgical period, critically ill patients in the ICU. So your large intestine gets infected by this particular bacteria known as Clostridium difficile. C. difficile is its name. And it causes torrential diarrhea and a lot of patients actually die with it because of that severe diarrhea and infection. Their large intestine gets completely ulcerated and destroyed. So what his name is Ben Iceman, the surgeon's name. So what Ben Iceman did was he took this idea from traditional Chinese medicine. And what he did was he took fresh stool samples from his, I mean, the family members made it into an enema and gave this fresh, good stool enema to these patients and found out that their diarrhea drastically reduced and their Clostridium difficile infection reduced and they survived. They did not die. And he published that. Now fast forward few decades, two to three decades later, a lot of work at the basic science level was happening on gut microbiota, which is basically the total name that we give for all the microorganisms in the gut. So when this work happened, they found out that, you know, patients with Clostridium difficile infection had a totally different kind of gut microbiota versus a healthy person. So they decided that, you know, there is this particular group of Clostridium difficile infection, which do not respond to medicines at all. So you give them antibiotics, they get worse, they don't improve. It comes back again and again. And those are the patients who die. So what they did was they did a randomized, I mean, this is like how we test a hypothesis, right? You do randomized control trials. So this young physician from Belgium, her name is Els Van Nood, she and her group did a randomized control trial and they gave one group of patients with recurrent severe C difficile infection, healthy stool through a tube put in the nose or through the endoscope into the small intestine, fresh stool samples with good bacteria, and another group they gave placebo, which is sham treatment. They actually stopped that trial halfway through before they actually reached the sample size because every person who received good stool showed immense improvement, rapid improvement from their symptoms and complete resolution of C difficile infection. And so the stool transplant actually was first approved by the FDA for recurrent C difficile infection. And later on, when other scientists started looking at liver disease patients, they found out that this gut microbiome thing works in liver disease also. And that is where those two other researchers found out that alcoholic liver disease can improve with good bacteria, which I applied first in humans."

And would it be fair to say that doctor student, a different hypothecation, doctor student, like if you're learning all your life, if you're making that effort, that's also important that all of us, regardless of what field we are in, should have that hunger for learning, because that's how we'll be the best at what we do."

I think what differentiate being a student from being a scientist is that the student will learn what is given to that, what is given to you. So you'll go read guidelines, you'll go read things like that. But a scientist will actually be more curious. So they will want to actually challenge the guidelines or think out of the box. So I think that is the difference between being a student and being a scientist. And every doctor should be a student because you have to read about new stuff, new treatment options, everything they'll have to do. For example, in liver diseases also, every day new new trials come, new new treatments come. For example, hepatitis C, a decade back, it was so difficult to treat, it was a painful treatment. You have to take multiple injections called interferon, lasting 24 to 48 weeks, severe side effects and everything. And then suddenly one day, direct acting antivirals came, DAA, which are just simple capsules. You pop in once or twice a day for three months and your virus is gone. So that kind of learning is there as a student and doctors know about it because nobody treats hepatitis C with those injections anymore. Every doctor treats with this particular capsule. But what is different is that how can you improve on these treatments? So that if you have a scientist mind, only you can do."

So when we talk about the traditional belief that moderate consumption of alcohol, especially wine, people say, or even spirits, proper hard liquor, about one or two drinks a day is going to be, is going to be good for you. It's good for your health, they say, everybody. But you have to define what it is good for, right? So studies have shown that it is good for only a particular condition, which is basically your coronary artery disease, your heart disease. A particular aspect in heart disease is what it is found to reduce. But the same amount or even the, even a lesser amount of that alcohol can actually promote 10, 20 other problems in you. So if you look at alcohol, yes, there may be some benefit that you've seen in studies, but the risk far outweigh the benefits. So when you look at something that is, when you say that something is going to be useful for you, it has to be from risk benefit ratio. Like for example, 10 people drive without a seatbelt and 10 people drive with seatbelt. And you look at the 10 people who drive without seatbelt, they get into a crash, eight of them died. And out of the other 10 who had a seatbelt, all of them survived. So if you look at the risk benefit ratio, wearing a seatbelt is always good. If it's just the opposite, like for example, if you have, I always say this to my patients, like if you, if you have a particular intervention, for example, in this situation, we're talking about alcohol, drinking alcohol. So if you have a particular intervention, if you have to look at everything that happens around that intervention, right, alcohol is not the only thing that we are not just looking at the heart, we're looking at the liver, we're looking at other organ systems also. And studies have actually shown that single exposure to alcohol in women, that is even one drink per day, or even up to three drinks or three to four drinks in a week, can actually substantially increase the chances of getting cancer, breast cancer. So are you going to protect your heart at the risk of getting breast cancer? I mean, that risk is still there. So that is why I say there is no safe level of alcohol, because you cannot call it safe, you can only call it safe, if it actually is going to have that single impact, which is going to protect your heart without any other issues. But it's not like that you have it will protect your heart. Yes, maybe in some studies, it has shown, but it will cause umpteen other problems around it. So that is why I say no alcohol level is safe."

And is it then the case that today, the alcohol lobby might be funding the publication of news pieces like this, which will, you know, cherry pick one sort of particular context in which alcohol may be good for you, but not talk about all of the others. So is that part of the case? Or is it just sloppy journalism?"

But I think a lot of it has to do with sloppy journalism, 100% like, for example, smoking. Smoking actually reduces your chances of getting Alzheimer's disease is great, right? But then it causes so much of the other cancers, you'll die of lung cancer before you get Alzheimer's. Exactly. Or you will, you will have enough to remember that you're dying of lung cancer, you know, you'll not lose your memory. That's even worse. And same same thing. If you look at there was a study on beer, and there is a study on wine. And very interestingly, there was a study that was published in Lancet, which actually said that if you if people who are above the age of 40, if they have moderate alcohol consumption, it actually improves their chances of getting reduces their chances of getting metabolic syndrome and other heart related problems. But if you drink, if you're drinking when you're below age of 40, it causes more trouble. So that distinction also they made. But the problem is that all of these studies are all observational. It's not like they're actually asking people to drink and then following them up. You cannot have a prospective trial on alcohol use. It's impossible. So these are all observational trials. And a lot of confounders are there. So for example, they might not have looked at other issues that are propping up in these patients, for example, cancers, how many of them develop cancers, how many of them developed other complications of alcohol use, I mean, none of these actually looked into that part is not spoken about. That is the problem with that study. Now when a journalist actually looks at that study, they will not talk about these issues. They will just talk about what the study conclusion is. If you are more than 40, drinking alcohol will help you. This is the biggest problem because as journalists, I think, I mean, especially as medical journalists, what they should do is to, they should know, learn how to critique that paper also. That is exactly what we do. So you can actually see that in a lot of these journals, they have a section known as letter to editor. So when the letters to editor are actually critiques of published papers, and it's brilliant, you can actually see a lot of strengths and weaknesses in those letters to editor. So every journalist who is going to report on a particular study, especially with controversial topics like alcoholism or smoking, I think they should first learn how to critique the paper and then give a balanced view from the paper point of view and the weaknesses also because good authors always mention the weaknesses of the study also. There will be a limitation section in that. But a lot of these journalists don't even bother reading that. They'll just read the abstract, I think, probably, and they will not include anything from the limitations part. But once that is done, there'll be clarity because the whole aspect of moderate alcohol is good for you, good for you is being continuously propagated over the decades through media and everything without actually talking about the limitations of the study or problems around it. People still believe that a little bit of alcohol is fine. Actually people get offended when I tell them to, you know, stop. I mean, not even stop, reduce."

So one of my friends, Prem Panekar, often talks about how one key aspect of the crisis in Indian media today is because of falling budgets and because of falling profitability, you have less and less journalists doing more and more work, which means those journalists are actually generalists. They don't know anything about any one subject. So they, you know, quite often in many newspapers, your person reporting on medicine and vaccines and all that will actually not have any understanding of medicine and it's not necessarily their fault. It's just their understanding that go and write a story and oh, you got to do two more stories today. So just kind of get it done. And there's a phrase I love called Gelman amnesia, like Michael Crichton coined it for his friend Murray Gelman and Gelman amnesia is that I'll read something in the newspaper on a subject I know something about, you know, and I'll be like, what shit is this? They don't know what they're talking about. But everything else in the newspaper, which I can't scrutinize myself, I will take it as gospel, right? And which is the amnesia that kind of happens. So do you see that with medical reporting? Like at one level, obviously, every medical reporter cannot know as much as a specialist like you. But at another level, there is a basic degree of understanding they should have and they should be responsible with their words.

But pro public health, if they keep that in mind, then they can actually give good information and they can stop with this disinformation that is going on. And a lot of that actually has to do with repeated reading and reporting on such articles. So I think there is no consistency in medical journalism. That is that I have seen, like, for example, if I mean, I can take an example of Priyanka Pulla. I mean, she is she is there on Twitter. She is focused on one particular aspect. And she does it so well. She's really good. She's excellent in that. I mean, she'll do that because she knows about it. She'll not go here and there. But if you look at other women journalists, what they do is they'll talk about one thing Monday, they'll talk about another thing another day.

Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Dr. Abby Phillips on on all of his work. And you know, the reason I first heard about you is we were I was, you know, Dinesh Thakur was on my show, we did a phenomenal episode where he spoke about our medical industry. And while we were chatting after the show or in the break, or whenever we were, you know, both ranting and raging against the quacks that surround us, and he said, I must check your work out.

And you know, before we get to talking about quacks, because I've also written against homeopaths and Ayurveds for a decade and a half and gotten into trouble for it. But before we get down to talking about that, I want to first talk about what medicine is like one thing which infuriates me is when we talk about medicine and alternative medicine. And my hope, the point I keep making is that there is no such thing as alternative medicine. There is medicine which works, which is modern medicine. And there is medicine which doesn't work or quote unquote, this stuff that doesn't work, we shouldn't even call it medicine. You know, this equivalence that people try to imply irritates me, I'm also for that reason, I hate the word allopath, because it was coined by the homeopaths as a pejorative term. And it makes you feel as if there is some kind of equivalence that these are two schools of thought. And no, they are not two schools of thought, you know, one is modern medicine that works evidence based medicine and one is not. So give us an understanding of what medicine means to you, what do we mean by modern medicine by evidence based medicine? What is medicine? What are our standards?"

I think from even doctors use it, even modern medicine doctors call themselves as allopaths, which is actually very wrong. Media uses it. You see everywhere in the papers, it's written allopathy, which is actually wrong. So what we are actually doing is, I mean, I would just call it as medicine. That is what it is. And if they want, I mean, if people want a little more clarification on that, then I can call it as science based medicine or scientific medicine or evidence based medicine. But it is medicine. And medicine is something that or science based medicine is something that we have evidence for its use. We don't use it because we believe that it could help. We don't use it because it has been used for thousands of years. And we don't use it because somebody has gotten some personal improvement or gratification by using it. That is not how medicine works. So we have a particular drug, call it as drug A, and we want to know if it reduces headache. So we first look at what the drug is. So we have a drug and we know that this drug is going to act on that particular receptor. And that particular receptor is going to modulate the pain. And what we want to know, and this we know from basic science studies and animal, small animal studies. Now we want to know if it works in humans too. And we apply it in small group of humans first to see if it actually reduces pain. If it does, then we do a larger trial, either compare it with placebo, which is a sham treatment, or compare it with a standard of care to see if it is equal to standard of care or better than that or inferior. And that happens with randomized control trials. And once you do that, what you're actually doing there is that you're controlling for every other factor that can actually affect the patient outcome. So for example, this is the problem with testimonials. There's a lot of people say that, oh, I've taken this drug and my throat pain has gone. So you take it. That is not right because that person could have had improvement in that throat pain even without taking that drug because of other factors, which we are not talking about in that particular story. That is the problem with the testimonial. But in a randomized control trial, such stories don't happen. We are controlled environment and we know exactly what is going to happen. And this is what we hypothesize. So you give the drug and it reduces pain in the humans. But side by side, we also look at other things that the drug is doing. It reduces pain, but is it causing any other problems for that particular group of patients? So we look at safety also. So we have efficacy, which is effectiveness of that particular drug. And then we also look at the safety of that particular drug. Now we know that this drug has some safety issues, but it's not too bad. We can still use it because its effectiveness is much, much bigger than the risk associated with it. So now we start approving it. So we have multiple randomized trials done and then we synthesize all of these randomized trials known as systematic review and meta-analysis, which is actually the highest level of evidence. Some people actually go one step higher and do meta-analysis of meta-analysis, which is even greater evidence. And once that comes and that goes into recommendations or treatment guidelines. So people look at meta-analysis and systematic reviews and they say that this drug is good for headache. It has good effects and very minimal risk. And your FDA or whoever the regulatory authorities approves it. Now people start taking this drug for headache. It doesn't end there. So now you have phase four. So in phase four, you do post-marketing surveillance. Because in a controlled environment, you're controlling for so many factors. And sometimes you're controlling it so much that you'll have a feeling of false safety in that. So when you actually give it out in the real world, you might actually find more side effects. And what happens is that in post-marketing, the drug companies, the regulatory authorities, they all see the number of patients who are developing any other major issues with that drug. And if some major new issues come, then that drug is then recalled. So you don't give it anymore. It goes out of the guidelines also. So this is what science is all about. Science is all about correcting itself. It never says that, yes, I can cure this. It never says that. That is what that term quackery comes. Only a quack can say that I can cure this. No, science never says that. Science will say this is the best option. There could be a better option. We are finding it out. And when the better option comes, the best option is out of the window. And this keeps happening for ever and ever and ever. That is how science is. It's evolutionary medicine. This is what scientific medicine is. And there are a lot of drugs that have been taken out of the market because they were actually good in first phase one, phase two, phase three trials. But when it came to real world scenario, it was found to be not useful or maybe more adverse events happened and it was recalled and thrown off. This particular aspect, the alternative medicine industry actually uses against science saying that, you know, look at Ayurveda and homeopathy. No drug has been recalled ever. But in modern medicine, you see how many drugs have been recalled. This is actually wrong because if there is no medicine recalled, that means you are not evolving. You are stuck in a time point. It's primal and primitive. The real medicines evolve and older medicines get chucked out. So this is the difference between a scientific medicine or what we call as actual medicine. And this is what actually is evidence based and beneficial for people."

        "message": "So let me try to summarize, you know, why this process is important and what it used to be in the past. In the past, before science evolves, you know, we make sense of the world by telling ourselves stories about it. So initially you have a sun god. But then when you realize the earth goes around the sun and there is a solar system, you don't need the sun god and you keep updating your frame of looking at the world, you keep updating your stories. Now, initially, medical systems evolved at a time where science was nowhere near this advanced, no germ theory, no understanding of infections and bacteria and viruses and genes and all of that. So you come up with kind of primitive stories and you come up with kind of primitive ways of treating people. Now, people begin to believe in some of this medicine because of the following reasons. One of course is a placebo effect, which we know is really powerful. This is classic case of Henry Beecher, an American anesthetist in the World War Two who ran out of morphine and use salt water instead. And the patient didn't know this salt water worked, which is a classic placebo effect. Placebo is incredibly powerful. That's one. The other factor that comes into play is reversion to the mean, like if I have a common cold is going to get better on its own, but it's you know, it's going to reach a peak, it's a bell curve is going to reach a peak is going to go back down is going to get better on its own. If and it is at its worst, I pop some sugar pills or I pop whatever I think is medicine at the time, and then it gets better. I will ascribe causation to that and say, I did this, it's fine. And the other is a confirmation bias that if you have a belief that something works for me, you will notice the times it works, but you will ignore the times it doesn't work and you will say, oh, that was whatever. So a lot of this anecdotal belief that oh, this has worked for me, that has worked for me is a combination of these things. Some of the time it was placebo, some of the times it just got better on its own as most things do, because the human body can be self healing in so many ways. And some of the time you're noticing the time something worked and something doesn't. Now what science does is that it takes these human frailties and these other factors like the placebo effect out of the window, where, you know, if you have, say, a double blind placebo control trial, right, what that essentially means is that, you know, you have two groups, one is given placebo, one is given the medicine you're testing, and it's double blind, because neither knows what they're getting. So the placebo effect, the power of belief can't come into play. And then you got to beat placebo, or as you pointed out, then you got to beat whatever the standard treatment is, if that is being measured against. And this goes through various phases, you have multiple trials, you have meta studies, after the medicine is released, you see what it's doing in the real world. And alternative medicine does not put itself through this, it hides behind the veil of tradition and say that, oh, it's always, you know, this stuff has always worked and all of that. And, you know, is this kind of a correct summation of"

        "message": "This is exactly the right summation. And I think alternative medicine, to some extent, has been studied in randomized control trials, and has failed it. And there are no good meta analysis also, I mean, you don't have the highest level of anything in alternative medicine, because alternative medicine to start with, they don't have a proper hypothesis. Because if I give an example of homeopathy, for example, homeopathy practitioners are not competent to diagnose the disease, because what they do is they treat the symptoms that because that is what they say, right, like cures like. So if a substance causes that particular effect in the human, that substance will actually cure it. That is what they say. So they essentially treat a group of symptoms, and they call it as totality of symptoms. And that has been wrongly interpreted as root cause, which is not the root cause. And when they treat only the symptoms, you are actually missing the forest for the trees. And that actually, what happens is that when you treat based on homeopathy principles, for example, you want to treat, let's say, hepatitis B. So hepatitis B virus can present with cirrhosis, it can present with jaundice, it can present with a fluid in the abdomen, which is known as ascites, it can present in very different ways, even as liver cancer, it can present. So if you ask a homeopath to apply their principles and treat for hepatitis B, they can never treat hepatitis B, because they will not know that this is the virus that is causing it. They'll be just treating what the patient will have as a symptom. And you cannot apply that in a scientific study setting, because when you actually study scientific medicine, you need to have a proper aim, you have to have an objective, you have to have a primary outcome and a secondary outcome. And when you apply these homeopathy principles, you can never actually materialize these outcomes and primary measures and everything because you are actually only treating the symptoms. So that is why when people say that research is lacking in homeopathy or Ayurveda, it is not lacking. It is because you can't research it. You can't research it because it is unscientific. We can only research scientific principles."

        "message": "Yeah. And just for the sake of our listeners, just take us into what the methodology of homeopathy because what I find so amusing is that their idea is that the more you dilute a substance, the more powerful it is, which of course, if you've studied basic chemistry, you know it as nonsense. And James Randi once asked a mathematician, Martin Gardner, that what it amounts to a particular kind of dilution. And this is what Martin Gardner said, where Martin Gardner said, quote, that's equivalent to taking one grain of rice, crushing it to a powder, dissolving it in a sphere of water the size of the solar system, with the sun at the center and the orbit of Pluto at the outside, and then repeating that process 2 million times, stop quote. So you know, the classic homeopathic dilutions for what are supposed to be the strongest medicines, it won't even be a single molecule of the substance, which is supposed to be treating you. You've got the memory of water and other woo-woo. And my first point about all of these systems, homeopathy is still relatively recent among the middle of the 19th century, but the rest of the stuff is centuries old, is that, and it's a point that you and Krishnashok have made in this great Instagram video, which I'll also link to from the show notes, is that all of these systems are okay as observational systems, but they cannot possibly have a theory of the world that is accurate, because there's no germ theory then, there is no understanding of bacteria, viruses, the human body, how genes work, you cannot have a theory of how something works, and if you have, if all your"

        "message": "first principles are wrong, if they're all fiction, how can you treat anything? How can you even test it? So that is the whole point about homeopathy, homeopathy is actually, I mean, it's wonderful if you want to actually have some entertainment, if you read about homeopathy, it's fascinating, because I mean, when Samuel Hahnemann, who actually invented homeopathy, he did it from a good perspective, because at that time, allopathy, the real allopathy was treating patients with very hardcore practices, for example, they made people vomit, induced vomiting, induced diarrhea, letting out blood, making them bleed, trepanation, that is burying, putting holes in the skull, you know, a lot of, a lot of such primal, primitive practices is what allopathy was, to add to that, it is still practiced in Ayurveda, by the way, so if somebody has to call something as allopathic, please do that to Ayurveda, because in Ayurveda, there is something known as panchakarma, where they actually induce vomiting and diarrhea and put leeches on the body to suck out blood, bad blood and good blood and stuff like that, which is actually allopathy. So allopathy exists, yes, but that is in Ayurveda, it's not modern medicine. And coming back to homeopathy, so he, Samuel Hahnemann saw that and that was actually harming and hurting the patients more, so he wanted a very soft version of that. So instead of giving strong stuff, he decided that he will give everything in a very dilute manner so that people can tolerate it. And they did, because he diluted so much that there is nothing left in it. So people tolerated it. But the whole principles were actually wrong. So what happened was that, if you follow Professor Edzard Ernst on Twitter, he has written brilliantly that the whole aspect of like cures like came with Hahnemann's exposure to Sinkhona. So what happened was that, he said that if you take, for example, for malarial fevers, you have fever and nausea and rigor and everything. And when he took Sinkhona, he actually felt that, he had rigor and nausea and everything. But that was actually because of Sinkhonism. That is because of he took additional Sinkhona and that was Sinkhona poisoning. It is not because like cured like. So the whole aspect of like cures like was actually based on a mistake, a misunderstanding. And from there came homeopathy. So the basic principle is fallacious. And like can never cure like. It is impossible. Number one. Second is, Hahnemann said that if you dilute the substance more, then it becomes more potent. The stronger the substance is, it is less potent, which is actually wrong. It is against chemistry and physics principles. And the third thing. So when people started using homeopathy and patients started getting better, better because of maybe placebo effect, everybody asked, how does homeopathy work then? I mean, there has to be a principle of mechanism of working. So then came the third part, which is theory of vitalism. He says that there is something known as vital force inside the body, which gets completely imbalanced because of whatever disease process. And if you do this, like cures like and, you know, give a high potency, which is high potency means very, very dilute stuff to people, the vital force gets balanced. And that is how homeopathy works, which is absolutely nonsense because you cannot measure or see vital force. There is nothing called vital force. So this vital force theory became obsolete because nobody could prove the vital force theory. Then homeopaths thought long and hard and decided that, you know, you have to come up with a mechanism. Other people will start disbelieving them. Then came the water theory. So they said that, you know, you are succussioning the stuff so much in the vehicle, either water or alcohol. The active substance may not be there, but its essence is there and the water understands that essence and that essence is what treats. So to confirm this, very interestingly, they did some theoretical and practical studies on it, but could never prove it, that water has memory. Nobody has proved it. So the water theory went out of the window. Then science progressed and homeopaths understood that there is now something known as nanoparticles. So they said that, you know what, actually we were wrong about the water theory. It's actually nanoparticles. Nanoparticles is what is doing it. OK, so now we can show that there are nanoparticles. So there was a study from IIT Bombay and this is a hilarious study where IIT Bombay experts showed that if you look at the most ultra-diluted homeopathic forms, it contains nanoparticles and the nanoparticles, they identified through some major experiments and showed that nanoparticles are present. So this is the reason why homeopathy works. Now that same set of experiments was redone by another group in Belgium, a group of homeopaths in Belgium, because even they want to know, because a big thing, right, homeopathy finally has a mechanism. So they did it and they found out nanoparticles. But what they actually found was that when the, I mean, if you know how the homeopath prepares that medicine, you know that they shake it vigorously to and fro and multiple times. So they found out that the nanoparticle was actually not part of the medicine. It was actually part of the bottle. Your silica particles from the bottle and it has nothing to do with the medicine. So nanoparticle failed there. So they didn't have nothing to hold on to. Now they have brought out quantum physics. So now there is a quantum theory of homeopathy. There are a lot of theories coming up. So I think now once 5G comes, 7G comes, I think they'll use those terms also as a part of mechanism of homeopathy. So this is the story behind homeopathy. Even now, homeopaths don't know, patients who improve personally with homeopathy don't realize how it worked. So we don't have a mechanism. We have three principles that are completely bogus, and we have medicines that contain no medicine. So this is the story of homeopathy. And if people actually understand this, I don't think they will actually go for homeopathy. The problem is people don't understand homeopathy. They don't know in depth about homeopathy. So if you know about it, I don't think people actually will go for it."

And it came and for two or three months, it was really bad. I tried proper medicine, sad I should have to use the word proper, but we have to distinguish now for this conversation and that didn't work. And somebody then said, go to a homeopath and in those days, I wasn't that well read, I hadn't read up so much. So I went to a homeopath and after some trial and error, my thing went away. So for a couple of years, I was a believer, I ascribed it to that. Then later, of course, I read about it and I figured out that okay, what happened was either placebo, or the thing got would have gotten better anyway over the course of time as it tends to do, I also realized. So it kind of wasn't that at all. But I run into so many people who are otherwise rational, who will say no, no, but it worked for me, it worked for me. And you know, if you just think a little deeper, you know, how can it possibly work for you? And one of the great myths about homeopathy is that, hey, it won't harm you. You know, even though sugar is poison, so sugar pills, but leaving that aside, they say, hey, it won't harm you. But my point is that if you put the economist hat on, we have a term called opportunity cost, you know, where you know, and there is an opportunity cost, if instead of taking proper medicine, which you should take, you take these useless sugar pills, then it can harm you because of that you should have gotten a particular treatment instead, you've relied on these and whatever disease you have get worse. And this happened in Australia where a few years ago, there was this homeopath couple of Indian origin, their daughter, their child, I forget the gender, the child had eczema, and they tried to treat the child with homeopathy and the child died. And thankfully, they were imprisoned. But even then, it's an incredibly tragic story of how it almost sort of becomes ideological in the same way that if you believe in a religion, or if you adopt an ideology, you know, our sense of self is so tied up with it, that we cannot take a challenge to it. It is a personal challenge. And and you know, and I think beliefs in you know, the story we tell ourselves about the world can contain religion or ideology or it can contain that, hey, homeopathy is good for you, or Ayurveda really works and all of that. So when did you like, talk a little bit more about this myth, because even beyond opportunity costs, there are ways in which homeopathy is harmful and such belief is harmful. Tell me about that."

        "message": "I think I mean, there are three ways that homeopathy can be harmful. One is like you said, it drives the patient away from the real treatment. So for example, everybody who says that, you know, they have benefited from homeopathy for whatever diseases, they should understand that every disease has something known as a natural history. So for example, if you take COVID, majority of patients with COVID, they it resolves only if a small proportion actually develop severe COVID and there are reasons for it, risk factors to it. But otherwise, influenza or a viral infection, it happens, it takes a few days, peaks, and then by the seventh day, you're okay, you have cough and cold and things, it goes away. Now what happens is that people need outcomes and results quickly, right? So they'll do a lot of things initially, they'll go for all these proper treatments, everything in the first five days. And once it starts peaking, they say that, you know, we have taken this stuff for five days and the sixth day it is still bad. So now let us drop this and let us go for homeopathy. So they take homeopathy on the sixth day, but automatically the disease is supposed to come down on the seventh day, it goes down on the seventh day. So there is a post hoc fallacy there. They think that homeopathy is what actually decreased it. Now you extrapolate this to a real disease. I mean, these are self limiting diseases. So the natural history of self limiting diseases is that they will limit themselves at some point and some of them will limit in a few days, some in a few weeks, some in a few months. But if you actually treat a disease which really requires treatment, for example, if I talk about hepatitis B virus infection, which actually requires antiviral treatment and you give homeopathy, that disease is going to flare and that disease is going to kill the patient because there is no proper treatment given. So real diseases, if you give homeopathy, you are actually driving the patient away from real treatments and that lands the patient in trouble. And second is that this is an unregulated area of alternative medicine. Nobody has standardized homeopathy medicines. A lot of companies make it, governments make it. There is no standard saying that, you know, this homeopathy from this company is equal to that homeopathy from that company. There is no standard. It's unregulated. So we have a lot of homeopathy medicines which are either adulterated or contaminated. So a sensible homeopath knows that it's just water, there is no active molecule. And he knows that you need something active in it to work. So they adulterate it. And this is very common. There are a lot of studies on it, papers published on it saying that alternative medicines, especially homeopathy is heavily adulterated and they decide what to adulterate it with. So if they want to treat fever, you will have a paracetamol in it. If you want to treat arthritis or some allergies, there will be steroids in it. So they adulterate it. Now the problem is that they don't actually know proper pharmacology. So what they do is they adulterate it to extents that it is toxic or they adulterate it with old world drugs, for example, old world painkillers or anabolic steroids and things like that, which actually harms the patient. So that is how, secondly, homeopathy harms because of adulteration and contamination. Third is something known as poor manufacturing practices. So you have 200 C dilution means it's just plain water. It's so diluted, you'll get nothing in it. But sometimes they don't actually dilute it so much. The manufacturing will be actually problematic, poorly manufactured and it will actually have parts of the mother tinger in it, the mother compound, which is actually alcohol and the active ingredient. So you'll have arsenic or lead or some toxic herb in it and that actually can produce toxicity in the human and this leads to adverse events. So you'll have poor manufacturing, contamination, adulteration and because homeopathy was given for a real disease which required real medical management, patients get harmed. The commonest, if you look at all the patient stories who have improved from homeopathy, I think number one will be allergy. Number one will be allergy, bronchial asthma or something to do with the skin. You know, that's what commonly homeopaths treat and it'll be in a child mostly. You know, my child got relieved with homeopathy. That's the commonest testimonial that you get. And it's very important to realize that bronchial asthma or childhood asthma or childhood allergies, they go away after eight to nine years of age. So what they do is they'll give two years. First two years is when the allergies is very bad, they'll give modern medicine, everything is not going away. And the homeopath will say that homeopathy is a long drawn process. You have to keep giving it for years, it'll go away. So by the time they are five years old, they'll start homeopathy, three years they'll give, by the time the child is eight, nine years old, the allergy is gone. And they think it is because of homeopathy. So every homeopathic testimonial is actually linked to the natural history of the disease. Tell me any patient who has had a lung cancer or an infection with a bacteria or an infection with a virus like HIV or hepatitis B or hepatitis C treated with homeopathy and virus is gone or cancer is gone. You will never hear such stories. You will never hear. You will hear it when homeopathy is used along with cancer medication as an integrative medicine. That is the next fraud that they do. Integrative medicine. You mix something that works with something that doesn't work and attribute the whole thing to the thing that doesn't work. So you have chemotherapy and radiotherapy going on and then you add homeopathy to it and you say that, you know, homeopathy also worked. So that integrative medicine part is also another story which they spin to mislead people."

But Ayurveda is very different because not only it's part of alternative medical care, it's considered health care. It has very strong traditional, religious and cultural roots. And of course, we are in India and India is the birthplace of it. And because when you have to talk about Ayurveda and when I say Ayurveda is a pseudoscience or it is not scientific, I mean it purely from its scientific, its principles. I don't mean it from, you know, I don't say it because it's from India and India is a developing country. So it is all, it's not like that. People take it in that sense. It's not like that. You actually look at the principles where we use, for example, we discuss principles of scientific medicine, how a drug comes into the market and can go back or can be used for long. We discussed about that. But when you discuss about Ayurveda, look at the principles of Ayurveda, just like principles of homeopathy, the Ayurvedic principles are also all unscientific. For example, Ayurveda believes that diseases in the body are caused by imbalances in humors. The humoral theory that Galen initially proposed as one of the, so at that time there were four humors. Ayurveda has three humors, that is a Tridosha. So they say that there is this Vayu, Pitta, Kapha, these things get imbalanced and then patients develop these diseases. So we basically balance them and it becomes better. And then they have Prakriti and a lot of philosophical stuff. Now it's all philosophy. And if you ask an Ayurved to show where Kapha is or Pitta is or please define it, they will never give you a straight answer because you cannot measure it. You cannot identify it. It exists only in imagination and in philosophy. It's not actually part of anything. That makes Ayurveda a pseudoscience. And based on that, how can you treat someone? Because based on that, you cannot diagnose anyone in the first place. So just like homeopathy, Ayurveda also treats symptoms. But they claim they treat root cause, unlike modern medicine, which treats only the symptoms, which is wrong. It's like a propaganda that they keep on talking about. Ayurveda does not treat any root cause. If at all there is a root cause identifiable and treatable, and that is through scientific medicine only. For example, jaundice. Ayurveda will treat every jaundice as jaundice. But we know that jaundice can be because of many, many reasons. You know, jaundice can be liver related, it can be blood related also. So you can have hemolytic anemias where your red blood cells get destroyed and you can have jaundice because of that. Or you can have a liver failure because of different types of viruses or alcohol or autoimmune liver disease and you can have jaundice because of that. So you treat the cause of jaundice, then the jaundice goes away. But Ayurveda treats only jaundice. So you have a set of things to do for a patient of jaundice and you don't actually treat anything there. No root cause, nothing. It mostly worsens the patient. So in Ayurvedic principles, and when I talk about Ayurveda, the biggest problem that Ayurveds bring to the table is that, are you an Ayurveda practitioner?"

And it is part of scientists and clinical scientists to actually talk about pseudosciences because it is important for their practice, routine practice also, which is why I talk about it. And also, I have read the whole thing. I have four versions of Susruta Samhita, two versions of Charaka Samhita. I have Ashtanga Hridaya, which are the three pillars of Ayurvedic classical texts, and I have read them from cover to cover. And I'm sorry to say, it is completely pseudoscientific. There is nothing in it, except maybe there are some good points on nutrition. In the sense that not the real nutrition, but some stuff they say that in observational part is pretty good about nutrition and some observations are pretty good. For example, Susruta Samhita, they talk about some surgical procedures, pretty decent stuff, but it has all evolved from them. And the other whole aspect of it is completely pseudoscientific. But to talk about Ayurveda from this aspect is not easy because people are not going to listen to it. What people do is that directly they'll jump into the other aspects of Ayurveda, which is religion, tradition and culture. So they'll say that we have been using it for 2000 years and it is still here. It has not gone away, which means it is useful, which is actually appealing to tradition fallacy. That is not how you use something. It is here because it's part of our tradition and culture and not because it is a science. Second is people say that Ayurveda has been, you know, it is actually, you're talking against Ayurveda because you are a Christian. These are the stuff that I get on Twitter. You're a Christian, you don't know everything, but you're anti-Hindu, you're anti-Indian. Go back to Pakistan and things like that. So that is the second type of argument that they bring. And the third type of argument they bring is that you are losing business. You know, Ayurveda treats patients and improves them. You are not getting that business. So you are losing business. You're talking bad about Ayurveda. These three arguments are actually nothing to do with the science. They are not rational or scientific arguments. And the best part is that people erroneously think that Ayurveda is making us lose business. It's actually the opposite. I am actually getting more patients because they go for alternative medicine. You know, somebody who's just sitting at home having some gas trouble, instead of taking a little bit of, you know, Digene or something, some antacid, something, they go for Ayurveda, they prescribe him a bunch of herbals and that herbals will actually cause him some herb induced liver injury. Then they come to my hospital, get admitted, pay for the biopsy, pay for the hospital charges, ultimately get a transplant and pay 25 lakhs. So who's getting the business here? I'm actually getting more business here because of Ayurveda. So it's not like I'm losing business. And I don't want that business. You know, that is the whole point. I want people to stop doing that, stop harming themselves so that we lose business. This is the whole aspect of it. But people don't understand this part. They directly jump into these irrational arguments when you talk about Ayurveda. Come straight, talk about scientific reasons or whatever you can bring to the table from a scientific point of view in Ayurveda, you will see that it is a house of cards. That is why Ayurvedas don't come for a direct confrontation ever. Even on Twitter, you can actually see, I mean, I just put up something on arsenic album on homeopathy and you can just see the responses underneath by an Ayurved. He's just abusing me in Hindi. I mean, it's complete, I mean, they're just irrational when it comes to arguments. So you cannot win an argument with them. And they feel that they have won because we don't, we ignore them at some point, right? And this is how it goes. So Ayurvedic principles and homeopathy principles are both unscientific and not, not sound enough to call it a science. And this is the biggest. And same with Siddha. I mean, if I don't talk about Siddha and the Unani, people will say that, you know, you're not talking about Unani because Unani has a different culture. It is mostly in the Perso-Arabic, this thing, it's part of more of part of Muslim culture. And Siddha is mostly regional in Tamil Nadu. But Siddha also has a Tridosha theory. Unani has four humors instead of three. It has something known as black bile also. The others have bile, kapha and vayu. Unani has black bile also, that is the original Galenic humor theory. So this is only the difference, but all of them are pseudosciences."

There was no concept of the brain as a separate organ. And my thing is that, you know, when we are knocking Ayurveda and despite not being Christian like you, I'm still going to knock it as vehemently that when we are knocking it as a pseudoscience, it's not exactly dissing the original Ayurvedas or the field as it evolved.

And you know what you correctly earlier, we were speaking of how homeopathy became popular in a time where, you know, just going to hospital could kill you because infections were so rampant when modern medicine as it then was, was at such a primitive stage. It is natural that people preferred sugar pills might even have been better for them. But the difference, the reason why modern medicine has advanced so much and the reason that all of these have stayed more or less fixed in time is the scientific method. You know, it is falsifiability. It is a scientific method. You keep brushing up against reality, testing everything, testing, testing, testing, understanding the world better, admitting your mistakes, moving ahead. And therefore you see such a sea change, you know, in proper medicine in the last 200 years while homeopathy is still there, you're still diluting that stuff and possibly."

And a lot of funding has been stopped in the NHS and in Germany, people have to pay from their pockets to actually avail homeopathic services now. It's not part of the public funding system anymore. Why? Because we have progressed. We don't, we don't do that because for us, I think this is a big part of our big part of our economy. You know, it brings in money and it's not easy to just one day suddenly make it vanish. So there are a lot of reasons why it stays here in India and gets and gets the limelight it is getting now. And science is not one of it. That is the whole aspect of it. It is not here because it is scientific, it is here because of other reasons other than science and healthcare."

The reason why people develop paracetamol poisoning is either because of overdosing as part of an attempt of attempted suicide, or it is because of overdosing accidentally. That happens mostly in children, because mothers or fathers, they actually give more than what is required to reduce the fever. And that actually causes the trouble. Otherwise, paracetamol is actually the safest drug in the world if you use it as recommended and routinely. But it is the poster boy for anti modern medicine from the alternative medicine industry, because unfortunately it is the commonest cause associated with liver failure because of overdosing or because of attempted suicides.

So even if they don't attack the messenger, they are still comfortable. But in, in homeopathy, it's different because you have to go by testimonials to keep it alive. Homeopathy survives only on testimonials and nothing else. And because of that, and it has nothing to do with patient care or health care or compassionate care, nothing. It has everything to do with business. So when you attack homeopathy or criticize homeopathy, you're actually criticizing the business of homeopathy. You're actually reducing the business of homeopathy. And I think this is what makes them really angry. Because you, you don't want to lose patients. For me, when I, if I lose patients or gain patients, it's, it's not like I'm thinking from business point of view. You know, I've lost so many patients or I've gained so many patients or today I got two new patients. I mean, I don't think like that. But homeopaths do. They actually are, they actually are more into the business of health care than actual patient care. You know, it's, it's totally different. And every alternative medical practice is actually business of health care. It has nothing to do with the compassion of patient care. It has nothing. They will say that they are more compassionate. I mean, I do appreciate two things in homeopathy and Ayurveda. And I would, I am going to be open about it. The time that they spend with the patient. Marvelous. I mean, like we spoke in our initial questions, we were saying that, you know, modern medicine doctors see so many patients, they don't have time to spend. A lot of patients, why they go away from modern medicine to alternative practices like Ayurveda and homeopathies, because they listen to them. They hear them out because they have more time to spend with the patient. A homeopath actually takes about two and a half to three hours of history alone from the patient. And they ask them everything. What time do you take a bath? How do you go to sleep? How are you sleeping? I mean, these are not related anything to disease, but they still ask them and that is at a personal level. So they feel more comfortable and more confident with that particular homeopath rather than that modern medicine doctor who just prescribes some pills and push them away. So this is something so important. And I think if a modern medicine doctor has to learn something from homeopathy and Ayurveda, it is that you have to talk to your patient because without that communication skill, things don't work out well for both of you. And this is where I want to bring in something that I wanted to talk to you before, where I said that I had an episode of violence against me. And this was initially starting from my... and this is when I understood the importance of patient communication. That is how I learned. I mean, as a doctor, I think we have to learn it the hard way. These are things that are... these things are not taught in colleges. And I hope younger doctors also listen to this podcast because they should know this. You don't... they don't teach you this in colleges. And I think it's very important because patient communication is what clinches everything. And what happened was that there was this patient with severe alcoholic liver disease and that patient was so sick and we advised for a transplantation. They had no money. They had probably 9 or 10 lakhs to spare for the whole thing, for the transplant. And little bit left for the other post-transplant care. And the transplantation at that time was not active in my unit. It was only in some other hospital. So I had to refer them to another hospital. But they quoted about 25 lakhs for the transplant at that time. This was about 6-7 years back. And they said that, sir, there is no way we can do it. But we want to do it because we want to help our father. So I said that, you know, I studied in ILBS. ILBS has a very cheap transplant, this thing, charges. So they transplant patients. At that time, they used to transplant patients within 10-11 lakhs. So it was like a big deal for them. So they took this patient by flight. Somehow I optimized him, stabilized him. I just said, go do a transplant. I did not say anything more than that. And they just went. So they thought everything is going to be fine. You go there, get transplanted. So by the time he reached there, this patient became very sick. So my mistake was that I did not tell them regarding how this disease is going to progress, what to expect and what not to expect. So I did not tell them that severe alcoholic liver disease is associated with infections at any time. Patients can bleed any time. Patients can develop sudden blockage of veins in the liver at any time. They can crash any time. And this can happen during the workup time before you reach there. I did not tell them all this in detail. So the moment they arrived at ILBS, patient got very sick. He was on the ventilator for about a couple of weeks. The money that they had collected for the liver transplant actually went into just managing the complications of this patient on ventilator. So finally, when the doctors there optimized him for transplant, they ran out of money. And then ultimately he died there under hospice care. So he was supposed to die here in his home. He went all the way to Delhi and died there. Bystanders, family, furious. I mean, there was nothing I could do there. And I understood it was my fault. So they came back after everything, after the burial, everything. And I never knew about it. He just messaged me saying that, you know, the patient has died. So I asked him what happened. He said, no, he died of infection and things like that. And I said, OK. I did not even say anything more than that because it was on the phone, on WhatsApp. Nothing more I could say. And I just left it there. After two months later, after everything was settled, his son, nephew and another guy, I think his brother, they came into my OPD, they just he just, I mean, banged on my table and said, you destroyed our family. So I was like shocked. I did not know who this guy was. I suddenly I forgot it was it was almost two months after his death. And then suddenly he said that because of you, my father, who was supposed to die at home in Kerala, he died in Delhi. And then he started abusing me right, left and center. They took my chair and they beat up my I mean, beat the table and some stuff there, destroyed my files and everything. And then they abused me. And then they left while they were going out. They told every other patient was sitting there that don't go into this guy's room. He will kill your family and things like that. I mean, it was so bad. I was so I mean, I've never faced that kind of stuff because I've done everything good for the patient. I mean, as a doctor, we don't want to do anything bad for any patient. We do everything thinking that is going to be good for the patient. And I did all that, called up those people, arranged everything for his travel. And I did all that. And I got so shocked that they came back and did this to me. Then I reflected on it. I was depressed for a whole week or two. I think I am still depressed when I think about that episode, because it was quite bad. I mean, I when patients become violent towards you, it's because you spend all your life, you're you're learning about. Yeah, I did. I studied for 15 years medicine to help people. And then once this happens to you, you feel like an utter failure. You know, you're like lost. Did you talk to them again? No, I did not. Because I think it I don't think it mattered because they they just left. And I think at some point they would have also cooled down because I did not want to make things worse. And I was depressed for about a couple of weeks. And then I at that time, I reflected on what went wrong. And I think every doctor should do that. If somebody if something is going on in your practice and your patients or family is not satisfied, please reflect what is happening. You have to always self assess. A lot of doctors don't do that. And I figured it out that, you know, it was because of poor communication. And from that time onwards, I tell the pros and cons of everything to all my patients. Like we discussed before, I talked to them regarding finances also, everything is on the table for everyone to see. And I've never had a single episode of violence against me after that. Not a single episode when people die. And when my patients die, actually, their family comes to my room. They cry a lot in front of me and they thank me. I feel sad because I could not save that patient. But they come and they thank me and I feel that I have done my part. You know, it is satisfying in in a bittersweet way, but they never become violent towards me. And this is the this is the sleep that I spoke to you about. It's not a good sleep. But for me, I mean, I cannot explain it. I sleep well at night because of this. And this is very important. And this is what I think one should learn from the alternative medicine industry, the way they talk to people. I mean, if I talk to when I when I say that, you know, this homeopathic medicine is what caused liver injury to you or this Ayurveda is what liver injury to you. Patients defend them. Patients defend the Ayurvedic practitioner and the homeopath saying that no. He's a good man. Yes. That is the power of communication. And I don't know why people doctors can't understand it. Just imagine if every medical doctor, proper medical doctor communicates properly with the patient. You will not have this alternative medicine industry."

They tell me that you, it's very interesting the way you talk to the patient. And that is what actually impresses them.

So if you are a teacher who is just going to prescribe, the student will also just prescribe. If you are a teacher who is interested only doing endoscopies for the patient, the student will also do endoscopies for a patient which who does not even require endoscopy, you know, because that is what he's been taught and he's been exposed to."

        "message": "So this actually started off with so when I came back to Cochin to practice as a consultant junior consultant, initially, my whole idea was to work on alcohol associated liver disease, because Kerala is replete with it. And it was my interest. You know, you did stool transplants, you have so many new things happening in that. So that was my interest. So what happened was that I came here with a mindset to study alcoholic liver disease. But what what I faced in real life in my OPD is that I started seeing a lot of patients with hepatitis and jaundice without any cause. No, they had no known reasons for their hepatitis and jaundice and they're like acute, they presented quickly. It's not like it's like a chronic ongoing process. Suddenly, within a few weeks, they're developing jaundice and hepatitis. So hepatitis is when you have inflammation of the liver and your liver function tests will show very high abnormalities in your enzymes, SGOT, SGPT and all that. And you'll have jaundice. Jaundice is clinically defined as bilirubin more than three, total bilirubin. Lot of people actually mistake it as the lab value. If it slightly goes up, they call it jaundice. It's not the clinical jaundice is above three. So what we did was that when we looked at these patients background in the sense that three, six months prior to development of this jaundice, when we looked at that this this particular group of patients, all of them were actually consuming traditional medicines, you know, herbal medicines and homeopathy and whatnot. And at that time, we did not figure it out because the common sense at that time was that natural is herbal and safer, no side effects. Everybody uses that because it's safe when we looked at these products. So what we did was we identified that traditional medicines were being consumed and the timing was actually fitting. This is known as temporal correlation. So they started at some point the traditional medicine and then they developed jaundice and it fits it. And you look at all the other causes of jaundice, they're all not there. It's all negative. So this herb induced or drug induced liver injury is basically a diagnosis of exclusion. You say that all the other stuff is not there and this is the stuff and it it fits with the timing and we did liver biopsies. So once we did the liver biopsy, we identified. So if somebody is consuming alcohol, there will be a signature in the liver, right? That is how we identify. Alcoholic liver disease has a particular signature. So you know, this is alcohol. Viral hepatitis has a signature, you know, it's viral hepatitis. Even modern medicines like paracetamol, when you take, if it's toxic, you'll have a particular type of pattern of liver injury. When we looked at the liver biopsies of all these patients, it was like crazy. It was like patterns never seen before in the sense that you'll have patterns of paracetamol poisoning, patterns of alcohol poisoning, patterns of viral hepatitis, patterns of autoimmune hepatitis, everything in a single patient, which is impossible. So my pathologist was quite confused, like what is happening to these patients? Then we look back and we retrieved these ayurvedic supplements, herbal medicines that they were taking, we analyzed them and we found out that they had multiple liver toxic components in it, including herbs, adulterants, contaminants. So they actually brought out a mix, a match of types of different types of liver injuries in these patients. And these were the cause of liver injury in these patients. So we proved it. This is what we published in 2017-2018 in Indian Journal of Gastroenterology, which is the official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology, one of the oldest societies in India, a very, very influential and famous society. The moment this was published, that traditional thinking was completely broken. You know, we say that, you know, natural does not mean safe and herbal is not safe. Ayurvedic herbals are not safe. It can actually cause liver injury. And some of these liver injuries are severe enough that patients can die or they can go for a transplant. So we did that beautifully done paper. It was, it actually got an editorial also written on it. And that editorial actually was the highest downloaded article in the history of that journal. It was that, that, that effective. And this came out in the papers, the Times of India ran a story on it, then started all the trouble. So what happened was that Ayush Ministry figured it out. Something has happened. This has come out and Ayurvedic herbals are not safe. There is a side effect as well. So they started to email me. So initially it was in good faith emails saying that, you know, you have identified this and which is something unique and things like that. And we would like to talk to you regarding this. I said, okay, let us talk about it. Then the second mail came that you have to come to us alone, to our place, to the ministry. We will arrange for your stay and everything. You have to come alone. We have to discuss alone. So I said, I'm not going to come alone. Why do you mention that you have to come alone? I mean, my co-authors are there, senior authors are there. We'll come. No, you, you come alone. That's, that's fine. Then I said that I showed some resistance because I said that, what do you want to know actually? And what do you want to discuss about? If it is about changing policies or bringing about a change in the herbal industry, because you are the top apex guys sitting on top there, then I'm ready to have a conversation. They said that. Then came a very weird kind of a letter accusing me of a lot of defamation and all that, saying that you did not check for this. You did not check for that. You did not take the permission of Ayurveda industry and Ayush before you publish this paper. You know, some nonsense like that. I mean, why do you need their permission to publish a scientific paper? And so many things like that. And you don't, you do not, you do not have an Ayurveda author in that. You should have an Ayurveda author only then this is going to be valid and things like that. I mean, crazy stuff. So I said, you know, these guys are just trolling me. And I stopped. I started ignoring. But these letters kept on coming. And ultimately they said that, okay, you can call the editor in chief of the journal and you come alone. And then we'll discuss. I said, no. There will be drug-induced liver injury experts, there will be hepatologists, there will be clinical scientists, and there will be journal people also who will have a panel discussion with you on this. So that something good comes out of it. We'll have to make some guidelines or bring out some information for the people. No news after that. They stopped messaging me after that, when I said that. Then I think, I think, I'm not sure how that happened, but two private Ayurveda pharmaceutical companies filed a case against me saying that I'm defaming them. So one was this big company called Pankajagasturi, it's in Kerala. They market products for arthritis and asthma. And for arthritis, that particular product that they market called Orthoherb, I had actually analyzed that and published it in my paper. And I've shown that it had high levels of arsenic and it was contaminated. And that news actually spread like wildfire in Kerala because every household was using this particular product. So he filed an FIR against me and cops came to my OPD during my OP hours and started questioning me regarding this, about defamation and things like that. But cops were brilliant. I told them this is part of a scientific paper, they understood and they left me. So that part got cancelled. So this guy was like really pissed off. He filed another case in another police station against me. And again, those cops came. And they were a little more into the investigation. Again they wasted a lot of my time, my father's time also, while we were seeing patients. And then they wanted to interview all the authors. So I have a pathologist as an author. I have the biomedical guy who does the analysis for me. And they're all from Cochin University of Science and Technology. I mean, real, valid, legit people. And they went and spoke to all of them. And the pathologist was actually quite badly, I mean, in the sense that they were a little strong on him. He had to show all the slides that he looked at, explain all that stuff. He was just harassed quite a bit. And he was really down. And he was the pathologist who actually identified these new patterns of liver injury. And that is like something unique. So that paper actually was completely on his shoulders. I mean, his finding is what helped me publish this paper. He was so harassed that he actually left the country. He left India and is now working in the UAE and he's peaceful there. He said, I'm not going to come back again if this is what happens to a scientist or a physician when they bring out scientific truths, I'm not going to come back. So he started working abroad and he's not come back. So I lost a good member in my team. And once this happened and we started seeing problems with other systems of alternative medicine also, like homeopathy. So we started talking about homeopathy related liver injury. So I have, I published a lot of papers on Ayurveda related liver injury in normal people. Ayurveda, if cirrhosis patients, if they consume Ayurveda, what happens to them? That paper we published. And even alcohol liver disease patients, if they consume Ayurveda, what happens to them? So we have a bunch of good original papers on this. And the all papers have shown that these patients have very poor survival without a transplant. For example, if you take patients with alcoholic liver disease who take herbal medicines, the only 18% of them will survive at six months and that's a very low number. That's 18% of patients. I mean, that's about 90% of them, 80% of them dead for nothing, without proper treatment and without a transplant. Even in the case of cirrhosis patients, when they take Ayurveda for other reasons like diabetes or whatever, 53% of them die. And these are all unnecessary health burden. We can actually avoid it, you know, avoidable health burden. These people should have survived for longer duration, for decades, if they did not consume that herbal medicine. So that was the whole point. So then we started publishing on homeopathy. So we have had a lot of patients who develop alcoholic liver disease because of homeopathy. Because of homeopathy. Because homeopaths, what they do is they know that the diluted stuff is diluted and there is nothing in it. So they start giving patients mother tinctures. Mother tinctures are potent. I mean, for them it's not potent, for them it's low potency, but for us it is very potent. Mother tinctures contain absolute alcohol, about 90 to 94% and then active ingredient like arsenic or lead or something like that. And patients consume this to get the effect and they develop real proper adverse events because of that. We have had bone injury, we have had even patients with bone marrow failure after consuming homeopathy medicines, mother tincture. And we published that and we spoke about it. Homeopaths are a totally different breed when it comes to, you know, responses. A group of homeopaths, I'm talking about practitioners, I mean, they consider themselves as doctors. They took a car from North Kerala, came all the way, identified my lab somehow, the lab where I analyze these products, they identified the lab. They harassed my lab members, the security and everybody, took videos, live videos of that lab and then put it on Facebook calling for violence against them. So the homeopathy sympathizers and apologists on their behalf started writing below that particular post saying that we'll kill them and stuff like that. I mean, crazy. My lab members got so scared and the lab director told me that, you know, this is something we did not expect this and I was so worried for them and I was so sorry that it got leaked out somehow. And I told them that, you know what, let us stop this because they were the ones who helped me with all the analysis of my, all the drugs and all the papers we published was just because of their beautiful work. And I had to cut ties with them because I wanted to, I want to make sure that they don't get into any more physical trouble. So I had to stop my analytical work for almost a year before another lab agreed to work with me. And we have, we have a lab now who's working with us, totally anonymous. It's not, it's nowhere in the state also. And they are doing the work for us now. But because of this, because the homeopaths responded so badly, harassed my lab members, leading to the closure of our deal, I lost a whole year of research work because of that. And that's actually quite, quite, if you look at a clinical scientist, that's actually quite a, quite a huge time that is lost. So these are the two major events that happened and two, three major events, actually, I mean, from the AYUSH ministry, from the pharma lobby, and also from the homeopaths directly. In between this, something else happened, you know, this is nothing to do with Ayurveda per se, but it is to do with the herbal and supplement industry that is Herbalife. So I published a paper on Herbalife related liver injury, where a patient actually died, a young woman died, 23, 24 years of age with two kids. She died after consuming Herbalife products. And this is not the first time it has happened, Herbalife is well known to cause liver injury and death. And about, before I published my paper, more than 70 cases of Herbalife related liver injury has been published from all over the world, Switzerland, Israel, Europe, everywhere. And mine was the first from India, from Asia Pacific region. And we published that. And Herbalife is a different kind of monster. It is nothing like what we deal with the Ayurveda industry, they mailed me a nice mail initially asking about patient details and all. So I gave them, I said that everything is in the paper. So I forwarded the paper to them. The second mail I got was from an attorney in Delhi saying that, you know, I have defamed Herbalife. So you have to pay 2 million US dollars. They're going to sue me for 2 million US dollars. So I said, sue me, no problem, because I have evidence to show in the court, you're not going to win this, you sue me, no problem. So I was holding my ground. What they did was something unexpected. So they did not communicate with me anymore. They directly started suing the journal and the publisher. So the report where I published that report in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, JCH, and the publisher was Elsevier. So they sent a lot of legal letters to them, to the journal editorial board, to the assistant editor of the journal. These people are like not expecting this, right? And I mean, I can fight in the court, because I have some good friends and lawyers and everybody who's ready to willing to help me. But these people, if they actually have to fight in the court, they have to pay from their pockets. Nobody's going to help them out and all that. So they actually got scared of this legal threat. And they issued an apology letter without telling me and called my, and in that apology letter without any proper scientific validation, they called my paper unscientific and said that everything that I had written in the paper was actually wrong and they are sorry for it. And they sent this apology letter to Herbalife. And because of that, my paper was removed, removed without my permission. And this was actually a big deal for Herbalife and science lost and money won there. And this was actually blocked by major science integrity scientists like Elizabeth Bick. She blocked about it, Retraction Watch, NPR funded Retraction Watch actually wrote about"

So I wrote this piece about, basically called Beware of Alternative Medicine. I'll link it from the show notes and spoke out against homeopathy and Ayurveda. And in the end, I had something about how the Ministry of Ayurveda should not exist, which I do strongly feel. It's a ministry of quackery. And the Ministry of Ayush, I don't know if it's a great honor or something, but the Ministry of Ayush then came out with a press release complaining against my article and demanding that Times of India and I apologize. And my editor there called me in laughing and said, what do we do? And I said, listen, I am happy to double down, never apologizing for that. So nothing of that's what happened. But you know, for a ministry to come out with a press release against an individual article in a newspaper seemed to me just nuts. But what you told me when we were chatting in the break is that the Times of India reporter who covered your first study, just covered your study said that so and so has a study out and this is what it says. She had to go to court along with the Times of India because she got harassed and sued. Yeah, by the Ministry of Ayush. By the Ministry of Ayush."

        "message": "on here? I think the most important aspect is that the Ministry of Ayush, I think we need a ministry like that. For example, in the US, they have a National Center for Complementary Interrogative Medicine, NCCIM. They regulate, for example, if they actually find out that a particular herb or a herbal supplement or a herbal or dietary supplement is actually causing harm to the patient population or a general population, they bring out statements saying that, you know, beware, at your risk, this is not evaluated by the FDA, this is shown to cause problems. So please beware. And you set your risk. But what our ministry is actually, our ministry is supposed to do that, Ayush Ministry is supposed to regulate. But what they're doing is that they have completely forgotten about regulation and they're doing promotion. So they are there, just there to promote Indian medicine, Indian traditional medicine. And they have actually brought everything into that umbrella term Ayush and promoting everything. And if they actually, if I say that or you say that something is harmful and that part, that is directly related to an Ayush practice. If they also say, yeah, it is harmful, then it's directly saying that, you know, you cannot promote it. So every time they're doing promotion, it's against their promotional values. A classical example is when the COVID pandemic was at its peak, Ayush Ministry actually brought out guidelines for treating COVID, which is one of the most hilarious things I've ever read in my life. And in that they actually mentioned that people should take Giloy Khata, lot of Giloy decoctions to prevent Corona, this thing, infection. Very interestingly, a group of doctors from Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, headed by Professor Abha Nagral, they identified initially six patients who developed severe Giloy liver injury and they attributed it to some components in Giloy, which can act, known as furanoditerpenoids. I mean, people say that modern medicine is chemical, but they don't think, they don't, they don't realize that everything is chemicals."

And the injuries in a very, very unique manner that furanoditerpenoids can actually modulate your immune system. So your immune system loses its ability to identify self, which means it will start attacking you. That is known as autoimmune, autoimmune disease. So you lose, your immune cells start attacking your organs. So that particular attack comes in the liver. So that is Giloy induced autoimmune like hepatitis. So Giloy, this group found out that if you take Giloy as recommended, some patients can actually get autoimmune liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis. And those who already have autoimmune disorders, like for example, diabetes or thyroid disease or rheumatoid arthritis, these are all autoimmune diseases, right? So if somebody who has already has a risk of autoimmune disease and they take Giloy, they have a higher risk of developing autoimmune hepatitis with Giloy. This was published. IH ministry brought out a, it's so funny, I mean, I don't know how they can do that. They brought out a big press conference saying that the study is fake. This study was actually published in a peer-reviewed journal, you know, under the Indian National Association of Study of Liver, Inasal is the biggest national society for liver management in the country. And they called that study a fake and said that this is misleading. So me and a lot of my colleagues were actually discussing about this. And we just started talking about Giloy. And I said, you know, I have seen like three or four cases of Giloy. And my colleagues started saying that, you know, he has seen eight, another colleague has seen four. So I said, why don't you guys publish it? He said, like, I mean, we don't know how to go about it. So what we did was we created this group called the Liver Research Club of India, Liverachi. And 13 hospitals participated in that. And we published the largest series of Giloy liver injury from the country, from all regions. And that was published in Hepatology Communications, which is an official journal of American Association of Study of Liver Disease. That was like a nail on the coffin for the Ayush industry. A lot of papers ran because it's not just about six patients now, it's now much more. We are getting so many patients from different parts of the country having Giloy liver injury. We brought out a lot of media wrote about it. I think the Wire Science wrote the best part of it. Banjot Kaur, she wrote a really good article on it about Giloy liver injury. And this was out in the open now. Still Ayush got a statement saying that this is misleading, fake information. I mean, what they should have done is ideally tell people that at least people who have some autoimmune disease process, please avoid Giloy. That's it. That's all they're required to do. That is regulation. Right. But if they do that, the problem is almost 70 to 80 percent of Ayurvedic products contain Giloy, which means all of these products will come under the blacklisting. They can never do that because they are going to lose a lot of businesses because Ayush Ministry, I think, has to take care of stakeholders concerns also. So we have a lot of private and public Ayush industries running and everybody's products will be under the scanner. If somebody says that, you know, Giloy is dangerous, please don't take it. It can cause autoimmune hepatitis. That means a lot of Giloy products will be off the shelves. People will stop using it if they make a statement like that, which is why I think Ayush to protect their stakeholders in the best of interest of business does this. That is why they behave like that. And I think it is still to do with the business only. And they look at the stakeholders part, but not the public health part."

We do a lot of herbal and herbal-related toxicology analysis also. My department and my unit does that. So I get a lot of referrals from other hospitals and other people also. I mean, so I see a lot more patients than what other people may be seeing, other doctors may be seeing. Even then, during the COVID time, I used to see about five to six new cases a week of herbal liver injury, including homeopathy and Siddha and everything. And now it has come down to three. I mean, last week I saw three patients with herbal and homeopathy liver injury, which is actually a lot because if you look at it per month, it's somewhere around 12 cases, 15 cases of patients who should not have been patients in the first place. This is just added disease burden, added health burden to the community. You can just avoid all of it. You can avoid all this resource utilization, all this financial burden from the patient. Some of them even land up in liver transplant, 20 to 25 lakhs. So much of unnecessary spending on it. And this is just the tip of the iceberg that I see. If every doctor in the periphery, in every doctor in an institute with a proper department to look into adverse drug reactions from complementary and alternative medicines does this, I think these numbers will be much, much higher. It will be much higher because if you look at data coming out from the US and Asia Pacific per se, the number one cause of something known as acute or chronic liver failure, that is already patients have stable liver disease, they have underlying pre-existing liver disease and suddenly they develop liver failure. The number one cause of such acute and chronic liver failure initially was anti-tuberculosis drugs. We have a lot of TB patients. We treat them. Some of them develop TB-related liver injury, anti-TB drugs-related liver injury. Now the number one cause is complementary and alternative medicine in Asia Pacific. So that is there. It is emerging. So if actually if you look at it from an Indian perspective, what I am seeing is just the tip of the iceberg."

If you split it, like MBBS is one exam and Ayush is another exam, I'm sure nobody will go there to give separate Ayush exams to get into Ayush medical colleges. I see. Right. So it is very different. So it's a single exam. And based on your rank, you go for Ayush or MBBS. So if you split it, a lot of things will change. Another thing is that if you actually do a bachelor's in homeopathy or bachelor's in Ayurveda in Kerala, you have a reservation quota for MBBS."

        "message": "Yeah. And I think one of my I mean, the one of my main clinical research associate that I work with, Dr. Arif, he was a homeopath. He's an ex homeopath. He studied, I mean, he practiced for almost 10 years homeopathy and left it because he understood it is pseudoscience. Now he's doing very good clinical research in my in my unit. And he was telling me that there is a reservation system for alternative medicine. So if you do a BHMS or BAMS, if you give a NEET exam next time, you'll have preference over another general category student for getting into MBBS. That is what makes people go for integrative medicine. So you do both MBBS and BHMS or MBBS and BAMS and they practice worst of both and end up doing bad for the patient. So this integrative medicine thing is also coming up. So we have a lot of medical colleges, I mean, catering to I mean, I won't call it the medical colleges, but colleges catering to Ayurveda and homeopathy and even Siddha and naturopathy also are courses that are coming up and Unani, a lot of them. Now the biggest part of this is that after they complete their training, their training actually involves both. So if you look at the curriculum in BAMS and BHMS, there are modern medicine subjects in that. You cannot learn anatomy and physiology from classical Ayurvedic texts because in classical Ayurveda, they say that heart is a single chamber with a lot of vessels going around it like tentacles and supplying every part of the body. I mean, we know that William Harvey identified the real circulation and it is not like what is in Ayurveda. So you can't teach them that. Ayurveda says, I think there are more than 360 bones in the body, according to Ayurvedic this thing, which is wrong. So what they do is they teach them proper physiology, anatomy and biochemistry and everything and surgical methods and everything. And then they ask the students to go and treat them the Ayurvedic way. So when I spoke to some of these Ayurveda students who are, I won't say harassing me, but responding rather rudely to me on Twitter, they are saying that you have only studied allopathy, which is not right. I mean, I've studied scientific medicine. You have studied only scientific medicine. But in Ayurvedic course, we are studying both, we are studying Ayurveda and scientific medicine. So we have best of both worlds. I mean, see the wrong impressions that these students have. They study actual modern medicine. Their question papers actually have modern medicine questions, like, for example, what is migraine? How do you treat migraine? And the next question will be, how do you treat unmadha? You know, unmadha is basically mania in Ayurveda. And you should read the chapter where they say that the patient should be put in a well and then scared with snakes and dogs and all that and then beaten up and all that. That is how it is written in Ayurveda, treatment of mania. We know that is not how you treat mania. So you have a mix of both. So you people are so confused. Students are so confused about what is right and what is wrong, because the syllabus itself is completely wrong. Even in homeopathy, they teach homeopathic pharmacology, which is that dilution thing, but they teach proper disease conditions. For example, they talk, they learn about infections when homeopathy has no germ theory, even Ayurveda has no germ theory, but they talk about infections, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and then they ask them to treat with this diluted stuff. I mean, it's so confusing for the student. So the whole course pattern itself is so wrong. If they actually convert the whole thing into modern medicine pattern, I mean, I think we would have more doctors to serve more patients instead of these half big practitioners that come out of these courses. And the whole thing about bridge courses, now that's something that the government was planning to do, is that BAMS and BHMS candidates can actually do some six months course in a private or a public hospital and then start practicing as a general physician or an MBBS level graduate, which is actually even worse because they don't know the basics of pharmacology, biochemistry, anatomy, physiology properly to apply it in a patient population. So converting them directly into doctors, it's not a good thing. Second aspect is like what you said, we can actually have them as paramedical. For example, take them completely out of their practice and teach them a particular paraclinic or a paramedical or a biomedical course, and then make them go into that. That's actually a brilliant thing to do. A lot of these Ayurveda and homeopathy doctors also do to get out of their courses, they actually do masters in hospital administration, and then they start doing entrepreneurship and things like that. They don't practice at all. So I have an Ayurveda graduate who's working with me now in my clinical research department. I have a homeopath and an Ayurveda practitioner, and she's actually fully into clinical research work. She stopped her practice now. And now they are doing a course on bioethics and all that. So they are doing additional courses and trying to get into the administrative and clinical research part of real clinical medicine. So that can be done, but directly making them in charge of treating actual real patient force with a small bridge course, I don't think it works. Because it took me 15 to 16 years to finish my medicine, and then another five years to actually understand how to deal with patients. So how can somebody just do a bridge course in six months and become a doctor suddenly after passing homeopathy and Ayurveda? So that conversion also should be practical. And it has to be either clinical research based, research associate based, hospital administration, paramedical, paraclinical or biomedical."

A new thing that I have seen is that a lot of these Ayurveda graduates, what they do is they have now started on full on on Instagram, Instagram has now become a cesspool of alternative medicine practitioners. It's a cesspool. A lot of Ayurveda practitioners start giving out nutritional advice and a lot of things like that. And people just fall for it. I mean, people love such generalized stuff, generic stuff, nutrition and how to take care of your hair, how to grow your fingers longer. And what they do is along with that, they'll slowly start a supplements selling industry. So you'll have another page of theirs where they will be selling some supplements. And this has now become the new stuff that these Ayurveda and homeopath practitioners do. Homeopaths do something additional. So they'll have their clinic and attached to the clinic, they will have a medical shop, a pharmacy shop. You just need a single license, medical license, I mean, pharmaceutical license to sell both types of drugs as per the current rule. So they'll have modern medicines and also homeopathic medicines in that. And what is going to be selling is all modern medicines. So they'll be sitting in their homeopathic clinic and prescribing modern medicines, which the patients will be taking. So this is another trend that is coming up. I mean, it's nothing they have studied at all. It's just messed up, completely messed up. And social media is just adding fuel to the fire."

You said they give a single MBBS exam, and because they can't get into a proper medical college, they end up going for these. And therefore, it strikes me that then the fundamental core problem here is an undersupply of medical education. Because what I would rather have is many more medical colleges, fine, maybe these people came at the bottom of the exam, and you feel they aren't smart or whatever, which is not always the case, because even passing an exam is a particular skill.

And that is where a lot of them get fizzled out and they go into these Ayush related streams. Another aspect is that not just the lack of infrastructure and seats or a lack of medical seats, there are some students who really want to do Ayurveda or homeopathy, and that is because of legacy. So there are these big Ayurveda based families in Kerala and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and all. They have a legacy. They are like 6th and 7th generation of Ayurveda practitioner, they'll have a business to run and all that. So based on that, some of them actually opt for Ayurveda and homeopathy to run their business.

Because working in a peripheral set up in a rural area, I mean, doctors don't want to do that now in India, because I mean, it's it's it's quite poor, I think, except maybe a few states or maybe a few regions in some states, the rural practice is not a dream practice for a lot of doctors. Because the one is they struggle to get into MBBS, two is they struggle to get out of MBBS. Three is they struggle to get into post graduation. And if you want them to go work in a rural set up for peanuts, nobody's going to do it with basic setup. They actually want to work to the best extent for the patient. For example, if I go sit in a rural primary health care center, what am I going to do? Because I am trained to manage patients who have undergone post who have undergone transplants. I mean, I'm trained to manage patients who are critically ill in the ICU, critically ill cirrhosis management also I've been trained. If I go sit in a PHC, fever patients will come, arthritis patients will come, or if a liver patient actually comes, I won't be able to do anything much for them. I'll have to refer them to some other place. So the kind of work that I'm trained in and the kind of work output that I'm going to do in a rural setup is completely mismatched. Otherwise, government should make sure that post MBBS or family medicine doctors are there MD, family medicine, which are very good, very good category of doctors that we can actually promote to take care of the rural and suburban area as well. They should actually improve conditions and infrastructure for them to actually work and improve patient care in these areas. So it's not like a super specialist has to go and work there. You can actually have these group of doctors who are trained to work in such situations go and work there. But even that is not happening here. That is why patients in those areas, they mostly go and get, you know, treatments from alternative medicine practitioners. And the best part is most of the alternative medicine practitioners who go work there, they prescribe modern medicines, you know, they don't, they don't prescribe their kind of practice there. And that actually harms the patient more, you know, they just maybe prescribe antibiotics for a viral infection, which then antibiotics should be used for a bacterial infection. And they prescribe unnecessary painkillers and the patients land up in more trouble."

Equally, even I remember when I wrote my piece, in fact, a lot of the online trolling for that quite apart from the Ministry of Ayush complaint was actually not from Ayurveda people, it was all from homeopaths and very vociferous, very abusive, it was just horrible. And although I've gotten mobbed often by all kinds of people, and they're all horrible. So my question is this, that what is the environment for the scientific temperament in India? Because when we look back to our past as an independent nation, you know, I often keep talking about how you had a bunch of elites who were ruling the country who tried to rule it in a top down way. And they thought they can spread their values in a top down way, the liberal, liberal tolerant values and they couldn't quite manage. And we are seeing that today that in a sense, politics has caught up with society. And equally, I worry that we talk of scientific temperament, we talk of setting up IITs and all of that, which are great achievements in their domains. But the scientific temperament is not something widespread at all. And I am not optimistic. When I look around me, when I look at the kind of harassment that you have to deal with, when I look at when you tell me the story of your team member having to relocate to leave the country, because of harassment, it doesn't make me very optimistic. So give me a sense of, you know, what is the environment? What gives you hope? Do you think that there is progress happening? You know, do you think you know, where do you see that progress coming from? You know, is there light at the end of a tunnel or is it the torch of a serial killer?"

Because that senior pathologist has specifically asked me not to put her name. Because she does not want the harassment to happen to her. So that part is also there. So if you see the last three or four papers we published in Ayurveda and homeopathy, there is no pathologist name in that. It's quite sad. So that that was an extra point. So coming to this aspect of scientific temperament, you know, I don't think I mean, we should just talk about or blame the common person or the layperson about lack of scientific temperament. This is deeply, deeply ingrained, even in the doctor community, the lack of scientific temperament. For example, when I spoke about when I speak about turmeric, or Ayurvedic product or homeopathy product being not useful, apart from the common people who actually come with defenses or harassment towards me, I was shocked to see I mean, first time I'm seeing that shocked to see oncologist, cardiologist, cellular biologists and all attacking me on my statements.

I mean, he's a cancer surgeon for God's sake. I mean, that's like one of the highest levels of medical medical science that you can do. And these are the people who are, you know, defending an alternative medicine industry. So I think the scientific temperament does not mean that you know, you're just trained in science or you're educated and you have an MD degree or an MS degree or a DM degree, it means that you are able to think rationally and logically, without any obstacles from your traditional religious or cultural values. You know, you need to you need to have that power to separate both. Like I never talk about religion or I never quote religion or cultural matters or anything. I never even discuss that stuff.

But these doctors, when they they are actual doctors, they're not even doctors. These doctors, when they actually come to defend Ayurveda or homeopathy, they quote traditional cultural and religious stuff, not scientific stuff, just like a layperson talking.

And also, once you enter the college also, I mean, for example, now everything is going upside down. For example, like you asked me, is there any hope? If you ask me today, I would say things are really bad because what they're doing is they are now mixing Ayush related stuff into MBBS curriculum. Just yesterday, an MBBS student forwarded me a question paper which was asked during their first terminal exam. And it had a question saying that provide the physiology aspects of yoga in cardiac and cardiac physiology and something, something. I mean, come on. That's not a question that you should be asking an MBBS student when yoga aspects of cardiac physiology and all. If yoga is something that is very close to Indians, just like turmeric. And when I say that yoga is a pseudoscience, most of the people don't agree with me because they don't know what yoga principles actually are. Yoga principles are actually pseudoscientific principles. The bindu and the chakras, everything are imaginary stuff. And when such questions are being included in a proper question paper, students will realize that, I mean, students will erroneously realize that, you know, okay, these are also maybe important stuff. And they actually will have, you know, I won't say best of both worlds, but they'll learn about Ayush and they'll learn about modern medicine also. And same thing is happening to Ayush candidates now. They are learning modern medicine and their textbooks in detail. But that's that slight percolation of pseudoscientific teaching is now slowly coming into our proper mainstream literature, mainstream teaching also. This is not a good sign at all, because I have no idea where this is going to end. Because you are going to have a lot of half-baked bitter students coming out of these colleges. And when you talk to them about Ayurveda or homeopathy or yoga, they will exactly behave like the homeopaths are behaving now. And they're supposed to be the real doctors who only take care of our public health.

And equally, there are patients who have they had access to proper doctors would not go for this quackery. But what you're pointing to now is that the problem is more deep rooted than that. Even people who have studied the science, even people who, you know, cancer oncologists will also, you know, find something in this, which is, which is kind of scary. So what, you know, in your small way, you fight every single day against this kind of misinformation and against this kind of bad science, as it were, and you're carrying on the good fight. But in general, how do you feel civil society can counter this? Because a counter is not going to come from a ministry, the counter is not really going to come from even our medical colleges, if our, you know, MBBS syllabi is dictated in this way. The counter may not even come from the scientific community per se, if many of them will believe this. But if determined people within civil society say that, look, we got to solve this problem, we got to do something about it, you know, what are the possible ways in which we can"

        "message": "So one thing that I have noted is that when I started this, started talking about science and pseudoscience about maybe three years back, I used to always get I mean, the majority of the responses that used to get were either abuses, harassment or troll. I never used to have any positive stuff regarding what I was tweeting at the time. But now when I look at, if you look at the tweets and the responses, you'll see that a lot of common people, a lot of, you know, engineers and computer engineers, and you know, lawyers and police officers, I mean, people who are have no idea about the medical field completely non medicos, they come in support of scientific medicine, they come in support of my statements, and this is something brilliant that I've seen. So the whole aspect is to change the mindset of the general people that actually will change the choices that they will they will make for their children. So for example, if maybe about five, six years back, if somebody says that, you know, I did not get into MBBS, what should I do, daddy and mommy, what should I do? They'll, shall I take homeopathy or Ayurveda? They'll say, yeah, take it because you'll become a doctor anyway. So you take it. So that is, that was the thought process at that time, but now, if we keep on talking about science and pseudoscience, and how only scientific medicine and a science based approach can improve a community and a nation, and people actually imbibe that, if that question comes again, so one of these kids of one of these people who are now scientifically enlightened, if they ask, shall I take homeopathy, they'll say no, don't take homeopathy, go for veterinary medicine, or go for biomedical science, go for physics or biochemistry, either those are scientific streams, you don't have to become a doctor to contribute scientifically to the community, there are so many other options. So they will start looking for those options. And that way, when the demand comes down, I think slowly and steadily, our community will become better from a scientific temperament point of view. So I don't think there is any point in trying to modulate or, you know, influence politicians or the ministry, or even these institutions, because all of these institutions are now, I mean, they are completely under the control of whatever this governance wants them to. A classical example is, it's very, it's quite sad, Nimhans in Bangalore, has a separate wing for Ayurveda and yoga completely. So a colleague of mine actually went there to show a doctor, a neurologist, and everybody who goes in there has to go through an Ayurveda and a yoga practitioner also, like it's become mandatory. He was telling me he was examined by the neurologist and everything. He wrote some tests, and he wrote some medication, he asked them to go to the next room. So he went to the next room, and there was an Ayurveda guy sitting there. And he's asking them questions and asking him, yeah, telling them stuff to do and things like that. So that has become integrated now."

And then the yoga guy prescribed him some yoga posters and things like that for his brain disease and things like that. Complete nonsense. It's become totally integrated now into the main mainstream. So these things are happening in the main institutes. And I think a lot of money is also being pumped into these institutes for Ayush related research. Lot of it. And instead of really doing proper research, Ayush based research has now become a big deal in most of the central institutes. Even IIT. They're all doing a lot of work for Ayush. CSIR is doing a lot of product development for Ayush. AIMS is doing active Ayush. I was visiting AIMS in Bhubaneswar. They were actually doing a study on constipation and yoga intervention. Come on, you just take a Dulcolax, your constipation is gone. Why do you need yoga for that? Or treat the cause of constipation. It's hypothyroidism. You treat for thyroid disease, your constipation is gone. Instead of that, they're making patients do all these asanas and all that and seeing if constipation gets relieved. What a waste of time and money. All this is happening in central institutes now, which is quite sad."

Those people can't even know the root cause because their whole foundation is so demonstrably crazy, like in the wonderful video you did with Krish Ashok, you also pointed out about other aspects of Ayurveda, which are demonstrably false, like, you know, quite apart from Vata, Pitta, Kapha, having no basis in science.

And I wish more and more people do this, because what I have realized is that it'll spread through society when good people are silent. And too often we find this, we'll go online. And too often I'll agree with someone on Twitter, but I'll think to myself that hey, if I actually comment, you know, people will mob me, I'll get into trouble. We stop ourselves like that. And I would just like to request everyone listening to this that one, of course, you got to follow Abby on Twitter. But every time he puts out a tweet that you agree with, amplify it either comment or retweet it and you know, good people should not be silent when there is so much at stake. This is a this is a health issue for God's sake, you know, it's when there is so much at stake. So, you know, you've given me a lot of your time and I want to thank you for that. But before I do, I'm going to ask you for a little bit more of your time, because my tradition at the end of my episodes is to ask my guests for recommendations of what kind of books, music, films they really enjoy and would want to share with the world. And and I'm going to start with graphic novels, because you're a fan of them as am I."

        "message": "Just. It's just brilliant. I mean, I mean, I can't explain it. It's so nice. It's so soothing. The second one would be I'm not sure if people have read this. It's called Rosalie Lightning. It's by Tom Hart. It's about a parent to I mean, a couple losing their child to sudden death syndrome. And I mean, I mean, I mean, the listeners would think that I'm such a depressed, I mean, depressive, tragic kind of guy, because a lot of books that I read are to do with a lot of tragedies. I think that's partly because I've been molded that way. My mind is molded that way because the kind of patients I see and the kind of work that I do every day, I try to look for bittersweet things in, you know, in real tragedy. So these books stick with me. And another book that I love is it's supposedly a children's book, but I think it's it's it's more than that. I'm not sure if you've heard of it. It's called Robot Dreams. Robot Dreams is about losing something and then finding it, but then still having that lingering feeling that you have lost it. Wow. Right. So that happens with me and my patients. When I see a patient who is supposed to actually die and, you know, he improves. And then I don't know what goes on. You cannot actually you know, you cannot actually predict anything when it comes to health. That is one part of medical science that, you know, you're nobody to speak on what is going to happen to you or what is going to happen to your patients. You can you can never predict it. So patients who actually improve and then suddenly you lose them. For example, I've had patients who have fought severe liver disease, came out of it doing so well. And then six months later, eight months later, they come with a severe bleed. So we call it as a variceal bleed. That is when it happens in cirrhosis where you have large vessels in the foot pipe and they burst because your liver is cirrhotic and you you vomit blood and exsanguinate and die. And some of them come with such torrential bleed. You cannot you can't do anything because when you do an endoscopy, you just see a blood field. You can't even identify the source to control it. And they die in front of you. And they were doing so well. And you suddenly lose them. And and it's like that, you know, you you you won the battle, but then you you lost it at the end. But that feeling of winning is there. But then you have lost it also, right? So these books actually give me that kind of sense. That is why I love these books. And I keep them very close to me. And another book that I would recommend is Maus. Brilliant. Yeah. Maus is a book that it strikes."

But my God, that's like a really mature book. It has so many sub stories in it, and it's brilliant. I love that book, Bone. And then I would say from a literature point of view, a graphic novel that is very close to me and I just love it is V for Vendetta. Just brilliant. I mean, these are the graphic novels that I love. I have a lot of Marvel and DC comics, but I won't mention them here because they're just entertainment value. But these are some serious books that I relate to in my practice. I mean, in my in my profession and career, because they're all bittersweet and tragic at the same time. So these are the books that I love. Movies. One movie that is very, very, I mean, something that changed. I never knew that movies can affect you. I mean, this is the movie that actually when I actually saw it, I had this feeling that I mean, movies you see for entertainment, you know, you don't get affected by it. That is how it was all the while. But this movie started affecting me. And that is when I said that movies are so powerful that it can challenge your emotions. Cinema Paradiso is a movie that I just love. It is so fantastic. And on the same lines, so many movies are there, which I love. But I cannot, I mean, give I mean, make a huge list out here. So I'm just thinking the good ones that I've seen."

One is the series called The Night Of. It's a brilliant series. It's on Hotstar. I think everybody should watch it, The Night Of. And there is this series called True Detective Season One. That's superb. Wow. Mind-blowing. So these are the ones that directly come to my mind. So when it comes to music, I am very old school. I love the 70s and 80s music. So I am completely into Pink Floyd, Def Leppard, Metallica. So basically I love the power ballads. I don't like the heavy metal part. I love power ballads. And I love soft rock and rock ballads. So I love a lot of Bon Jovi. I love Man O' War. I'm not sure if people have heard about all this. I love this group called Savataj. They have a song called Sleep. I'm telling you, if you listen to that, you will definitely sleep off. It is so soothing. It's one of the best songs I've heard. Savataj. Sleep by Savataj. And another song that I really love is songs by Sting And The Police. I love their songs. And then, you know, the classic Cyndi Lauper, the classic 70s and 80s.

I mean, I always wanted to write a book because I love writing literature, especially medical literature. But I never expected this to come so soon. And this this actually happened because the type of tweet that I do, I have a long form tutorial, where I talk about a particular patient case and how we came to a diagnosis of that patient through, you know, it's a kind of storytelling mode that I do on Twitter. It's like a long thread form. And I think I did about 20 of those long thread forms which I've collected in my on my profile in Twitter. And I think I got a lot of good response from my followers and friends on that. And I got two or three offers from various publishers asking me if I would like to make this kind of work into a proper book, which will actually look into, you know, hepatology person because as my handling publisher, I mean, the editor told me, you know, you have books on brain, you have books on heart, you have books on gut, you know, they all sound so sexy, but we have no books on the liver. So and the liver aspect of patient management and care is much more intense than what we actually see in the other books. And so this has to be there. So they said that, you know, you have to write a book on it and it has to be on hepatology based purely on your patient care and, you know, patient related stories. And through those stories, you will teach the common man what hepatology is and how the practice of hepatology is from the past to the present. So this is a huge project. So I think probably I'll, I'm going to look at 1.25 lakh words, about 400 pages, and hopefully I'll finish it in the right time, maybe within a year. And I currently what I'm doing is when I when I have a mood for writing that kind of, you know, stuff, I do that and there is no timing to that. So if I'm sitting in the OPD, and I get an idea about one particular section, I just make a note on it. And then I go back home and I write that paragraph, or if I'm sitting at home, and I get some ideas on it, and my kids are asleep, and everybody, everything is settled. I spend some time alone, maybe an hour or half, possibly two or three days a week and then keep writing. So I've not fully started on it yet. But I've started and probably I have completed 16 pages of 400 pages."
