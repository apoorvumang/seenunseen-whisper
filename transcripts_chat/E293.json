        "message": "The philosopher Thomas Nagel once wrote an essay called What is it like to be a bat? One of the arguments in that essay was that even if a human could try and imagine what it was like to be a bat by taking the bat's point of view, it is impossible to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat. If you wrote an essay called What is it like to be a woman, men would be in a similar situation. Our powers of empathy and imagination can only get us so far. We are mostly blind to the many ways in which women have to adapt to live in a world designed by men, for men. And so much have we normalized this, that even many women take it for granted. What is it like to be a woman in a world where hotel rooms don't have latches on the inside, where offices don't have enough women's toilets, where workplaces don't account for periods or pregnancies, where the men are all raja betas and the women are grocery lists trapped in human bodies, as my guest today wrote, where you aren't taken seriously, you are interrupted all the time. And Fufaji is a bigot. All these extra layers of life that men just don't have to deal with, they need to be documented. Someone needs to write about what it's like to be womaning in India. Somebody is."

        "message": "Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to the scene in the unseen. My guest today is Mahima Vashisht, a former civil servant who runs a phenomenal newsletter, Womaning in India. Mahima did my writing course a couple of years ago, and at the end of the course asked for my advice on writing. We did a zoom call and she told me about an idea she had for a book to write about those aspects of women's lives that men had no clue about. I suggested that the best way to get the ball rolling was not to write a book straight away, for that can be a daunting project, but to start a weekly newsletter. So she did, and Womaning in India has now gathered a cult following. She's built a tremendous body of work documenting what women go through in the workplace, in public spaces, in their homes and in their own heads. She's spoken to countless women across this country, gathered their stories and illuminated a world that many men, even well-meaning men, would have been clueless about. So I figured I'd get her on the show to talk about her life, her work and Womaning in India. But first, let's go to a unique kind of commercial break, Capital Gyaan by Deepak Shannoy. This is like a show within a commercial from the kind sponsors of this episode, Capital Mind."

        "message": "Yeah, I've listened to a lot of episodes of your podcast and always wondered that how how are people's lives so interesting, like people are reading books in in beside rivers flowing behind their homes and all and I always felt like my upbringing was very, very average by those standards. But but we'll go there anyway. So I'm basically from a partition refugee family. My paternal grandparents were children or young adults when partition happened. And so both of my Dada and Dadi have, they've told us stories about how they went through it. My grandfather was in Xavier's Mumbai when partition happened and he was studying engineering there. And so his family was stuck beside beyond the border and he was here in India. And so there was all of that anxiety in those days with no communication channel, whether your loved ones are even okay, whether they're even alive. My grandmother had this very, very, that in Hindi you say dil dehla dene wali story of how they were. She was one of 14 siblings. They were all children. They had a house in Lahore and there was a warehouse like go down under their house and wahan pe they used to store bade bade bartano mein wheat and rice and things like that. So how they as children hid inside those huge containers because the houses were being homes were being raided and there were riots in the streets, of course, and Hindus are not safe there. Muslims are not safe here. And so they hid in those gigantic containers for a week, 10 days, and they lived on eating those raw grains of wheat and rice. That's how they survived it. And then, you know, suddenly news would come, ke ek train jaa rahi hai, chalo. And aadi raat ko some children are going in one batch, some are going in the other. And again, you don't know whether you're being separated from your siblings. You don't know whether you'll even see them again. So so very, very shocking, disturbing stories from there. Then they came to Delhi and they settled here in a in a refugee colony. I believe my grandmother was elsewhere and later when she got married, she moved in obviously with my grandfather. And my great grandmother was the matriarch of the family at the time. I remember my dad still tells me the story of how at that time, you know, these refugee colonies were being offered and unko koi, I don't know, a defense colony, ya kahin Kalka ji kahin pe, she was getting a house. And at that time, Delhi mein, it was like she, she literally refused that house saying wahan jangal mein jaa ke kaun rahega. And today my dad is like, if she had said yes at that time, our lives would have been very different right now. But anyway, so then she, so then she came, moved here with my grandfather who had one sibling, my grandmother who had 13 siblings. And then they got married, they had four sons, one of, third one was my father. My mother's side again, four siblings, third one was my mother. My mom's side is another interesting story of great struggle, I think. So my mom's mother was again one of just two siblings, because my mom's grandfather passed away very soon after his marriage to my great grandmother on that side, my great nani on that side. And I think it was a Spanish flu or something at that time, which took a lot of lives and many young adults passed away suddenly. And so many families were left with no parents or single parents. And so my great nani was suddenly widowed at a very young age, she had two children and she self educated herself and became actually a school principal, which at that time did not take like a huge amount of education. But even with basic education, you could become that. And so she was a self made woman in that era, a woman who was in a job earning and raising a family on her own, which was very, very admirable. And then my nani had actually had nine children, which I found out much later in life, that my mom had had five siblings who never made it beyond the first year of their life. So I mean, when I think about it, I can't imagine how a parent, a mother says especially goes on after losing five children and then going on to have more children. But that was I guess the way of those times, you know, it was just a fact of life that some children will not make it. I mean, very common diseases like diarrhea and all, which today utterly preventable, you take ORS, you will be fine. At that time, children would actually lose lives and parents would lose children to that. Anyway, so then after somehow, luckily after number six, she had four children who made it and then my mom was the third of those four. So I much later in life found out that my mom was actually number nine, not nine, seven, eight. Yes, we'll have to edit this. So much later in life, I found out my mom was not the third child, she was actually the eighth child in that family. So yeah, then my parents, my dad, I think had his initial years of his education in Kanpur, and then they moved back to Delhi, because my dadaji was an engineer and he used to work in these repair of theatre equipment. So there was a lot of travelling, because at that time in India, there were only so many, single screen obviously, and there were very few of those. So he used to travel a lot, be on tour a lot. And so my dadi used to stay in Delhi at home with her, with the four boys. I think both my parents had very humble beginnings, that way, I studied in a government school and Hindi medium, they tell me stories of, you know, sitting on the floor in a broken tent, and teachers are obviously not interested, and very few who would actually have a stake in teaching at all, mostly just going through the motions. But then they were, both of them had this very strong work ethic and this strong desire to love for education. So they kind of, again, were self-taught in a way. My father ended up doing an MA in English, having come from a Hindi medium school, almost overnight taught himself English. By reading the dictionary, like that's how he would tell me that he would read a sentence and then come across four new words in that sentence, and then go back to the dictionary and look up their meaning and then read the next sentence. So that's an intense amount of work to put into learning a language, but that's how, that's how he did it. And he went on to do an MA in English. My mom also did a master's later in life and was a BA in the, when they got married. They got married in 1985, and that's the year later that year I was born. And then two years later, I had a younger brother. I don't remember much from my early years, but I mostly grew up in Delhi. And my parents were, like I said, you know, great love for education and despite humble beginnings and both of them were bankers for most of my life. They were in public sector banks and again transferable jobs. So we used to change schools a lot, even within Delhi. So in my life, in the 12 years of schooling, I've changed 10 schools. So that's a significant amount of nomadic lifestyle to have. But that was, I think it was good in hindsight and it was a little tough at that time maybe, but it was, it was good. I mean, it made me very comfortable and adjustable. I would make friends easily. I would settle in new circumstances easily. And they used to, I mean, we went to the best of the schools, my brother and I. My parents, again, like I said, love for education. So that was very important to them. It was a very important ethic that they built into us also that, you know, one is a love for education. And the other thing that they probably didn't teach us consciously, but we picked up was value for money. Because somehow, I don't, they never said it to us, but at least for me, I imbibed it quite early in life that they are not, it's not easy for them to send me to this school. They are making sacrifices and the least I can do is study well. So I used to be like class topper all through school and everything, very, very boring, typical Delhi type story. And we used to have all these holidays, these classes, so we also became a bit of jack of all trades. We learned a bit of dancing, a bit of Bhadrat Natyam, a bit of Kathak, a bit of singing, a bit of painting, a bit of this and that. Like we would be shunted out of the house during summer. So kind of picked up a lot of things alongside education, alongside academics early in life. And then I think the big, I mean, it must have been skipping a lot of things here, but I think the next big milestone happened in our lives when I was in 10th standard. I mean, in Delhi, it starts after 9th, no more going downstairs to play, less of friends, now focus on studies, the year of the board exam is coming, so prepare for 10th in 9th, write the board in 10th, then prepare for 12th in 11th, then write the board in 12th. So that is basically, and the story you were told was that if you study these two years, then your life is set. Of course, that story carries on later also, that if you do this entrance, then your life is set. Then if you write that exam, then your life is set. That goes on, but at that time, obviously, you are children and you fall for this, fall for this pitch. So we, so I was like very hardcore 10th is like, this is the do or die year of life. And in that year, some leadership change happened in my mom's bank. And until that time, they had a policy of not transferring women, because they were like working mothers have it tough enough as it is, let's not make life worse for them. Already the husbands are moving around, and they have to adjust with that. A lot of years, I grew up with my dad living in some village in UP, and then commuting every week to come see us. Aisa hota tha bahut. So my mom was like the one fixture ke theek hai, she is going to be in Delhi, she is going to be in this house. So we don't have to change schools as often. But then that year, when I was in 10th, there was a leadership change in her organization. And the man who came in was, was for some reason had a bone to pick with women. He said, transfer all the women, bahut ho gaya, baithi hoon hi hain kap, ek hi jaga pe. So usne utha ke, sabko, and not even like transfer them locally, from one Delhi office to another, or within departments, no, transfer them to other cities, where they've never been and don't want to go. So my mom was transferred to Ahmedabad. So suddenly, like I said, humara pura plan tha na, ke 9th to 12th, ghar mein cable TV kat jayega, baith ke padhai karni hai. And then the plan got disrupted in the most crucial year. So my dad, to his credit at the time, said that, you know, this is a crucial year for Mahima's education, and we need to keep the family together. Because earlier we went by ourselves, and it was a huge struggle for my mother to manage the new house, new culture, bachchon ke nahi school, her own new office, her own office ka dynamics and politics. It was just too much for her to do by herself. And she would every day tell him, when are you coming here? And so to his huge credit, he took VRS in a year that, it was like quite early in his career at that time. So people would tell him ke, oh, you're making the biggest mistake of your life. And he was like, nahi, my family needs me, and he prioritized that. Again, a very, very, very modern take for a, decision for a man to take at that time, that I will quit my job and my wife will continue to earn, because she doesn't have the option of VRS right now. So she would have to resign and just sit at home with no pay, I will at least get a pension. So theek hai. And I'll do something of my own. So he did that, which was massive, a huge sacrifice for which I'm indebted forever, because again, something that could have changed the direction of our lives completely. So he came and joined us in Ahmedabad, and I suffered a lot in terms of academics and to the extent that a 10th standard child can suffer, basically. Huge culture shift, children in my school suddenly speaking Gujarati and telling me I have a Punjabi accent, which until that time, no one had pointed out because, well, I guess all of us had Punjabi accents, so no one points it out. But then when I go there, they say, oh, the way you say this thing, this is very Punjabi, this is very Delhi type. So I would be very conscious about the way I speak. I was the new kid in a class, in a school where 10th standard was the last class. Toh wo bachche KG se saath mein padhte hua rahe the, and I am suddenly middle of the year, airdropped into this classroom where nobody knows me and nobody cares at this stage of their life to make new friends. So very difficult adjustment, and I was this cocky class topper, teacher's pet in Delhi school, toh Delhi mein my school so far. So I was like completely out of my comfort zone, my marks plummeted and like I said again, the most life-defining crucial do or die year of my life, and my brother was having his own set of issues, he was getting bullied by the boys in his class. And so we had a very difficult adjustment that year. That year also, there was floods in Gujarat, in Ahmedabad, and our school was in a low-lying area. So I remember school ka poora ground floor tak paani bhar gaya, we were all moved to the first floor, and then first floor mein paani bharne lagya. So then some army people came and humko utha, waha se rassi baand ke, nikaal ke leke gaye, and we were evacuated. So that was my first brush with natural disasters. So anyway, lot of stuff happened, and by God's grace or hard work, parents, blessings, everything, I actually ended up topping West India that year. From going from like 68% marks ho gaye the meri, I was this always, 95 se upar rahe na chahiye. 90 bhi nahi, 95 se upar aana chahiye. Maths mein 25 mein se 24 and a half kyun aaye, half mark kahan kata? That was the big, big pain points of my life were those, until that year. From that year, I came down to like academics mein kahi nahi, all, everything changed suddenly, and which was, again, in hindsight, I think it was a change that I needed. It was a reality check that I needed, like I said, I was getting rather comfortable and cocky in Delhi. Toh 10th hua, phir then 11th mein changed into state board, Gujarat board, went there for 10 days and decided ke yeh toh bhai, these textbooks are like 100 pages and I'm not going to, this is not okay. I'm not going to fit in here. So then I got to, came back into central board, Kendra Vidyalaya, then 12th mein ek aur school badla. I did a bit of IIT prep over there, which again, Ahmedabad had no coaching classes or anything at that time. So there was this one class and I remember I went, I joined there, woh nahi nahi khuli thi and I went there, first day I sat next to a boy and I was like, you know, looking for validation, have I come to the right place even? So I asked this guy that, you know, what do you know about this class, why did you choose it? This, and then he was like, this is the best class in Ahmedabad. I said, why? He said, don't you know, Mahima Vashishth comes to this class and I was like, what? Because I had topped West India na, akbaar wagar mein naam chhap gaya tha mera. And then somehow word travelled that I had joined this class. And then I realised that people are here because I am here, I don't know why I am here. So we are all in one boat, sink or swim and basically we sank, that boat sank because I didn't clear IIT. Like I cleared and I got some like 6000 rank or something, which at that time would have given you mining engineering in one, bahut door ka koi college and so that was not it. And then I also gave AIEEE, I also gave medical because I had bio also, lot of, har jagah haath pyaar maara and finally I got into AIEEE ek exam, ussi saal start hua tha, the All-India Engineering Entrance Examination. And until then, that year you had to apply separately to every college you wanted to go into. So if you, there are 50 colleges, big, big league colleges, you have to fill 50 application forms and write 50 exams. So thankfully from my year only it had started and I wrote that exam and I got into an NIT, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. Usse upar rank mein the, uss samay bhi and NIT Surat was local for us, Gujarat mein. And NIT Allahabad, I remember was one of the highest ranked and I could have, with my marks and rank, I could have gotten into it and I remember my parents, we went to that counselling centre jahan pe yeh diya jata hai, aapko yeh branch aur yeh NIT mil raha hai. And waha jaa ke we had applied and the counselling centre guy told us ki dekho, NIT Allahabad is good, but ladkiyon ke liye theek nahi hai, waha pe pathar chalte hain, waha pe bachche exam hall mein chhuri leke aa jaate hain. So that was enough for my parents, okay, good career but thanks, no thanks. So they put me in the next best at the time which was NIT Kurukshetra. So then I went for the first time, left my home and lot of rona dhona in the train I remember to Kurukshetra and then my dad took me there, dropped me off, got me a hostel room and everything and then four years of engineering happened there, where it was, it was nice, it was very nice, at that time at least because academically I was good, I was sorted because I had had all this rigorous background of studying and I was good at cracking exams. So aa jaate the acche number, I used to be again topper popper in all semesters. But more than that, what I really liked about that experience was the kind of grooming that it was for my personality, I joined a lot of, I was the chief editor of the college magazine, technical society mein, executive member, matlab aisa extracurricular bahut kuch. I used to play sports, I used to be cultural events, kuch na kuch. So I was always busy, I was always up to something and it was again at that time very uncharacteristic for a girl to be this active in these things because it was, you know, quizzing is boys ka area, literature and debate club is boys ka area, magazine likhna is boys ka area. And so I was this outsider who was, they would select girls in these clubs, but mostly it was seen as eye candy, ki chalo thodi ladkiya bhi leke aatein club mein. And then by the time of, by the senior years, most girls would peter out in participation because there was no, really no support from the organization, from the institution or from the culture within the students also. It was not very friendly for girls. So I remember there was, we used to have a girls' hostel and usmein girls' timing was like 4.30 ko lectures khatam hua hai, 5.30 tak aapko andar hona hai. So basically you had one hour to go eat a samosa in the canteen and enjoy campus life as it were. And for boys, obviously, puri raat campus mein yahaan pe daru leke peeke padha hua hain and they're like living it up there. Not that daru is the measure of living it up, but the access to that public space, after hours to go sit outside college library and, you know, have all those memories, build those memories which people look back on. We got no such chances because we were sheep, cattle herded into the hostel at sundown. So summers ke time thodo zyada time milta tha, winters mein toh bas class khatam hui, ek ghante ke andar sunset ho jayega, aap chalo bhaago. That I felt it was very, very restrictive and in hindsight it was quite misogynistic because the wardens and their attitude was ki yeh jagah safe nahi hai ladkiyon ke liye. Haryana hai, yahaan pe ladkiyan chhed dete hain, yahaan pe ladkiyon ko utha ke le jate hain, hum aapko nahi jaane de sakte bhaar. Aapki betiyaan humari zimmedaari hain and they would tell our parents ki aap socho, main inki parent ki tarah soch rahi hu, agar meri beti hoti toh main yeh karti. And I was like, well, we are living on campus. This is your area. If you are not able to protect a student in this area, that's on you. That's not on the student. You cannot penalize the student because she happens to be a girl. But anyway, at that time, we didn't have such voice and khudi apne andar itni internalized misogyny thi ki hum accept bhi khale the ki haan bhai yeh hi sahi, yeh aise hi life hai. So I remember for college magazine printing waqara karane ke liye, I used to go aadi raat ko printer ki shop pe and tell yahaan pe ki, Karnal mein meri maasi hai, wo bimaar hai, mujh unke dekhne jaana hai, aise karke I used to write these applications, get it signed by a friend as my aunt or local guardian or something, and then give it to the warden. And the warden also often would see through it. She'd be like, haan mujhe pata hai yeh kaunsi maasi hai, Karnal mujhe baar baar bimaar hoti"

        "message": "It was just the nearest town. So anyway, I mean, she, I think she thought I was going out with a boy or something, which was where their mind always went. So there was a lot of slut shaming, unneedlessly, ki aap, matlab literally, I was a student going out to participate in an extracurricular college campus activity, which was benefiting me, benefiting the campus. It is a part of the kind of all round development that you should be offering your students, you should be encouraging in your students, but instead you are penalizing them, you're slut shaming them, you're telling them ki aadi raat ko ladkiya andher mein jaake kya karti hain ladko ke saath humein pata hai. This is literally a line that the chief warden has told me. These were the, that was the kind of atmosphere where you had to really, this is also the reason why most girls would peter out of clubs and societies and all, right? For me, it was just a passion and I was, I found a lot of meaning and joy in that. So I used to, I used to find my ways around it. So that, all that happened, four years of college went out that way. In hindsight, again, much more misogyny that I see there now than I saw at that time, which was probably good for my mental health that I didn't see it that time, otherwise, krantikari ban jate hoon, chaar saal tak mein moorchai nikalti rehti. The atmosphere in Gurukshetra was also very, I mean, it had all sorts of other issues also. There's a lot of toxic masculinity also, literally, there were boys in our college who would go out in the evening on bikes and, malab ladki jaariya peeche se uske baal kheechke chale gaye, pen chhen liya, knock off her books or something, you know, just like, it was harmless words like, if teasing are used for it, it is sexual harassment. And that was very common on campus, more from the boys who would come from outside than the boys from within campus, but everyone had access and everyone, Gurukshetra University is like a thousand acre campus in which 300 acres is NIT Gurukshetra, within the campus. So Gurukshetra University, KAU bolte the, KAU ke ladke andar aate the, KAU ke ladko ko hamare naam, details, phone number pata hote the, like, men we've never met, don't know that they exist, they know everything about our lives. So that was the extent of scrutiny that girls would be under in that surrounding. And there was, like I said, a lot of toxic masculinity in our third year, I think I was in third year, when there was an incident of violence between boys. So there were gangs of boys there and one gang beat up the other gang or they, somebody brought a hockey stick and somebody brought a fawda, spade. And so this was, became famous as the fawda incident on campus, ke ek ladke ne doose ladke ka sar khol diya fawda maarke. And basically that boy, I think he later survived, but he had some lifelong paralysis or some issue, obviously, like literally his head was cracked open by another student. So that was the extent of stuff that the boys on campus were dealing. So credit to them also where it belongs. And I remember there was a long break, suddenly humari chhutiyan kar di gayi, we were sent home and some boys went underground and they had parents who were Haryana ka IPS officer, uska father hai and then somehow he was bailed out, the guy who did this and all of that weird parallel universe also existed while I was working on my magazines and clubs and little cute little things. That was a context and general scene in which Kurukshetra happened. Towards the end, in my final year, I got placed into campus placement, say I got two jobs, but then I also wrote CAT in that year. And again, it was very unlikely that I would have cleared it because no, no coaching class again in Kurukshetra. So I did this distance wala mock test thing, time ka usam hota tha and lot of my batchmates used to had just given up on studies and extracurriculars in the final year ke rose train leke weekend pe Delhi jaake career launcher ki class mein padha hi karke aayenge and I was here till the last day running around organizing fests and everything in college as the final year student who was still not given that legitimacy because I was a girl, we'll come back to that later. But there was in the final year, yeah, I used to go, I used to do this distance thing for mock tests, and then I was the surprise candidate who cleared CAT. And then toh fir isliye I didn't join any job and I went on to IIM Bangalore after that right after campus. IIM Bangalore was a whole other universe because like I said, Kurukshetra mein academically I was very, very comfortable. By the end of it, I had a 9.9 CGP out of 10, which was log sunte hain toh aankhe fad jati hain. But for me, I feel like I was actually not that hard because like I said, I had become quite good at cracking the Indian education system. Toh mujhe pada tha exam mein kaisa poochenge, how to do smart prep the night before the exam and then the night after the exam, I would press a reset button, so today I cannot tell you what a microprocessor is with a gun to my head. So that was, I am an electronics engineer by the way, so that's quite shameful to admit. I went into IIM Bangalore after that. Wahape, it was a whole other, academic comfort se coming there was a very different experience because wahape saare ek topper the, wahape toh yeh tha ki bhai pattar peko topper ko lagega. So it was, everybody there was exceptional people academically at least, but probably not as diverse. So we were a batch of 249 people out of which 227 were engineers. So we all, we, different degrees of genius, but all thinking the same way, sabka dimaag train ki tarah ek hi line pe chalta hai. So I think there were like less than 20 or so people from arts and yeh sab background who were just brought in for diversity, usse mein yeh hota tha ki is cheez ke marks zyada milte hain, ki agar aapne CAT kar liya aur aapka arts background hai, toh wo aapko zyada marks denge interviewer kyunki they want that diversity on campus, but obviously we were not doing a good enough job of diversity because we are still very, very engineering dominated. So I would actually love interacting with those students who came from different backgrounds because they brought a very different way of thinking to things. And I was a fresher, which, what is called a fresher, which is that no work experience, directly engineering ke baad MBA. So I also got a lot of different life perspectives from my batchmates who had work experience because they would have this attitude of yeh sab se kuch fark nahi padta hai, humne dekha hai real life mein, whereas the freshers like us were like, areh marks, areh exam, areh yeh. So I kind of evolved beyond that because I surrounded myself with friends who didn't care as much about academics and about all of that. So we did decently well, passably okay in IIM, I was no, no gold medalist there. I went on in student exchange while there in my, they were, doh saal mein there are three trimesters, so, sorry, six trimesters. So fifth trimester is a student exchange program, which I did in Germany, in a college, B school in Germany. So for me, that was the highlight of my MBA, ke I got to travel abroad and live in another country in a rented apartment with other students and hum log, we were like the only 16 Indians in a hundred kilometer radius around there. So hum log milke chole chawal bana rahe hain, raat ko to get a taste of our food and learnt how to cook, learnt how to manage a household to the extent a student does. And I was, I did a lot of traveling, I traveled like to like some 11 countries. So again, academics was the last thing on our mind, ke ye to hoyi jaayega. And I remember humara jab exam hua tha waha pe, toh Indian students were leaving so fast because like we have been conditioned to game the education system so well that the poor Germans, agar teen mahina pehle project diya hai, toh wo log teen mahine ka ek wo banayenge, poora timeline chart, ke pehle hafte hum ye karenge, doosra hafta we will visualize, teesra hafta we will find data, chautha hafta we will do primary research for this. And Indians are like, ye deadline kab hai, ek raat pehle baithenge, night out maarenge, ho jaayega. Sounds just like me, I gotta tell you. I know, you did that right, like last night baithke moomaning padha hai poora."

Anyway, so we were, the joke was that on that day when we were all writing the exam, the Indian students were leaving so fast that the examiner stopped one of us and was like, show me your wallet, and you have definitely cheated, how are you leaving so fast? And he was like, I haven't, like literally, I know the answers, jutta mujhe pata hai surface hai, main lik diya hai, aur mujhe pata hai main pass ho jaunga, itte main. And pretty much that was the attitude of all of us there, satisficing to the worst level, in the worst way possible. So yeah, the education and all was secondary there, but the cross-cultural experience was very, very, was very interesting, and I think that contributed much more to our growth."

        "message": "Let's double click on a few things and then we'll rejoin this journey. So a whole bunch of things to double click on, I want to go back to when you were talking at the start about how you learned about, you know, the experiences of your grandparents during partition and all of that, and how they came over and what they went through. And I've also sort of been thinking for a long time, and it's a thought that came up again when I read your post, is that women always have this sort of extra layer of obstacles to overcome to get to whatever they're doing. I remember I'd done this episode I really enjoyed with Kavita Rao, who'd written about the lady doctors of the 19th century. And some of the stories that are stunning, like the one that moved me a lot, and I keep going back to is that of Hemabati Sen, who was born in this village somewhere in what was then Bangladesh in the 1840s or 1850s, right? She was married off to a middle-aged widower at the age of nine. During the day, she would play with his children. During the night, she would forget what happened, but basically she would wake up naked and bleeding, right? This went on for a couple of years until her husband died, his parents died, her parents died. So she's 11 years old, and her family basically kicks her out on the street and she's got no money. So parents are dead, both sets of parents, husband is dead, you'd imagine life is over. She's 11 years old, no money, village in Bangladesh, right, 1850s. She makes her way from there to be one of India's first lady doctors. And she achieves positions of eminence in terms of the first woman head of a guild or whatever I forgot in the details. She writes a diary about her life. And after she dies, that diary is lost in a trunk, which isn't open for 85 years. And then in the 1990s or the early 2000s, somebody opens it and it's published as a memoirs of Hemabati Sen, you can, you know, read it online. And not just this story, because one story can be an outlier. But reading about the lady doctors of the 1900s, what struck me was that to be a lady doctor at all, forget how good a doctor forget what you achieve, just to be a lady doctor, you had to be ridiculously outstanding, you had to have immense character, immense strength, you had to have overcome a lot. While to be a male doctor, you simply had to be born into privilege, basically, right time, right place, good things happen, you kind of get there, you could be mediocre. Similarly, in your stories, you know, what you've written in your newsletter is that time and again, you know, I was reading stories of ordinary women, who on the face of it seem ordinary, that their lives are ordinary, nothing special about them, you know, normal job karte hai, ek do bachche hai, ghar chalate hai, whatever. But then you go into one, you go into the interior lives to a fair extent. And two, you make us realize that their existence isn't so ordinary, that they have so many more odds to beat than a comparable male. So just going, you know, circling back to your grandparents, for example, and thinking aloud over there, how did they cope? And is it that the women coped differently, or coped better? Or, you know, they could kind of, they carried that burden in a different way? Were there different kinds of denial that might have set in for the men or the women? Because one common way that I can just think for men to deal with it is a certain kind of macho denial, you know, and some of that could also, you know, involve just running away from what just happened, or, you know, not facing up to that. So I'm just sort of, I see this, you know, I'm applying this thread that I've seen go through. And, you know, so my question, therefore, is that, now looking back in hindsight, do you feel that the women coped with it differently? Do you feel that some of that toughness also rubbed off on you? Because even a little thing like, you know, inventing a maasi in Karnal, to kind of get out, is also a way of fighting back, of saying ki nahi, mai nahi loongi, mujhe jaana hai, mujhe karna hai, right? Did some of it rub off from there as well? So what are your sort of observations on that broad subject? And how much of it, you know, could you see in this particular instance of your grandparents and your parents and what they kind of, you know, go through to just to just live their lives, like even your mother getting transferred like that, obviously, that boss in Delhi would have been some toxic asshole. So you know, so what are your observations now, looking back?"

One, I obviously come from strong women, which is now clear to me in hindsight, which was not a recurring, you know, undercurrent of my life that every day I'm waking up and thinking, wow, what strong women around me, but I mean, strong women was not even a thing that was even recognized or let alone celebrated in the time that we grew up in. And I mean, let alone the time before that, humare dada, dadi, nana, nani ke time pe toh, it wasn't even a thing. It was just a given that, yes, my dadaji will travel across the country, going to all these theatres and I imagine having a good circle of friends and to meet in every city and hang out with. Meanwhile, my dadi is at home raising these four boys by herself and my dad tells me stories of how, you know, she would have to take, literally, woh jo movie mein nahi dikhate hain, ke woh sahookar ke paas aurat jaati hai, ke anaaj de do thoda sa aur woh bolta hai, ke tumhara account settle karo pehle. And then that filmy scenes that they show in purane zawaani ki movies, that's what their life was like. Like she would, by the time my dadaji would come back from tour and he's not in a salary job that every month money is coming into the account, so by the time he would come back from tour, that's when he would bring the money, but by that time, the stocks in the house were at zero, ke ghar mein ghee khatam hai, tel khatam hai, chawal khatam hai, dhaan khatam hai, sab kuch. So, and we're basically, they are living in debt of all the local sahookars and all. And so, my grandmother was dealing with all of that. Then my grandfather would come and settle all the debts and then suddenly they would live a very happy life for, until the next tour began. Obviously, a very strong woman who was practically single parenting her children while the husband is away. Again, like I said about, talked about my nani giving birth to child after child, losing, despite losing children, an immense amount of pain, trauma, grief, I can't even imagine what all she went through. My par nani who lost her husband so young and then goes on to become a school principal and raise her children by herself, doesn't remarry and is a strong independent woman in that sense. My par dadi also was widowed early and she also was like, she raised my dada and his sister herself for the most part. These are all, obviously, I come from a stock of strength, of strong women. My mother's life, when I think about it, I think I was a very thankless child when I was growing up, as most children are, which is, I guess, understandable, forgivable up to a certain age. But I was very thankless in hindsight and I didn't appreciate the life she led, you know. She would literally get up at 5am, bachchon ka khana, husband ka khana, dabba office ka, apna dabba office ka, phir then my dad is waking up later and having his morning tea and then bachchon ko subah, mallab I would sleep while brushing my teeth, then I would sleep in the loo, then I would sleep in the bathroom. So, she had to come and wake me up 20 times in the morning, within the span of one hour. Again, in hindsight, now I know what a thankless and useless liability of a child I was. But at the time, it feels like natural, ke haan yeh, toh mummi ka kaam hai, mummi kar rahi hain. But now, when you think about it, she's also a working woman. She's also doing her job, going to office, dealing with colleagues and everything. Then shaam ko ghar aa rahi hain, again raat ko dinner wahegar bana rahe mein lagi hain and raat ko 12 baje tak, she's on her feet in the kitchen, helping. We had a bit of domestic help, but it wasn't, I mean, there were still these notions of which, in my parents' house, it's still true, ke mummi ke haath ka khaana hi banega. Toh haan, theek hai, they'll be help, but ultimately, khaana toh mummi ke haath ka banega, roti hain toh garam-garam hone chahiye, jo utarti-utarti roti, those concepts are still there. So, she was living in that reality and, I mean, I don't think she was even feeling oppressed or anything. Again, in that age, these were all accepted as facts of life. This is how life is. And so, her generation, particularly, I felt was very sandwiched because up until then, women were mostly housewives. I mean, not to take credit away from stay-at-home mothers who have an incredibly challenging life of their own, but this was one generation where women said, no, I also want to work. And society said, okay, go and work, but not at the cost of everything else you were already doing. So, in my generation, I am, my work or my womaning or whatever I choose to do with my life is the primary thing. And then, my house is still, a lot of it is still on me, but I am not physically standing in the kitchen cooking rotis every day. So, in our generation, we have been offloaded some of that burden, at least the physical part. I mean, the workload is still large, but the physical part of that labor is of our generation, at least in our social economic band. So, humare liye, that burden has been reduced. And one generation above, their burden of going to office was not there. But this generation in the middle, my mom's generation and my mother-in-law's generation and all of our moms, they had to do this double whammy, bahar jao kaam karne, but you have to earn that right back by also not letting anything slip at home. So, you are doing the job of the last generation also and the next generation also and together as one person, which is, to me, inhuman. Like, when I think about it now, I feel like my mom's life, I can never live that life. It was so hard. And we were thankless at that time about it, but now when I think about it, yes, I do come from strong women and it's a pity that we did not celebrate this sooner and did not recognize them and not just celebrate them, but, you know, make their life a little easier than it was. It was much harder than it needed to be."

In his old age, I remember whenever he'd visit me in Bombay, I'd take him to the Marriott for breakfast because he loved the buffet spread there and he would eat everything. He would try every single thing, right? If anybody is offering anything for free, he wants it. And I found it amusing. And obviously, at the same time, the rational explanation for it is that our parents grew up in times of relative scarcity, you know, kuch bhi aasan nahi tha, you know, there wasn't an abundance of anything. So you valued whatever you've got and you had this culture of never wasting anything, you know, that old cliche of people are starving in China, so finish what you got, right?"

So it came from that sort of scarcity mindset, whereas we can take all of that stuff for granted. And if I'm not finishing my food, I can, you know, I can get all rational and say, arre sunk cost fallacy and this and that, we can get into that stuff, right? And you point out, and this is something that many guests of mine have spoken about with regard to their parents and their grandparents, that hunger for education, ki education karna hai. And their parents were so educated, you know, they kind of instilled that in you as well, that it meant a big deal, ki class mein topper banna hai, 90 nahi chalega, 95 chahiye, mera aadha maa kahan gaya, right? And you start caring about this stuff. And I'm again, tying it in with another observation I made recently, where I was at a conference organized by some investors who are investing in very unconventional ways and people around the country, and they brought together a whole bunch of entrepreneurs, including people who were like 17 and 18. And my observation there was that number one, these young people are mind blowing, they're a different level. But number two, and this is something I strongly believe is that real change in India in any field, you know, will come from the small towns, it will come from hungry young people in small towns, because they want it more, they have a better work ethic, and they have bigger dreams, they're not constrained as much by conventional thinking. And I'm just tying all of this together, and wondering if it is, therefore, that background at last really plays a big part that if you grow up with a certain kind of scarcity, you don't take it for granted. We don't have a scarcity of information out there, there's an abundance of it. But we take it for granted by spending all our time on Twitter, and, you know, doing other matar ghashti or whatever it is, right? We are not taking advantage of that. If you gave the internet to our parents, I think matlab chaar din mein toh daddy poora internet pad lete, you know, because that hunger was there, which came from scarcity. So what are your sort of thoughts on this, in the sense that you came from a background where you didn't take this stuff for granted, right? You had to work for it. You know, even when you had one bad year in school, you just, you know, got down to it, topped the West Zone or whatever you topped the next year, you kind of got it done. So in your observation through your own life, and perhaps even through doing this newsletter, you've met so many people of varied backgrounds and all of that, how much would you say this matters that, you know, your background matters, your class matters, all of this really shapes who you are and what you are like, if you were born in a really rich family, and you were chilling and doing holidays in Switzerland, I suspect you would have been a very different person. Yeah, so so what are sort of your thoughts on this? Because you meet and talk to many, many more people than I do, you know, from much more diverse backgrounds."

But my thoughts on generally background is that, yeah, we are all a product of our background, our experiences, to a very large extent, yes, there is free will and choice in there. But there's also a lot of, like I said, when I was talking about our IM batch, 249-27 engineers, you could see that there is a way of thinking that all of these children have, all of these students have as compared to the others. So even, and you could say we were all from different towns and different backgrounds and economically, socially, everywhere. But still, there was a way that we were all conditioned in thinking by virtue of just those four years of our education. So obviously, when you talk about the, your entire life and all the generations that came before you, it is a, it has an undeniable effect on who you turn out to be as a person. You know, I mean, one of the things that, one of the reasons I was thinking that this might be the most intellectually low IQ episode of Seen and the Unseen is because I am a Bollywood fan, right? So I am coming with that level of intellectual analysis. So for, I'm sure you've had guests who would be able to quote research papers on this from international research, white papers and intelligent things like that. But my, mujhe, mere dimaag mein literally when you were talking was coming coffee with Karan. Because I was thinking of all of these, you know, star kids and the entire nepotism debate and the star kids that come on that show and Karan Johar himself. You see a very, I mean, I love the show, I watch it as soon as an episode drops, but it's entertaining to me because also sometimes you see how out of touch with reality people can get when they are born into privilege. And you know, there's also sometimes a lack of, extreme lack of self-awareness. Like if you read Karan Johar's book, which again can be the lowest IQ show note ever on Seen and the Unseen, but if you read his book, you'll see like there's so much contradiction of himself within one paragraph, there is like self-awareness bohot kam. So when you're born in that level of privilege and cushion, it obviously doesn't push you to question yourself or your place in society or where you're headed beyond a point. Now as a parent, actually, that's a real concern that my husband and I have about our child because we feel like this child is born in full privilege, right? Like we had what you could still call a middle class upbringing. Now we are not middle class. Now we are maybe top 1% or even 0.1% of society with IIM education and civil services and all that privilege background. This child, our child is born into privilege. How do we give him a taste of reality and, you know, obviously you want comforts for your child, but at the same time, you don't want him to be so cushioned that he grows up in living in a fairy land that has no connection to reality. We want him to grow up to be a contributive citizen of society."

And there's a slum right behind that colony, but it's hidden from view. And the residents of the colony, we like to pretend that it doesn't exist. There's a WhatsApp group of the colony RWA. And often the topics being discussed there are ki, my cleaning lady is asking for 500 rupees more, how dare they, this is extortion. And there's so much rage against someone who's coming from a much more underprivileged background than you. And for her, 500 rupees means the world, for you, it's not even a coffee. So I mean, it's very disturbing to see that level of disconnection with reality and empathy. So for me, it's very important that my child has that empathy and is, you know, aware of what privilege is and is very, very conscious of his own. I mean, already he's just three and I already have explained the word lucky to him, that you know, you're lucky because, see, I showed him the other day, a lady on a wheelchair. And I told him that, see that lady, she's on a chair with wheels. So he said, why? I said, because she can't walk. See how lucky we are, because we can. So you know, small things like that. But I feel even at this early age, I'm talking to him about how lucky he is, because he needs to be very conscious, especially as a male child that too, and born to such privilege, that he needs to be conscious at every step. One thing I really detest is when people give all of the credit for their achievements to themselves. I am here because of my own hard work. I mean, for a privileged person to say that, it's very tone deaf and black self-awareness. Because like, for example, even talking about myself, I am here not today on this great show of yours, not because of my hard work only, but also because of all of these generations that came before me, and my parents valued my education, and the kind of upbringing I had, the kind of experiences I was privileged to have, right. So if you lose that perspective of the debt that you owe to so many people, many of them you've never even seen, many of them didn't even live in the same time as you did. But you, this is all the history behind where you are today. And that's important for him to realize, that's one thing. And the other is also more exposure to the real world, like last week was his birthday, and we celebrated in a shelter for rescue animals. So he loved feeding the goat, and feeding the donkey, and feeding the duck, and obviously little kids love animals, and there's a beautiful shelter called Bhan Yad in Delhi, near Saket. But I chose to take him there instead of throwing him a lavish poolside party like many of his peers are already getting, because I thought this keeps him more grounded and in touch with reality. He'll be as happy, he's a baby at least right now, he doesn't have any notions of what a birthday party should look like. But these are experiences that I want him to have, and obviously he's still a toddler, so you still protect him from many of the harsher realities of life, but as he grows up, more and more of these realities need to be introduced to him in a way that makes him a more empathetic person. So that's my take on parenting. I also want to circle back to what you said about imposter syndrome. So I want to tell you, just to increase the IQ of the show notes that I leave behind, there is a test by Professor Pauline Chance, who was the person who coined the term imposter syndrome. Obviously a woman did it. And obviously she did it because she saw other women. That's how she even arrived at the realization that, is there a problem with the way we are all seeing ourselves? So she asked that question thankfully, and she came up with a test to diagnose imposter syndrome. And we can link to that test, and I would urge all your listeners, especially women, to take that test. It's a test on which you score from 0 to 100, and the higher your score, the higher is your imposter syndrome. And you'll have questions like, do you often think that you don't deserve to be where you are? Like, I am literally right now very, in all honesty, been thinking since you invited me that I don't deserve to be on the show. Why is he inviting me? What will I do here? What will I say that will add any value? This is, I know that maybe at some intellectual level, I know that it's not true, but I'm programmed to think that it is the way that it is. And I was, while writing this piece on imposter syndrome that you talked about, one of the women who I had interviewed for the piece, I told her, hey, do me a favor, just take this test because I took the test and I knew my score. And I said, tell me what is your score? Because I'm covering your story. I want to know how much of imposter syndrome do you actually have? And she said, yeah, I have like, the test says I have like a significant amount of imposter syndrome. My score is 35 out of 100. And my score was 88. So you had much more of it. My score is 88 out of 100 on imposter syndrome. So that's how, that's how badly I have held myself back. So I'm sorry for all of the self-deprecatory things I've said so far. And I'm going to continue saying, but it's, it's conditioning. It's a lot of unlearning that I consciously keep trying to do, but it still comes out at times like these."

        "message": "I had a guest at home, and I forget who it is, maybe Shruti Jagirdar, because she's the last person I recorded with at home, or maybe before that, but it was a woman. And that woman before the episodes pointed out something to me, which was very true. She said that a lot of your great episodes are with women. And they always start by saying, pata nahi mujhe kyu bulaya hai. You know, so the imposter syndrome is really like a woman problem. And I'm going to now double click on the imposter syndrome. But before doing that, I'm very impressed by the awareness which you bring to your parenting. And I almost feel like I have a stake in this because I know both you and your husband very well. You've been a good friend for much longer. But one of the great books of social science of the last century was this book called The Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris. And it was very controversial, because it showed with great data and all of that, that the impression that people have that kids are shaped by their parents a lot is actually not true, that the influence that parents have on what their kid turns out to be is minuscule and the far greater influences is of their peers, you know, so when you said that for, you know, your son's friends are already having pool parties thrown for them and all of that, you know, that kind of came to mind, but I hope in your case, you guys are influential enough to protect him from that. And there's a contradictory thought here. And they're both true in their different domains. And one is a role of luck. Like one of the things my time as a professional poker player taught me is that we underestimate the role of luck in our lives, like poker is, of course, a game of skill, but the quantum of luck is very high. So you need a huge sample size of events for your skill to express itself. And similarly, in life, and I've written about this quite often, we underestimate the role of luck to the extent that exactly what you said happens that good things happen to people, they give credit for it to themselves, and they allow themselves to get arrogant, and bad things happen to people. And they allow it to affect their self esteem, and they get themselves down and they suffer from imposter syndrome, and so on and so forth. And we should sort of watch out for that and sort of try to be equanimous. I think this understanding of luck and probability almost takes you into a Buddhist direction where you're kind of, you know, you leave your emotions out of it and you're equanimous, which is, I guess, a sort of a good way to be and, and I would imagine that these different directions you go in when you ignore luck, there's a role of gender to it also, it's a men who are more likely to look at the good that happens to them and get arrogant and so women who are more likely to have that confidence gap, you know, there was this great article in the Atlantic called the confidence gap, which also are linked to which, you know, reference to a number of these studies showing that, you know, women will not apply for jobs that they absolutely deserve, you know, you in your piece on imposter syndrome, you quoted this lady called Archana. So I'll just quote that bit. And these are her words, because I think they're very sort of, they're applied to a lot of people where, you know, a global role was advertised in her company. And she said, quote, even though the whole world was telling me to apply for it, I wasn't sure I was ready. It was my classic, I'm getting it because I'm a woman logic. I didn't want people to question why was I given this role. So I ended up not applying for it at all. When the position was finally filled, I was shocked to discover that a man who had far less relevant experience in me had been selected for it. The HR leader later told me in confidence that out of the pool of candidates ever considering for the position, I was the only one who everybody unanimously thought could do the job. And you've got sort of other examples of this as well, including people like Maya Angelou once saying, quote, I have written 11 books, but each time I think, oh, they're going to find out now. I've run a game on everybody and they're going to find me out, stop quote, and Einstein says a similar thing. And this is also known in psychology as a Dunning-Kruger effect, right? That I mean, there are two sides to the Dunning-Kruger effect. One side is, you know, people tend to think they are better at something than they actually are. Like, for example, Lake Wobegon is a famous example of that. Lake Wobegon is a fictional town created by the novelist Garrison Keillor, where everybody thinks they're better than average, which can obviously not be the case, right?"

When people tell me that you've been showering me with these kind compliments about the work I've done. Like my earlier pre-writing womaning, my instinct was to deny and argue back and no, no, Amit, this is not true. Anyone can write it and see so many people write newsletters and sub-stack numbers, dekho kitte writers hai ye wo. I would have argued back. Now I hold that argument, it's still in my mind, but I force myself to say thank you. That's for me big. I know it sounds very normal and what's the big deal in it, but I suppose women and even men who suffer from severe crippling imposter syndrome will realize that that's a big step to just graciously accept a compliment. That's one change that I have forced myself, I've consciously made and succeeded in making happen. And the second was about how after you said, are you able to go for things? That has happened a lot more after motherhood because I feel like motherhood kind of is a transformative experience, that's an understatement for sure. But also for me at least, it gave me the perspective of how little things matter that we think so much about. And when you become responsible for another human life is when you feel that everything else I worry about was so inconsequential. After becoming a mother, when people would talk to me about mera boss, mera deadline, mera office, I'd be like, yeh kya begar cheezon pe log tension le rahe hain. My own things that would hold me back, which would seem like big things in the past, now I've become a lot more pragmatic about it and you know, universe is very large, life is very long, we are a speck in the universe, it doesn't really matter whether I come on a podcast or what be in the larger scheme of things. So let me accept if a friend is inviting me and I know I might feel this primal urge that I don't deserve to be here, but forget it, it's okay. Plenty of undeserving people get what they don't deserve. Maybe I do deserve it, maybe I don't, either way it doesn't matter in the larger scheme of things. So that kind of attitude of doesn't really matter in the larger scheme of things and what really matters is I am responsible for a life, for an individual and that is going to be probably my biggest contribution. That kind of also gives you a lot more grounding and you tend to be more, for me at least it has made me more adventurous in the decisions I take."

        "message": "Yeah, so that has been a learning over decades for me, because, like I said, I was a full on misogynist when I was young, as I'm in love school, I was like a proper tomboy, I've written about this also. So that that was my ethos also, and it was like a very common undercurrent of the average young psyche in that in the 90s, that, you know, girls are stupid, they talk about fashion and they are always gossiping and I'm above all that. And so I was I genuinely had more male friends in school, because I used to look down upon women and friendships with women, and I used to think that women are a lot, there's a lot of politics, there's backstabbing, there's all this stuff happening, which is too much to take. Men are simpler, and boys have nothing going on in their brains beyond what they are doing at that moment, easier to deal with them. And I used to genuinely feel that male friendships are better and stronger, because I would see them lasting over years, right, like our fathers would still be friends with their childhood male friends, but our mothers, you would never hear of ke meri school mein wo friend thi, meri college mein wo friend thi. Now later in life, I realized that that was also a privilege that men had, right, to stay in touch with their peers and their friends. And women were often married off into separate families, surname change, often name also change in the absence of a social network, how will they even stay in touch? And they are so busy with everyday life, like I've told you my mom's daily routine, where is the space in that for friendships? So all of those were things that I didn't see at that time, and I had these notions about male friendships versus female friendships. But over the years, I have realized that it's actually the other way around. Female friendships, when with the right people who are, you know, who have that realization of how the world is designed to hold us back, and we are on our own, we have to build each other up. And when you have that kind of a positive female friendship, it can be the best thing that you do in your life, just talking to that friend. And like I told you, I used to beat up other women, ke tum kyu apne baar mein itna chota soch ro? And I would not say that to myself ever, because I am thinking, myself thinking less of myself. So then my friend will come and beat me on that, ke yaar tum kyu apne baar mein aisa soch ro? So I mean, the standard trope is talk to yourself the way you would talk to your best friend. But we are not able to do that because we are, as you quoted from the post, we are conditioned not to do that. So that's why I think in that context, female friendships, especially with women who have that perspective of building each other up, that sort of a female friendship can just be a huge, huge boost and support in your life. And you also have these shared experiences. So that was the whole reason I started writing Womaning when I realized that many things I was experiencing were not unique to me. Because up until then, I thought ye mere saath hi ho raha hai, jo ho raha hai. And because I have this great, unique trajectory in life that all of the things that I've done, which half of them we covered and my career to bhi start bhi nahi hua hai, all of that, which I've done, that is the reason why I am having these experiences at work, with the family and everything. But then when you start talking to other women, you realize that a lot of these are shared experiences and a lot of them are not because I am who I am, but because I'm a woman. And when you see that undercurrent and that thread, that's the whole reason I started writing Womaning. Because I was like, this thread needs to be made more obvious to men and women both. Because women need to realize that my challenges are not unique to me. And they are not something that's happening to me because of something I did. I don't deserve this. This is a gender wide thing. And men need to realize, be more conscious of them for obvious reasons too."

        "message": "This is a black box for me to I've thought about this a lot often, when was that time? Is there any one moment in which I suddenly had a coin dropping moment, oh, this is how the world is. And now I see everything from that lens, like, people close to me accuse me, you're like, you know, with a person with a hammer to whom everything is a nail now, that's how you are with gender. And that's I am guilty of that to some extent, but it is so overarching and every and just omnipresent this this lens, but I don't know a particular moment, I, I think the explanation I have come to is that it was I was just a part of a larger cultural shift that happened at some point in the 2000s and early 2010s, which is that we started recognizing some of these things that we had taken, accepted at face value, to be not the way the world necessarily should be. And there's something wrong here. So I think Mrinalji spoke about this on during her, her interview with you. And she said that, aisa lagta tha ke kuch galat ho raha hai, par pata nahi tha kya hai. So I had that feeling my entire childhood, ke even though, like I said, I was a misogynist myself, and I was guilty of all of these tropes, believing them, following them, propagating them. But I also had this nagging feeling, especially because I grew up with a brother, right. So I would see very stark differences in the way everybody and the world treated him, not just my family, but the institutions around us, the society, public spaces, friends, everything. And this difference became much more stark as we grew older, because as kids, you're still, I mean, at least, credit to my parents, they never did any discrimination, ke ladki hai toh isko do roti kam di jayenge, that didn't happen in my house at all. It was the other way around, badla, I think I was quite pampered by my dad. But there was a difference, ke haan, tum iti zor se mat haso, aise ladkiya nahi hasti hain. Aur you know, I remember one memory of hum gayi, bus mein kahin ja rahe the and I stood up and immediately I was told ke baith jao, peeche wale sab dekhenge, ladkiya aise khadi nahi hoti hain. And it was, for me, it was such a weird thing, ke ladkiya ka kya hai isme khade hone, I just want to stretch, I'm standing, but then suddenly it is, there is a new lens that you're introduced to, that this is the way the world is going to see you, and so you better not cross the line there. So those faint lines started becoming more clear as I grew older. When we went to college, suddenly, like I said, I always had more male friends than female friends all through school. But suddenly there was a different lens with which my male friendships were seen when I, once I entered college, because there were a lot of romantic relationships happening in batch mates and all. So my mom always used to call me, koi hai kya, kaun hai, kya hai. And if I mention a boy's name in passing, then suddenly she wants to double click on that, as you say, let's double click, ladke ka naam. So I mean, those things never happened with my brother. So going out with friends, something simple for him, very, a thing that he didn't have to think about twice, I had to. I had to think about the way I would formulate that application to my parents, is tarah se bolenge saath mein yeh jaa rahi hai, woh jaa rahi hai, toh itne baje wapas aayenge, yeh mode of transport hai. So and even beyond that, like sometimes I wouldn't even bother because I would in my mind be like, yeh toh is not outside the realm of possibility for me. Ek Kurukshetra se Shimla ki trip ban rahi hai, friends ki, bhool jao. I'm sorry, I'm out even before I ask anybody else. I know this is not within my realm of possibilities. So there were things like this, which, especially between me and my brother, because that was one male figure that I had seen my whole life and us being treated the same our whole life. And then suddenly now us being treated differently. So I think that niggling thing behind my mind of kuch galat hai, started becoming more and more concrete with age, kuch zyada hi galat hai. And then over time, I think culturally also, like I said, our society, the F word feminism was introduced, movies mein thoda dikhne laga, ke haan, woh ladkiyan jo, peeche showpiece hoti thi aur ek woh bachao bachao bachao victim hogi hai, heroa kaise bacha lega, that's, aur ek gaane mein dance kar degi. So that's the extent of female representation we saw in pop culture, that began to be questioned and there were movies that shifted the narrative. So slowly, I think culturally also, the environment was conducive. And that's how it was a very, very gradual process. So I cannot think of any one trigger that led to it."

The only thought I have, which I've mentioned before, is the ethic of my parents have worked very hard to give me an education. And so I have one job in life, everything else is provided for me, I have one job, which is to study. So I'm going to do it well, because this is the least I can do to justify my parents efforts and sacrifices. So that kind of sailed me through school. And like you said, uske baad, doctor engineer do options hoti hain, bio mujhe pasand nahi aati si toh, ho gaya, physics, chemistry, maths, chalo, engineer. Uske baad bhi, it was, again, MBA was a very obvious and aspirational route for everyone. I did get a job, but I also got MBA. So nahi hota toh job kar lete, ho gaya toh kar liya. Again it was a very, going with the flow decision, which is just popular wisdom, parents' wisdom, sab log yeh kar rahe hain, achi cheez hai, karo. Even the choice of my branch, electronics and communication, I had no particular love for that direction, nor do I even today, but sadly. But that was just a very natural decision, ke best hoti hain, electronics aur computer science do best hain, unmein se ek le lo. Toh jo mil jayega, achche college mein le liya. It was not a very conscious decision on my part. I think the step where I started thoda sa taking conscious decisions was around the end of MBA, when the kind of job I went for. But until that point, it was following the flow, and that said, to this day, I tell people, because when you look back at my CV, it looks very, waah kya, bahot decisive steps have been taken at various junctures. But when people ask me for guidance, I'm like, dekho, for me, I don't, even today, I don't have a plan for this is what I want to do with my life. But for me, what has always worked is that the next step has been somehow clear to me. That either it has been, this is what I don't want to do.

Like womaning was something that was not a push from anywhere, it was a pull from inside me. It was literally something that was bursting to come out. So that was a decision made that way. But it was only the first step that was clear to me. Even that, until your course, as we'll discuss later, when you shifted it in my mind from a book to a newsletter, until that time, even that wasn't clear. So always it's been the first step, or rather the next step that has been clear to me. Beyond that, I can't see the road where it is going. But that much clarity and just the courage to take that step, which often, that itself is something denied to women and to a person who comes from a certain comfort, ab toh I am bagaira sab ho gaya, ab kaun chhod ke jate hain itni high paying job into government. So things like that, there are obstacles even in that taking one step. So those, those I have managed to overcome and those have been decisive steps."

But the philosophy being have a bias for action, you know, don't try to plan everything out in your head ki pehle yeh hoga, phir wo hoga, phir wo hoga. Just have a bias for action, just go out there, do something, you know, just just keep at it, just keep doing stuff. And I think that's what you've sort of done so well. So when you sent me a note about the kind of things you could talk about, I noticed these two were really interesting bullet points, which are life lessons from engineering in the Haryana hinterlands, and life lessons from IIM Bangalore. So we've kind of spoken about both of these places in general. But I'm intrigued by the term you use life lessons, like, how would you kind of sum it up in terms of what were your life lessons from these two places, and perhaps your lessons about yourself?"

        "message": "Yeah, so I think both of these places shaped me, I mean, rather than taking away a lesson outside of me, it was things that change inside me. So like I said, academically coming from a very strong background, I was very confident about those aspects. But I think my personality as a whole had not developed and to some extent, it is also because 9 to 12 tak cable TV bandh aur khelna bandh aur padh ke padhai karo, right. So that makes your personality a bit unidimensional, of course. So that I think I really came into my own and I blossomed in Kurukshetra, despite all the forces that impeded a woman from doing that on that campus. But I did, I kind of developed a lot more confidence in my abilities and organizational abilities, managerial abilities, the leadership abilities, things that I could pull together, juniors of college, inspire them and motivate them to achieve a goal, organize a festival or whatever it was, publish a magazine. So I think for me, Kurukshetra, the biggest thing I learned from engineering was not engineering, but it was this stuff. So for me, it was a personality development course, plus plus. That was my engineering. So that was the, not a lesson, but the way it changed me. And then I think in IIM, there was a lot of humility that came with it, because like I said, patthar feko, topar palal ko lagayega. So that is the environment you are in. And I remember in Ahmedabad, we used to actually live behind IIM Ahmedabad campus. And we were like young students aur aise afwaa hoti thi ki pata hai IIM ke bachche raat ko do ghanta sote hain, pata hai wo kitna padhai karte hain. And then suddenly, I am on that side and I am like, mereko toh needh aati hai, main kaise karoon. So, and then you genuinely see these people who are way above average, like they are another breed. The amount of discipline they have, the kind of academic drive in them. And then you realize that, oh, I have always thought of myself as an academically accomplished person, but I actually don't share this drive. So there were things that to be inspired from, there were also a lot of lessons of what not to do with life. So there's a lot of, and I'm sure my IIM peers who might be listening will agree with some parts of this. There's a lot of cutthroat competition, materialism, a lot of, life is a zero-sum game. That's a huge thing that's kind of drilled into you by the IIM culture, that there is a campus mein bolte the something called RG Giri. So there's a, RG is relative grading. So that's a system where you and I write one exam, you score higher than me, that effectively lowers my score. So it's not just that you got 10 on 10 and I got 9 on 10. It's also that my 9 becomes 8.5 because you got 10. It's like that. So, I mean, suppose you, so the higher you score as my peer, the worse it is for me."

I want to pull you down. If I see you succeeding, I want to put hurdles in your path. So it also kind of conditions you in a very toxic kind of mindset. I was luckily never able to learn any of those tricks, but I did see a lot of that. Like it was, it was sometimes tragic to the extent that people had imbibed these values and were able to live them like, um, I don't know if this will be worth airing, but there was a story that comes to mind, which is there was this group of topper guys, okay? There would be class projects and as they used to say, project group of five, there would be these guys who will make eye contact across the classroom and they would form a group in half a second. That we are toppers, we are going to stick together because our group will do the best and then therefore our Jigiri, the others will do worse off and we'll be the best. Fine to make groups with your friends, but there was a lens to it. It was not a lens of compatibility or friendship. It was a lens of success. Who is going to help me succeed the most? And then there were these students who would inevitably always be left behind at the end and who would not be accepted in any of the groups and it was often very heartbreaking. They would send emails later on the class group, ke koi group mein jaga hai, kya I am still looking and it was always the same kids, same students. I remember there was one classmate, batchmate, he was differently abled and he was always one of the last to be picked. And then I remember one course we had was business law and in which it was all about legal stuff and I used to doze off the second that professor would start talking, but usme yeh hi hua. Group bana, the professor said, groups of X and immediately this, I was sitting right behind one of the topper kids, jinka eye contact mein group ban jata tha. And that guy turns to his fellow topper guy and he says ki is group mein usko lete hain. The student who was always left behind because woh barrister tha pehle, toh isme hume uske hone se advantage hoga. And I just felt so evil at that time, I was like ki yaar, this is one guy you systemically always leave behind. Even I am guilty of it to some extent because I am making friends with my, groups with my friends and this guy is being left behind by all of us as a group every time, year after year, subject after subject, class after class. And this one time because he is useful to you, you immediately want to go get him first because you know that you all are IITians and you don't have that legal background. So for me it was very, these were lessons of what not to do with life also. I mean and I remember a few years later I met a batchmate who was a good friend on campus and many of my batchmates have gone on to do extremely well for themselves and a lot of well-deserved success, many are entrepreneurs of unicorn startups today and people have bungalows with indoor heated pools I am told, to which I am never invited. But people have done really well for themselves. I have consulted a therapist myself and one of the things my therapist has also told me is that because I live in Gurgaon, she said that lot of people who consult me in Gurgaon are from these very high net worth backgrounds and many of them are deeply depressed today because they find no purpose in what they are doing because they've spent so many years of their life chasing material wealth and money. So nothing against people who do want money, I think it's a very, you can do a lot of good for the world when you have a lot of money. But also one of the things that I am taught me about what not to do is that chase. I saw it very early and I figured out very early that that's not the path for me. So that way it kind of strongly molded the person I am."

And I think it was of men in USA if I remember correctly, but it certainly applies in my mind best there. What they found was that you have this curve where you go gradually downwards in terms of happiness until your mid 40s or late 40s. And then you suddenly start becoming much happier. And his explanation for this is that that is around the time you realize that all your life you felt you behaved as if your happiness is contingent on money. And by that time, mid 40s, late 40s, you've made all the money in the world, and you haven't been happy. And then you realize this is not where happiness lies. And it lies wherever then is for people to define it for themselves where happiness lies, but at least they know what not to do, as you said, and then they turn elsewhere and then true happiness kind of comes and I'm of course in my late 40s, but I've never really made much money here. Heated indoor swimming pool, mere paas hota toh main gareepon pe baad deta, main kya karunga heated indoor swimming pool, but, but yeah, I mean, so that's, that's, again, the fact that there's no correlation between money and happiness, toh pata hi hai, but it's kind of sad if these sort of mindsets are being propagated. So after you finished your MBA, you know, you eventually landed up in the civil services, but take me through that journey of your deciding ki kya karna hai aur waha pe kyu gaye, like, did you decide while doing your MBA that, you know, you want to go for the civil services or was the civil services always an attractive option, you know, like when I was growing up, it was always, you know, doctor medical toh hai hi, but IAS ka exam though, that is a, you know, the biggest prestige and obviously I grew up in the 70s and 80s where, you know, the state was all powerful. So even more so there, private sector toh zyada tha hi nahi and me being a rebel and my father already being in the IAS, I was like mujhe nahi karna, main toh writer banunga, main attic mein staff karunga and then I will make a lot of money and have an indoor swimming pool with my books too, well, none of that happened. But so what was your sort of journey like in that regard?"

And at that time, the done thing was Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, BCG, in mein jao, day zero placement that was a thing in IMK, there was a placement season and day zero is when the best firms with the best money and the international postings will come. Then day ones mein thoda sa desi firms will come, then day two, three pe aayo toh you are the leftovers. That was the, it was a very strong hierarchy like that and there was a summer placement at the end of one year, first semester actually, at the end of the first trimester itself, there was a summer placement for the end of one year wala summer break mein jaa ke aap do maheena internship karte ho, toh wo internship mein where you got placed kind of seals your fate in terms of where your life will head is, at least that was a popular notion and also that also seals how your peers see you. So your peers are also all trained to see you as yeh day zero person hai, yeh day one person hai, yeh day two person hai and that's the caste system in which we will also make our friendships now.

So I got placed on what was called day 0.5, they came up with a new thing, which was like the second day ki subah-subah there were some leftover Indian firms but were offering international postings. So I got into ICICI in London. So ICICI was a very tame compared to all the formidable brands that came the day before but it was a posting in London, so it was, so I often would say that I am the poorest intern living in London because I literally had to mouth existence given the daily allowance I was getting from them. But my peers who were all other in the fancy firms of London were all living it up while I was like yeh sandwich khaya jaye ke na khaya jaye, 2 pound ka hai, always converting to rupees in my head. But yeah, so it was like a semi-respectable internship that I got. And again, at that time it was heartbreaking and shattered your self-esteem, like I said, it was very, very depressing, that experience. But again, in hindsight, I think, like you said, you know, your life would be so different if you're born in privilege. I think my life would also have been very different if on that day I had cracked an interview. So that extreme string of many, many failures was actually, I think, good in the long run because it gave me some distance from the whole craziness that was going on in that system. And then that also kind of shaped the friends I made later. And hum sab day one wale chote log apne-apne friendships banate the. So we would, and that kind of gave me a lot more reality check of this is what real people are like. I know a lot of people also on this campus, not everyone is success crazy. And so, so that was good. So we were talking about UPSC, I'm sorry. So then uske baad, by the time the final placements ka time aaya, it so happened that we were also the recession year. So the subprime crisis hit in 2009 and 2008-ish and 2009 was the year of my final placements. So basically it was like campus pe sanata, day zero pe chaar firms aayi hain, kyuki baaki toh logon ko Lehman Brothers se PPO holte the, pre-placement offer, ki aapne summer internship itni achchi kari, ki we are giving you a job right now. So logon ko Lehman Brothers se PPO aaya, unhone partyan di, saara saar aash kiya aur that day they are realizing it doesn't exist anymore. So it was a huge shock for our campus and for like all the IMs were struggling and placements were down for everybody. And for me it was, I thought theek hai, anyway apna toh hona nahi saa, badi firms mein toh kya hi fark padta hai. But for me by that time, I had kind of made up my mind that I want to join a smaller firm where first of all, like we said na, headlight fallacy ki itna hi dikh raha hai, toh kya nahi karna hi dikh raha hai, toh finance nahi karna tha, yeh dikh raha tha, because people from investment banks would come in their placement talks and tell us with great pride about how I used to work 22 hours a day and I slept on a couch in my office on the 36th floor in New York on so-and-so Avenue, and I'd be like, good for you man, I don't want that life for myself. So finance nahi karna hai, itna clear tha, so I was like, the other option is consulting, jaise doctor aur engineer hota hai na, waise finance aur consulting hota hai. So then I thought, theek hai consulting mein kahin try karenge, maybe in a smaller firm because like I said, bade wale mein toh apna chance hi nahi hai. So then I was, I got into this small firm which was, I mean they were, I think they had 13 employees at that time, and it was the first time they were hiring from IIMs, and we were brought in, 7 of us were hired from IIM Ahmedabad in Bangalore. By the 6th month of joining that company, 6 of them had left, 7 mein se, and I was the only one left. I think there was a lot also to do with the culture because many of my peers had prior work experience, so they came with an expectation of what a company should be like, how it should be run. Whereas this was a very small firm, and it was very individual driven. So the founder, his thoughts, his philosophies were how the company operated. So and everyone had to basically accept that his way is the right way, and the other way is exit. So by 6th month, I realized everybody else had left, and they had also, the firm had decided that IIM people ka culture is not for us, ye log bahut they have, they had their own rationale for why people quit, and the people who quit are still friends, they had their own rationale for why they quit. Anyway, I persevered because I somehow found a middle ground where I was not accepting complete devotion either, but also not so uncomfortable that I had to move out. It also helped being a fresher because I had no prior experience, so there was no baseline with which to compare what a working culture in a professional organization should be. So 3 years I stayed in that firm, and my client was State Bank of India. I can say that was now made public. So there was a project we were doing there called Citizen SBI, which was how do you, there are I think 2 lakh employees in State Bank of India, and how do you make them all feel like citizens of State Bank of India, how do you make them think like contributors, you know, not just like people clocking in and clocking out, but find purpose in their work and therefore help communities around them. So great idea, and I did, I was in what they call the business modeling team, which meant I, you should travel across the country and take pilot projects in various communities with the SBI branch at the center. So I traveled to some tapioca farmers in Salem, some petni sari weavers in Nashik, some stone carvers in Konark in Odisha. So across the country I would travel to these communities, talk to these people, figure out what is their value chain, where is the gap, can it be filled with finance or can it be filled with skill development. So like stone carvers for example, their big problem is that all the men have migrated to Rajasthan for carving and all the women or unskilled people are left behind and they have to manage somehow and there's a lot of problems, migration, poverty, yes sir. So there was a skill development initiative needed there. So SBI did a partnership with NABARD and Bhola inko theek hai, we'll do this here. And I mean there were different inputs that were given, but State Bank kind of was for the first time thinking from the perspective of the community. So it was not a sales, typical sales methodology of the calls we get na, madam card lelo, madam loan lelo. So it wasn't like that. I mean I got to see a glimpse of real India right, for the first time. So far I've only seen this IIT, IIM ka posh world and their own first world problems. So for the first time I'm seeing what real India looks like, what the problems of real people of India are. And I realized that just a financial institution has this immense potential to change their lives. And I would see that there's like legitimate, tangible transformation happening in their lives and their quality of living, in their income, because of small, small initiatives that we made like a training program, zara saag. To us it's nothing and to them it's the difference between two very different standards of living. And so my mom and dad had mentioned UPSC before, after MBA or around that time. But I kind of dismissed it at that time as, you know, like you said, old world thinking ki haan, aapke zamane mein sarkari hota tha, ab nahi hota hai. And the joke was that somebody from our campus got placed in McKinsey and he told his father and father said, kya hua, Punjab National Bank hire nahi kar raha tha? So that was a joke ke our parents' generation doesn't understand what our aspirations are. So we were kind of all trained to ignore it. So UPSC ka, they had put it on the table but I had never given it much thought until I saw this experience. I had this experience and then I realized that my dad would tell me that he was also a public sector banker and how the collector would hold meetings of 20 bankers, 20 banks in front of him or her and tell them ki aap yahaan pe yeh karenge, aap wahaan pe woh karenge, aap us community ko loan denge, aap ye cheez mein help karenge, yahaan pe disaster hogaya, yahaan relief mein aap funding karenge. So like, then I realized that, oh my God, there is an organization behind these financial institutions which has even more of a transformative power. So for me, that was the point where I suddenly realized that, you know, this is something worth trying at least. I was told when I started applying ke, haan, bohot lamba process hota hai. It is. UPSC is a very long, one-year-long exam and very few people clear it. And I was working already. Like, people sit at home for years and years and prepare for it and go to coaching classes and live away from home in coaching centers. But and I'm here, I'm like doing a full-time job, traveling around the place and also thinking ke UPSC kar lenge. So, reality check shuru se tha, many people have told me, ke bohot kam chance hai, but try kar lo kya harz hai. Ek baar try kar lena, nahi hoga, agle saal achche se did dina. So that was the attitude going in. And so, the format of UPSC, for those who don't know, I'll just explain is, one, there is a multiple choice screening test which happens, in my time it used to happen somewhere around June-ish. Then around August-September mein uska result aayega, October-November mein there'll be a mains exam. Mains exam is nine written papers of three hours each. I don't want to go into details of what all, but general studies, selective subjects, language subjects, kar-kar ke nau paper, satta-ees gante ke exams over a week or two weeks. And woh clear hua toh, screening clear hua toh, mains aur mains clear hua toh, next year around the same time, March wagara mein aapka interview call. Aur phir woh bhi clear hua, toh you are in, otherwise agle June mein firse screening likho. So that's the cycle which many people are in, and often aspirants end up spending five, six, seven years in that cycle. So for me, it was a very clear thing ki I didn't want to write it again and again. I felt like ki yaar, these are my formative youth years, I don't want to spend them preparing for some exam that nobody gets through. I'm going to give it one shot, hua toh hua, nahi hua toh, thank you, bye-bye. So luckily for me, maine kuch prepare nahi kiya tha, but usse saal, there was a thing introduced called CSAT, which is Civil Services Aptitude Test, which is a cat ka bacha test. So because maine cat kiya hua tha, that exam was very easy for me and I sailed through. And later, if you look back around that time, 2012, there were a lot of protests that this CSAT gives an advantage to people like me essentially, people who have had the privilege of coaching in CAT and MBA and all that and engineers, because most of Indian students don't have that. And for them, cracking a logical aptitude data reasoning exam is, is much harder. And so anyway, there was a whole protest about that, but I was in that lucky year, which skimmed through because of that. So woh hogaya and then I got a call for my mains, that was around August and I was like kya 2 mahine mein exam hai and these are these 27 hours of paper that I have to write with, I have zero knowledge right now. I mean, you have no need to know things like public administration, constitution of India, freedom struggle of India, woh sab, was the farthest things from my mind, I was living a very different life. So I thought ki 2 mahina I'll just take sabbatical and again, thankfully small company, very personalized culture. So I told my boss that aisa aisa hua hai, I've gotten through this exam, I want to give it one serious attempt. Nahi hua toh I'm coming back to you, can I take 2 months off? So they were kind enough to say haan theek hai jao, jeelo apni zindagi. So I came to Delhi and I, so I used to work in Bombay, by the way, all these 3 years. So I came to Delhi and ghar pe baith ke padhai wadahi shuru kari, thoda bohot pata kiya coaching centers and people are like, this was in 2011, and people are like, achha aapko 2013 ki preparation kar diya hai na, aaye aaye yeh enrollment. So nahi mujhe, 2 mahine baad 11 ki exam ki, they're like, ho hi nahi sakta madam. People were just on my face, told me ki I don't want to steal your money and then give you false hope. Nahi hua sakta. And then some people did make efforts to steal my money and said, ek lakh rupay de do kar denge. So either way, kuch nahi chal raha tha. Then I found out there was this group circle of fellow aspirants, all of them studying together and doing group study somewhere in Noida. So I started, roz apna scooty utha gaye subah ghar se, maha gaye 2-3 ghanta suna baith ke, kya baatein chal rahi hain, achha Mahatma Gandhi, Champaran Satyagraha, abhi ye baatein chal rahi hain, chalo thoda bahut sun liya. And then, I mean, borrow notes from people and someone gave a photocopy of some coaching class ka notes and wo sab pad liya. The two subjects I had to take, I chose public administration and sociology, which was a very idealistic move on my part because I thought I ideally could have taken an engineering or logical reasoning subject which would have given me an edge, but I was like, ke dekho, hona toh hai nahi. Toh why waste reading, time reading stuff that I already know, let me learn something new about the country, this is a good opportunity to do that. I'll go back to my job with some value added. So that's why I took these two subjects. And then I took one, idhar udhar se photocopy notes, Police Act of 1861 mein kya hua tha, usme ye uske flaws kya hain, aur future mein kya reforms are necessary, so and so committee iss saal mein baith ki unke ye recommendations the, over 200 years, all the recommendations that have been given and ignored by government of India, wo sab pada, things like that, very very hardcore stuff which normal people, engineers, MBAs don't know this stuff, right, like I didn't. So wo sab I got very familiarized with all that. I think my writing really helped because my writing skills are decent and I'm able to express complicated thoughts, process them into simpler words and churn out a very understandable, comprehensible presentation of it. So that really helped, I think, with me. That was my biggest strength. So somehow I cleared mains and that was very shocking to everyone, including myself. Ki iska kaise ho gaya, ye toh, abhi toh aayi thi. And then I remember I had had a minor surgery on my leg and I was like, wo kharke, I was bedridden and wheelchair chal rahi thi ek hafte tak. And I was, tab khabar aayi that you've cleared and I was like, days, then I said, acha, and then I passed out again because I was under a lot of pain medication. And then I woke up and I was like, I had this weird dream. And my parents were like, nahi sahi me hua hai, it wasn't a dream. So then within a month I had that interview. So I took thoda extension of that leave for my surgery and gave the interview and it was a very, I mean, luckily I'd heard all these horror stories about stress interviews and all, woh bahut interview aur uth ke beech mein chala jaata hai, tum pe chillane lagta hai, ye sab aisa kuch nahi hua, they were very civil and nice and we had a good conversation about my academics, my IIM experience, going to Germany, ye sab baate baate hui, thoda bahut aaj ki newspaper se ye pada, wo cheez ka reform batao, uske baar mein tumhara, some textbook questions that are there. For the most part I did well, I thought, and actually I did quite well because ultimately I cleared it and when the mark sheet came, I realised that I'd only just made it through the mains exam with a very small margin, but my interview went really exceedingly well, which is why I finally made it to the cut off. So interview mein I might have been among the toppers in the country, but because mains was very bare minimum passable marks. So my rank was I think some 601 or something and there's only 1000 civil servants selected in a year, out of, by the way, 6 lakh applicants in my year. So I was selected and I got into this animal called the Indian Information Service, which I had never heard about, nobody's heard about it, let's be honest, I'll give one toffee to any listener of Seen and the Unseen who writes back saying mujhe pada tha yeh service"

And luckily, it wasn't and it was a very good example of bad writing, I have to say. So, haan, so I got into this service and then it was, ke yaar hua toh hai nahi, aaye is kya fark padta hai, chh rahne dete hain, jaane dete hain. And then people advised ke nahi, dekho, try toh kar lo, ek baar join toh kar lo, let's see, nahi hua toh chhod dena and ho gaya. If you find it good, it can be life-changing, which it obviously is. And the, I did a little bit of digging into it and found out what, what this service does in the first place, hi hota kya hai. And I thought that basically it's a service that handles all the media of the government, which is Doordarshan News, All India Radio, DEAVP, which was, which is an organization now called, I think BOC, which is now, an organization which does all this chhapoing of government ads, which you see all over, a bit of community radio or some grassroots communication also. And press releases, of course, PIB. So Press Information Bureau is the PR agency of Government of India in a way. And that's the agency which organizes press conferences with ministers and you write press releases for your ministry and that's how the media gets to know what your ministry or what the government is doing. So I was like, ek potential, one thing that really attracted me for this service was that, you know, making people aware of their rights. The grassroots communication, which is a very small part of it, was the one that attracted me the most because I felt like, as an, as an Indian, I don't know what are the schemes that the government has. And of course, I'm privileged enough to not need many of those benefits also. But even people who do need those benefits genuinely are often not aware that these are the things that are our rights and we can demand these rights from the government, ki hume ghar mein shochale chahiye, hona chahiye, we need it, we want it, it is our right. Something like this, people don't have the awareness to even, let alone demand, the agency to demand the right, not even the awareness to know the right. So for me, that was the big hook and attraction of this service, that I can generate public awareness about rights of citizens. And so I thought, theek hai, kar lete hain, join. And that's how I got in the long answer to your short question about how UPSC happened."

        "message": "So this is another very long story. So basically I get in, September of 2012 is when the training started. So first you have to do a three-month foundational course training, which every service has to do. And after that, depending on what service you are, you do a specialized training. So there's IAS, IFS, IPS, un sab ki apni-apni academy, apni-apni training ho rahi hai. But shuru mein, everyone congregates in one academy, used to congregate in one academy, which was the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy in Mussoorie. Now as the batch, that was when the batch sizes were 200-300 people, your dad's time maybe. Now as the batch sizes have grown, they are not able to fit everyone in Mussoorie. IAS, IPS, IFS, fahan jaayenge pahad mein padhne, baaki log jahaan jahaan girenge, maa girenge. So I fell in Nagpur. There is an academy called National Academy of Direct Taxes, which is the specialized academy for IRS, income tax service. And wahan pe, they used to do foundation course for some other leftover services, which included mine. And lot of my batchmates were from Forest Service, which was very interesting because they have, they are the only service which has a different exam. All the rest of us came from one exam, UPSC ka. So Forest Service people were, a lot of batchmates were from the Northeast and it was a good experience that way. Three months we spent together and it's very intensive, they will take you on a trek to the Himalayas and then they do one Bharat Darshan, I've traveled to Andaman and Leladakh, everything in one, happening in one month, you're traveling here to there. So it was very, very intensive and very interesting. And then, but yeah, there was one thing that was disillusioning right from the beginning, which is when I came in and I came in with these naive idealistic notions of the why would be the same for everyone, that why is, why do you join civil service, to serve your country, to do better for society. For me, that was the most obvious answer. When I come in, I realize that I am a very small minority, the people who've come in with that perspective. So a lot of people have come in for power, a lot of people have come in for prestige, some people have come for corruption. So some people have come just for, ab hum unko dikhayenge, jino ne humein press kiya. And I mean, at the outset, obviously, there's this judgmental lens, which I'm already bringing in, right, that my way was better than their way. But when you talk to people, and you hear their life stories, you realize that you asked me earlier about how our upbringing shapes us, you know, and that's, this is a very stark example of it. And I think we've discussed this before offline, which is, like one of my batchmates told me that he's from what is called the backward caste and wo boltha hamaare gaon mein we were always treated as untouchables, humari maa ko khana nahi milta tha, humko itni mushkil se bada kiya, and ye caste wali log humko dabate the, ab hum unko dikhayenge, ab hum unko dabayenge, ab main gaon jaunga, laal batti ki gaadi mein aur main unko dikhaunga. So I mean, like I'm saying, you know, from a very urban and this idealistic mindset of all is good with the world, it seems very shady ke arey aap yahan pe power aur dabane ek doosre ko aayo, ye petty politics karne aayo, desh ki seva karo. But when you get to know their stories, you realize that, well, if you were born in that place, you might also have grown up thinking like this. So it's all logical, but it's also unfortunate. So there was a lot of this thing about arey IS ko laal batti ki gaadi milti, humein kyu nahi milti hai, hum is service mein hain, hum bhi toh ye kar rahe hain, hum itne senior officer hain, humara, jab hum office aayenge toh humara dabba uthane ke liye ek peon aana chahiye neeche, humein gaadi ka darwaza koi aur kholega, hum kyu kholege, hum desh ke civil servant hain. So I mean, there's a lot of that, which is the overwhelming majority."

Even in IIM, my male batchmates would discuss it, ke IITN ho gaye, ek crore dowry ho gayi, ab IIM bhi kar liye, ab do crore dowry ho gayi. Ab iske upar civil service kar lo, toh soch lo kya ho jayega, hai na? Toh phir politician ki beti se shadi kar lo, phir wahan pohat jao, baad mein mantri ban jaoge, toh phir life toh take off kar gayi ekdum. So all of these are life plans that people come in with. And genuine, serious life plans, it's not comical to them, it's very serious. People live these lives and people see real value in it. And again, from their perspective, it makes a bit of sense also, as unfortunate as it is for the country. So yeah, that's also where I met Salil, my husband, because he was in income tax doing his specialized training there, two years senior to me. And I think I was talking to him last night about what I'll tell you about how we met and I said that, you know what, whether we like it or not, we bonded a lot over this solitude that we both felt, you know, that we are like these, I don't want to make it sound too dramatic, but we are these people, few hand-picked people, you can count them on fingertips, who have genuinely come here with that perspective, who want to learn, who want to listen in class, how can I contribute in my service in the future, who are not here, let's bunk the class, it's done now. So you know, that clearing of UPSC, the big difference is, there is a small group of people who see it as the beginning of their journey, but there's an overwhelming majority who sees that as the culmination. Now life is set. Now we don't need to study, we don't need to work hard, this is what we were aiming for, this is why we slogged for five years, seven years at home, and finally we've made it in life and this is it, life has come to a full stop. Now we have to enjoy it. So as, I'm sorry, I'm sure I sound very ungrateful to the environment."

I mean, by the way, in real India, people are washed with milk, and they are worshipped, and their aarti is performed, and there are big rallies that our boy has cracked UPSC. Anyway, I was obviously a very urban, lost in crores of people in Mumbai, one of them, so I was surprised that somebody even knew that I lived in Bombay and invited me to this thing, and he was there to kind of welcome the youngsters joining the service, and he gave an address there, which to this day I remember, he said, there are three things that you need as a civil servant, one is integrity, which is basic, he's like, this is hygiene, so don't go out being very proud about, I am a very honest officer, this is the bare minimum for you, and he's like, I know plenty of honest officers who go to office with their lunch box and come back home, so they didn't do any work, so what's the point of honesty, you're garrowing a huge flag of it. Of course, many people don't even meet that criteria, but that is, for you, it should be a hygiene, it should not be something to feel pride in. Second is competence, which is often very badly lacking, and I want to circle back to that, which is the point I sent to you about problem with UPSC and therefore the country. Anyway, second is competence, that you should be able to do your job or be willing to pick up the skills needed to do it. And third was the willingness to contribute. So you can be very competent and honest, but still not make an effort, because like I said, this job is incentivized to be a culmination, because you'll meet 60-year-old, 65-year-old, 70-year-old men who still remember, that 35 years ago, I had written a public administration exam, and I had scored this much in that exam, and if I had scored 2 marks more, then my rank would have been this, and I would have gotten this service, and I would have gotten this carder. It's insane to me that I have met 60-65-year-old men who remember their scores from UPSC. I have forgotten my score, but people remember, and that too in a sectional, in a subject paper, if this mark had come, then this impact in life."

Even your retirement age, at what position you'll retire, what money you'll be making at that age, you can all predict everything on day one in the academy when you're in your training. So because all of that is figured out, and there's going to be time-bound promotions. Unless you murder somebody, you might not be, you will not be fired.

And it was sexual harassment, there are eyewitnesses, his own batchmates know it. The girl felt it, woke up, caught him, red-handed, no action was taken. Why? Because kaun karega itna paperwork, agli 20 saal tak hum log ko yaha bulaya jayega Nagpur mein gawahiyan dene. Even the girl is like, yaar, mera toh poora career yahi ban jayega, isi ke waale me gawahi dena. So now that person is a civil servant in government of India, getting his dabba picked by somebody. So I mean, that's the way the system is designed. It is designed for you to be complacent and not want to grow, not want to contribute. So that was what Mr. Jayaprakash Narayan had said, those three things which I still remember to this day, that model office. And I often look at people from that lens also and I find that one of the three or sometimes many, more than one of the three are lacking in many officers, sadly."

        "message": "Yeah, so I didn't stay long enough in the system to do an analysis beyond what I have so far. But I'll tell you what I have so far. First step itself is the exam is wrong. One exam for a 23 or something services, right? So you are all writing the same exam. All of you have the same dream, which is IAS, collector banna hai, laal batti, gaon mein jaake my baap bannege, log humare pyaar pakdenge, hum unko relief denge. And for various other things, somebody wants to contribute as a collector, somebody wants to have their dabba picked as a collector, doors open. But for various reasons, everyone wants IAS, right? Or some people want IFS, which is for London mein wine peeenge. So again, not to belittle people's drivers, they are genuine, very good civil servants I know who have great reasons for wanting these things. I was one of them. I wanted IAS for that reason, contribution. But you have these 25 other services, which nobody else is thinking about, which all of these people who want one service are going to fall into one of those buckets. So shuru mein hi uss job mein ek insaan aa raha hai, jise woh job chahiye hi nahi thi. For whom that job was never a dream, it was never a priority. And because it was never a dream, then not something that they wanted, they are often also not suited for that job. So you will have all sorts of people randomly falling in all different buckets. And it's a lot of chance, right? On that day. Like I know a senior of mine who likes to say ki us din examiner ghar pe jagda karke aaye tha aur uski gobi kacchi bani thi aur uski upar fan nahi chal raha hai, isli tumhare marks kam aa gaye, kyuki wo gusse mein usne check kiya tumhara paper. Aur tumhara doosre peers ka, usne kisi tumhara peer ne ganda paper likha, but uska exam paper went to an evaluator who was in a great mood sitting in an air-conditioned room eating a pizza. So he's happy and he gave good marks. So it's a very, very luck-based system, right? Which is fair, theek hai, it's a large-scale exam. There will be an element of luck, like you said, in everything in life there is. But you have this luck-based system se people randomly falling in random buckets, right? And so now an accountant falls in the bucket of police officer. The person who didn't want that job is not, is not designed for that job physically, mentally, and is just not geared up for the requirements of being a police officer, is randomly put in that role now. There were people in my service who didn't know what email is, and they are now supposed to communicate for Government of India. Like I used to literally after hours teach extra classes to my peers ki chalo bhaiyon thodi baith jo ek email sikha deti ho, aapko ek cheez hoti hai, kyuki you are going to go and handle communication for this country. As my contribution in this, at this stage, I can't do much, but at least I can educate my peers about something. So these are people who never wanted to write, who have no interest to this day in writing, in communicating. But I was luckily someone who had a communication mindset who fell accidentally in this bucket. But plenty of people who had no inclination or desire to do this with their lives have fallen into this bucket. So that's why I said the forest service peers were a great experience for me because they were people who wanted forest service, you know, they were zoology, biology, graduates, they were people from the northeast who had grown up in forests and knew that economy of a forest, how that value chain works, how those communities function, what is the importance of protecting wildlife, what is a difference between a sandalwood tree and a neem tree, which person like me has no idea. But I will never accidentally fall in the forest bucket because I didn't write that exam. They have fallen into that because they consciously chose to write that exam. So the first thing that I think this country needs to change big time is have separate exams for each service. If you are a person who wants to do asset liability, taxation, you should write the IRS exam. If you're an English graduate, then don't write that IRS exam, you're not suited for it, you don't even want to do it, you won't be happy doing it and you'll do a bad job. So that's number one to me. Biggest flaw is this one gateway for multiple entries. And which is why people other than IAS, usme bhi log dhukhi hain, but other than IAS, zyadatar log are spending their life in grief and what ifs. What if I had got two more marks more in geography paper, then I would be there, not here. And it's unfair to that office that a person who has no inclination of being there, who doesn't take pride in that office, and who doesn't take the potential of that office and the responsibilities of that office seriously is sitting in that office for the next 30 years, mind you, with no way of moving away. Skipping forward to the reason I quit was also this because I would see seniors who were 30 years, 35 years senior to me and still talking about marks. There was a, I remember ek INB secretary ka farewell tha. This is the other thing, ke secretary IAS banenge. So an IAS person who has spent their life in the INB ministry will never rise to the secretary of that ministry. The secretary will be someone who's come from rural development agriculture ministry."

But then ultimately after a while I realized this is a consolation speech he's giving because he's telling us that you should have pride in what you do, you should not take it to heart that you didn't make it and I was like, make it where for a second and then I realized he's talking still about, woh tumhare waha pe marks nahi aaye the acche, toh isliye ab is aadmi ko apne retirement ke din pe bhi wahi marks yaad aare hain and even as an IAS he's giving us consolation and I see my seniors with their heads hanging, taking that consolation and thinking haan amare saath hua toh bohot bura but you're right, maybe we should take heart in this. People who are living with such deep regret should not be in these offices, they are doing an injustice, a disservice to the office. And so I would see that, I mean I tried to, tried a lot to make change happen, tried a lot to reform things, but then reform would happen when it would come from the top. Like 2014, Modi government comes and says, social media karna hai, toh suddenly sabko karna hai. Usse pehle I was putting proposal pe proposal that we should have a more active presence on social media, nothing, no change, ye tum bachon ka kuch khel hai, we are not interested, you youngsters only know, we don't know what this is. And fair point, you don't know, but that's not a good enough reason to not do something that is useful for the service for the country. But then when it came from the top, it happened and overnight everyone was on Twitter. So that's when I realized ki yaar, I'm just spending a lot of my productive years and energy and effort and passion into just pushing against a wall that's not going to move because of my push. So the job I was also in, after my training ended, I was, around that time was May 2014. And during my training itself, I had done these on-the-job training rotations. And in DD News, I had launched a campaign on sustainable urban transport, like from scratch I read up on the subject, I went and interviewed experts and I would take a camera team with me to shoot their interviews. And then I got funding from, allocated from DD News to, ki yeh karenge chaar hafte ka campaign. I personally got like Rahul Bose ko phone kar ko aake uska kahin se manager ka number dhoond ke, got him as our host for the show. Got all these experts from various fields, talking about non-motorized transport, need for bicycle tracks on our roads, need for more buses instead of more metros. How highways are not going to solve the problem of traffic jams because that is like trying to put out a fire with petrol. So, all of these concepts which are not obvious to most of us, I educated myself on them and then I worked on designing a campaign. And that caught the eye of one of my seniors, who was, once the new government came in in 2014, he was posted in the PMO. So, he said that I want these two-three young officers in my team. So, I was one of those people handpicked for this thing. And then I got posted in PIB in Prime Minister's office. So, basically handling PMO's publicity for PIB. So, those press releases I would write would be, Shri Narendra Modi went today to Madison Square Garden and delivered an address and yeh wo. So, it was a obviously very, very prestigious job and arguably the best job you can have. Actually, the best job you can have at that age and stage of your career in that service was what I got right out of academy. Actually, I wasn't even allowed to finish academy, they said we are picking you out of the process. Karne toh baaki training poori, tum aajao bahar. So, I was pulled out of the academy middle of my training and picked up for this. So, it was a huge honor, obviously, very, very prestigious and, but over time, what started happening was that I, we used to have this very hectic lifestyle, you know, get up at 4 a.m., 3 a.m. kyunki 4 a.m. tak office pohoshna hota hai and then you make a media report for the Prime Minister, ke subah jab wo uthenge, toh wo kitni akbaare ek insaan padhega, unke paas time nahi hai. So, I would read 20 newspapers, Hindi, English, vernacular, put together news that is being written about the government, about the Prime Minister, about so and so ministry, about yesterday's event that happened, what people are saying about his speech, things like that, like make a full digest that goes to the PM and with their morning chai, the Prime Minister reads this. So, this has been happening forever, it's not new to this government, but I was like"

It's the same thing that I have to do over and over again. There is zero scope for mistakes. It's always urgent, because always right now, PM is making a statement at 8pm, so it's very high stress. It is any hour of day or night, 24-7, he's working, so you're working. And then ultimately, you're not really learning anything new beyond a point.

So anyway, so yeah, I mean, all of those factors kind of combined, and I felt like it was not the best place for me anymore. And the interesting thing is that when I decided to quit, most of my seniors were very supportive of it, they were even enthusiastic of it. Some of them would even message me, to this day, some of them messaged me that you took such a courageous step that we could never take, and I wish at your age I had done this. And then I had, of course, an exit interview with our MOS, who was Mr. Rajvatar Singh Rathore. And then the minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley, he signs off finally on your resignation. And then, uske baad, bye bye. There were some people also who got very offended by my decision. And again, I felt like that showed a bit of low self-esteem when you are offended by somebody else's life decision about themselves that, you know, it's like, if I say that, I, Amit, I started a podcast, now I'm ending it and you feel offended. Aise kaise tum podcast end kar doge? What does that say about me? Are you saying that my life choice is wrong? You know, that's the sort of place that this comes from. So, I've had also seniors who would make me sit in their room and not sign my file because I used to physically go with the file, ki mujhe nikalna hai because I have another job lined up to join. And please yeh sign kar do, I used to physically go from office to office with my resignation file. So, I used to get these two extreme opposite reactions. One was so much pride, full support, I wish I had done this. And the other was, how dare you, tumhain himmat kaise hoi? What do you think of yourself? And you know, like, really personal stuff like that, I'm like, sir, just sign the file, I've never met you before, I don't intend to meet you again. Why do I matter to your life so much?

Well, I'd love to help you. Since April 2020, I have taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction. In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs Rs. 10,000 plus GST or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing. That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

Abhi log scene unseen sunenge Mahima Vashisht yaha aati hai. So you know, you sort of left government for the reasons you sort of described with great eloquence.

        "message": "and so forth. So like I said, I joined the government with a certain contributive aim in mind and I was somehow feeling that it was not getting fulfilled. So at least the results were not proportionate to the efforts and it seemed at some point that my efforts were actually meaningless in the larger scheme of things. The country was going where it would go, it's not like the civil services were going to lose out on a big thing if Mahima Vashisht was there or not. So with that, again, the same aim in mind of having an impact, I decided that maybe you know, I'll try my luck in the development sector. And I fortunately, around the time when I was contemplating and going through that inner turmoil of to stay or not to stay, I also, I started talking to friends and peers about the development sector and I found out that Tata Trusts was, had just been rebranded as Tata Trusts. So earlier they were these Jamshedji Trust, JRD Trust, very like some 20-25 trusts left by various people in the Tata lineage. And Mr. Ratan Tata was, had now recently co-branded them as one umbrella Tata Trusts as the brand and everything is under it. So there was a lot of reorganization happening because each trust had its own mandate, its own leadership and people were brought together, lot of change management happening inside and they wanted to bring some young blood also. So they were looking for people to hire and coming from a government background also gave me a certain edge, so I was offered a position in that team. So I literally just, I think my resignation got accepted on 30th November and 1st December I joined Tata Trust. So for a few months I was still figuring out my place, I was working with some dual leadership, one boss in Delhi, one boss in Bombay, it was working, not working, kuch kuch. Then one day the CEO of trusts called me and he said that there is a new leadership in the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and they work on Swachh Bharat Mission and they are looking for the, essentially there was a new secretary and he's been brought as a lateral hire, he's not come up the IAS ladder. Although he was ex-IAS, he left, went out and worked in the World Bank in the US and various other countries and now he's been brought in laterally to lead the Swachh Bharat Mission and he, because for him coming back to the government is a change, he wants people to come manage his office and help him set things up. So jao zara ek do hafta unki help kar do because you are familiar with the government system and then you can come back and resume what you are doing here. So like theek hai, I went, three of us were asked to go and he had said I want some youngsters and one was a very young colleague, another was a fresh IIM graduate and third was, I was the senior most in that team. And the three of us went and we sent our CV and everything to him and I was very impressed that this is a secretary who replies to email first of all. Literally, a secretary who checks his own email is a very rare species in government of India. And I remember I emailed him at night and within half an hour I got a response from him and he had clearly like got it on his phone, which is an accomplishment again, email on their phone. Not have a PS jo kamre ke bhaar baithe aur Monday ko print out lekar aaye sir ye email ka, not that, so very impressed. And then, so we went in and so he was a career sanitation person because he had worked in the World Bank as in the sanitation sector and then he was clearly very knowledgeable about the sector and he had very clear ideas on where he wanted to take things. And basically Swachh Bharat Mission was as we know launched on 2nd October 2014 and this is happening in March 2016 and by this time, if you look at the data, the coverage hasn't moved much. So, the sanitation coverage of India at the time of independence was like 1%. So, 1% of Indians used the toilet and had access to a toilet even. Then over the years, still various sanitation programs happened in the country, Nirmal Bharat Abhyaan, usse pehle Total Sanitation Campaign, usse pehle kuch aur kuch aur. And over the years, coverage had come up only to 38% when as of Swachh Bharat launch. So, now the mandate given by the Prime Minister is paath saal mein ODF India, which is Open Defecation Free India and they had set themselves a very high bar of 100% coverage. So, I mean in some countries, ODF, Open Defecation Free is also defined when you achieve 70% coverage that okay, not enough people are anymore going out in the open to cause serious risk of diseases and infectious diseases. So, this is the, some threshold they decide, everybody agrees on ki haan, yahan tak pahunch pehle toh we'll call it ODF. India mein they went full ke hum dekh lenge, 100%."

So, that was the condition in which he had taken over and Mr. Parmeshwar Nair, by the way, his name I should have taken before, so he was, so he was very clear ke I am going to meet this target and the career bureaucrats before me have not taken this seriously because they've been like, dekho, first of all, sanitation is a state subject, toh hum baithe hain haan Delhi mein states ko, jab karna hoga kar lenge. Jab funding ka request aayega, hum sign kar denge file, toh ho gaya humara kaam. So that was the attitude before him, which is why we were where we were. So his thing was ke nahi, I have, I have been brought in for, on a contract. This is my main aim. Even if my contract gets extended, mujhe 2019, 2nd October ko ODF India chahiye hi chahiye, karna hi karna hai. So then, and he wanted his team to have the same enthusiasm, which is why he brought in fresh blood from outside because he was like, the current setup is of that mentality and so he did a lot of transfers and brought in new people and in the government service also. And so over the years, then he was very, we were quite aggressive and like we would call up collectors and be like, ye percent pe kyu ho, ye person se aage wo percent ho rachi hai. And I was working a lot more on the communication side of things because I had that background of government communication. So I worked a lot on campaigns for Swachh Bharat Mission. So you might have seen Darwaza Bandh, Amitabh Bachchan ka campaign, which is about ke toilet ka darwaza bandh karo, essentially. And there was a bit of gender that I had brought in in that, lengths that I had brought in there also. So there was, there is this instance that I want to highlight to kind of like give an example of the kind of work I was trying to do. So Nirmal Bharat mein, there were these ads, right? Ek Vidya Balan ka ad hota tha. By the way, full love, I am a big fan of Vidya Balan, but woh jo ad tha, that had some issues. Toh ad mein, she was a school teacher type, chashme wali lady, who goes into a village. Typical government ad ki gaon wale beb koof hote hain aur shahir wale aa ke unko samjhate hain ki jeevan aise jeena chahiye tumhe. Right? We will impart our urban wisdom and teach them how to live their life. So that was the typical model which all government ads have followed. Usme bhi ye hi tha. And then this ad is called Dulhan ki Vidai, aisa kuch naam hai iska. So the ad mein kya hai ki ek shadi ho rahi hai aur dulha dulhan baitha hu hai mandap mein, saas baitha hai side mein, ladke ki maa and ladki bolti hai mujhe paani peena hai. Toh koi paani ka glass laata hai aur woh ghoongat pehna hua hai usne, lamba, toh ghoongat utha ke paani peeti hai. And then the saas is immediately like, ishara karti hai ki neeche karo, ghoongat neeche. And then, so Vidya Balan notices this with a critical eye. And then later she says ki bahu ko shauchale jaana hai. Toh saas bolti ki shauchale kahan humare hain toh hum aisi bahar jaate hain. Toh woh bolti ki bahu fir toh tum ghoongat bhi khol do, kyuki ek taraf toh inko tumhara paani peene ke ghoongat uthana bhi gawara nahi hai, dusri taraf ye chahate hai ki tum bahar jaa ke khule mein shauch karo. Toh, I mean, that ad is supposed to say use a toilet obviously, but it's also in a way saying that aur toh ka ghoongat pehna is fair as long as there's a toilet at home, rakho unhe ghoongat, bandi wana ke, right? So it's not thinking that, but it is unintentionally saying that. So for me, a big part of it was also that there is this entire narrative about women being victims. Ke the victimhood of women, hamari mataon aur bhehnaon ko toilet nahi milta hai, bechari subhe tak rok ke rakti hain, bahot peeda hoti hai, bahot dukh milta hai unhe, unki izzat hume bachani hai, toh this mataon bhehnaon narrative really irritates me, first of all, because you should respect people because they're people, not because you have relatives of that gender. Right? Nobody says ki iss aadmi ka murder hone se rakho kyunki humare bhaiyon aur baapon ki raksha karne hai. No one says that. But aur toh yaar, there's always a mataon bhehnaon narrative. So that was one thing that I didn't like, and also there was painting of women as these passive victims who are sitting at home waiting to be rescued by the men. So I mean, my sense was that rural women have far more agency and they are able to even lead this movement because their incentives are aligned, it is in their interest. They don't want to go out and get assaulted by men in the dark in the fields because they went outside. And there's all sorts of things, there's animal attacks, there's children being kidnapped. I think there was that rape in one UP district where these girls had gone out basically for open defecation and it became a very, there were these very violent images that came out also later about how their bodies were hung from a tree or something."

        "message": "Right. So obviously, it is in the interest of women, in greater interest of women, because they stand much more to lose their suffering much more. But that doesn't mean that they are going to be passive victims sitting at home waiting to be rescued by their men. They can also lead this movement mostly because also they are mothers and they know that when their children fall ill, how it affects their children. And at this point, as a mother, you have this drive, this agency to protect your child. And if nothing else, not to protect themselves, at least to protect their children, they will want toilets and they can become champions of the movement. So that was the lens with which I wanted to communicate about Swachh Bharat. And so we got Anushka Sharma as the brand ambassador. So while everybody was very gung-ho about Amitabh Bachchan and very, very cool of Mr. Bachchan, he did it for free as he does with most government campaigns, and every brand ambassador does it pro bono. But then I wanted one woman ambassador who talks about this message also. And so there's an ad of Darwaza Band campaign featuring Anushka Sharma where you see women who are, you know, gheraing around a man who's going with a mug outside in the jungle. And there's these wives who have chained the mugs to the toilet. So the man tries to yank the mug away to go in the fields and he's not able to. And then two men look at each other that both our wives have chained and they're saying, please go use the toilet. Because we were also finding the data was showing that even once you build a toilet, it is the able-bodied young men who are the last to adopt. The senior citizens will adopt, the differently abled will adopt, children will do it, women will do it, but the young men are the problem area. So I said, women are not the problem, men are here the problem, so let's target men as the target segment which needs to change their behavior instead of saying, bichari aurat ki izzat bachalo. Because that messaging also means you build a toilet and then you go out in the jungle because you built it for your wife, not for yourself. And open defecation is one thing which affects everyone. It's not that I went out in the field and so only my health is affected because ultimately it's going to spread diseases which will come to everyone's house. So it's a community-wide effort. If even one person is going out, that was the message at least we said behind 100% coverage that even if one person goes out, your health is affected. And then there was a lot of learning around this sector. I remember the openness with which in that ministry we used to say the word tatti after a while. For the first time I remember there was this expert brought in who would keep saying the word tatti, tatti and I was giggling behind, I had to stand behind a colleague because I couldn't stop giggling and I thought it was unprofessional, but then again no one's heard of this talk in a boardroom setting. But it was a lot of fun, it was a lot of learning about again, you know, real issues of real India and how these issues are cross-cutting, they affect your family health, your finances. Because for a poor family, if a person who's earning falls ill x times a year, that much time of income doesn't come in, plus expenses of healthcare, women's agency to go out and work is limited if children are constantly falling ill in the house. So all of these things are interlinked with one little cause, which seems very banal at the outset, kya hai ek toilet bana do. So it was a great learning experience, five years. So I was there till 2020 and yeah, I mean, we declared India ODF and all the reality is obviously different. I mean, the National Family Health Survey recently came out and said it's not ODF, but that's beside the point. I think a lot of, the mission gets a lot of flack for this because we trapped ourselves into the narrative of ODF India karna hai, but that's not really the point. The point is that nowhere in the history of mankind, of humankind, has there been a government program that has led to this much change in sanitation coverage of this many number of people. So at the time we began, 650 million people, Indians would go out and defecate in the open and basically 1 billion in the world. So every second person defecating outside in the morning was an Indian. So that was the extent of the problem at that time and even if we've not solved it 100%, we've solved it 70%, 80%, it's something to be applauded, it's something to be celebrated. So the narrative of 100% versus other, well, not 100% is not the point which should be debated, but it is worth celebrating. I mean, whatever is your politics and I also have opinions on the politics of this government, but this mission has been an unqualified success in my view. If you look at it that way about the number of lives it has touched and improved forever."

        "message": "So yeah, ODL and ODF, but you know, it's also worth underscoring that that little point you made that, you know, open defecation affects everyone and an illness can be of great consequence to a poor family. And I don't think we city elites really understand how devastating a small illness can be, you know, I think economists use a term, I think welfare shocks, that essentially, you know, an illness can lead to a welfare shock in the sense that you can actually fall back into poverty, and then coming out can take another generation, you know, a slow movement upwards can suddenly reverse so hard. And you know, just so many people in cities, honestly, if they have a medical emergency, even they themselves will go broke in a day, right? So when you think of the poorest of the poor, it's just way worse, it can be devastating and something like this has a great impact. I'd done an episode on Swachh Bharat India a long time back with Shruti Rajgopalan, where the fundamental point she was making is that some of it was posturing in the sense that sure you build the toilets and you put the commodes in, you know, whatever, but the underlying drainage system wasn't there. And because the underlying drainage system wasn't there, the caste system got perpetuated because you inevitably have people from the lower caste forced to then come and take the refuse away. And therefore, a lot of the change was cosmetic, because people still kept going out. I think this episode would have been in 2018 or something. So possibly, you know, you were there till 2020. So maybe you guys managed to, you know, do something about the deeper underlying issues."

        "message": "Yeah. So, first of all, there is no sewage network in a rural area. It's too partially populated to justify the cost of laying down sewage pipelines. And it's too dynamic because new households are coming up every now and then, when one family, two sons are separated, two houses are built suddenly, right. So it's a moving target. So building a sewage system is impractical in most rural parts of India. So what we did have was a twin-pit toilet system, which is that under the toilet only, under the ground, there is a system. And the system is that there are two pits. So first all the waste flows into one pit, it fills up and the pit has a mitti ka bottom. So that pit fills up, you kind of just call your mistri and switch the drainage to the other pit. And that one pit fills up takes five years. And then the second pit filling up will take five years, utti der mein this first pit would have leached down into the ground and would have composted. And in an ideal well-constructed twin-pit toilet, that compost will become like manure, which you can use in the fields. So anyone can empty it and in fact, we went to several places, we've got our minister at the time, Mr. Narendra Singh Tomar, Akshay Kumar, the CAG of the time, my boss, the secretary himself, all of them, we've got these iconic people to go into a pit, pick out that waste with their hands and just to showcase that it is safe and it can be handled. And we even did an ad about that featuring Akshay Kumar and Bhoomi Pednekar later after the toilet movie came out. So just to highlight this, that this waste is safe to handle. So that's the, like I said, it's an ideally constructed, correctly constructed twin-pit, which I agree, sometimes the pit is not correctly constructed or people will just construct a single pit ke, bahut ghera gadda bana do ji, bhare hi na, agli 20 saal tak na bhare. Wo itna ghera gadda banate hain, to then it leaches into the water table, the waste, and it can contaminate your water. So there's technical issues with it. But theoretically, that model exists and was the one that we at least pushed from Delhi and most states did adopt it, if not all. The second question was about caste. Caste is a very real problem that cannot be disentangled from sanitation. And it's even worse in urban areas where you see manual scavengers going inside the septic tanks and not coming back, right. There were so many deaths of sanitation workers in Delhi alone in the recent past. So obviously, caste is not an issue that you can ever disassociate from it. Having said that, there were critics that, academicians who we worked with at that time and we would consult them, but often found their way of doing things to be very idealistic. So the purest view is, first you solve caste, then you solve sanitation. That is the purest way of approaching it, ke pehle caste system hatao, aur ye bolo ki koi bhi toilet saaf karega, uske baad toilets banao, so that anyone is actually, you know, the way Shruti has perceived the toilets to be cleaned and managed."

But the purest view of caste system ko jab tak solve nahi karenge tab tak India ODF nahi hum sakta was like, we don't have 200 years to wait around to do that. So we were like, ke dekho, we have a limited frame of window, paanch me se bhi 3 saal bache hain, and we have to do this. At least construct the infrastructure for it and do a certain amount of behavior change communication to change people's behavior and encourage use of these toilets. And beyond that, I think problems like caste are going to get solved as we develop, as we get more educated as a society. It's going to happen in its course of time and hopefully we'll have some accelerators along the way. But it was not something that was in our area of control or could have been practically"

        "message": "So yeah, I told you beforehand about my earliest memories of writing and 3rd standard, my English teacher, she used to compulsorily write a page of a diary every day. And I was, as the class topper, designated the class monitor who had to check other people's diaries. I used to have like a lot of, I think that teacher gave me a lot of anxiety because I used to wake up in the middle of the night and check whether I had written or not. I was like, it was a problem, a serious problem. But anyway, so that was my first introduction to disciplined daily writing. And like you said, 4th standard, I got published and I was very proud that in the school magazine, there was a thing about how, it was a very cute essay, I came across it recently, that's why I still remember it, which is about how, you know, mom says we should not tell a lie, but then how is Colgate also number one toothpaste and Close Up also number one toothpaste. As a child, I'm seeing on TV, various guys are saying I'm number one, someone is lying. So what's going on in the world of adults? It was very cute. I mean, I mean, I used to get these small encouragements, I think, from my environment about, yes, she is good at English, she writes well. And then cut directly to college where all those magazines and all those things happened. I was a chief editor of an official magazine and an unofficial magazine. So a lot of work about collecting, not only writing yourself, but also editing other people's work and encouraging others to write. So there was a bit of element of that as well. And that was, in my memory, it was one of the most fun highlights of my college life. So there was a bit of attraction to writing at that point. And soon after I left, I think that was when the blogging culture had reached us, which is when I set up my first blog. And then I wrote probably 100 posts in 10 years. It was that intermittent, itna ruk ruk ke kabhi kabhi, kuch idea aaya toh likha aur when I've traveled or I've seen something, sounds like my newsletter now, you're being very productive other than that, right? Creatively, I was doing nothing else. I was just doing my padhai, likhai, job, bob, yahi sab. So there was not, I mean, I used to feel like when the inspiration strikes, I'm able to get up and write. And sometimes in the middle of the night, an idea will come and I'll get up and write and go back to sleep and it'll be excellent. At least from that lens, today, I see them in cringe, but at that time, it used to be like aacha likha hai. But it was very, very few and far between, those writing forays. And then it was never a thing ke haan mujhe writer banna hai, like you had probably, ke main naukri chod ke writing karungi, aisa nahi tha kabhi. Very, like I said, wo middle class work aatha kehna hai, ki naukri toh chahiye, salary toh aani chahiye. But haan, yeh ek cheez hai jo mujhe, which gives me true joy. I mean, it's just like unadulterated joy. I'm getting nothing else out of this. But I like writing. I like it when other people like my writing and when people find it funny or people say they, it moved them or it taught them something that they, made them think in a way that they hadn't thought before. And then in parallel, I was having this whole gender evolution also, right, like coming to those realizations that kuch toh galat hai, bohot kuch galat hai, sab kuch galat hai. So that, that was happening separately. But then at some point, I think the two got combined and then, then womaning is what happened"

I did this class before yours, a course in which somebody said that writer is the one profession to which most of the people that claim they belong to that profession don't actually practice it, right. Many people will say I'm a writer, but they don't actually do the verb of writing. And that's where the entire secret of good writing or any writing is that you have to sit, park your Tashrif in a chair and do it. Because I was, I mean, basically, I was not doing it.

We would do a lot of, like I said, travel to districts and all. And a couple of us had gone out to various parts of the country and we had converged back in Delhi to report our findings and all. And so we were all having lunch and informal conversation was happening, kya kya dekha, kaha rahe, kaisa raha, yeh wo. And then I had said, I think at that point, that I was put up in, it was a small town and I was put up in a hotel room where, you know, there is an auto lock in the door. So it's not a kundi. It's a lock that just with the, you turn a knob and that's a lock. Basically that means it's a lock that can also be opened from outside. The kundi is the only thing, the latch is the only thing that is a hardware between you and a person outside who has the master key. So I said, I was, I was a bit terrified because the hotel was not the most unshady ones out there and the staff was, I was a little concerned for safety. And so raat ko main, I, maybe I overreacted, but main raat ko table, ek furniture, der darwaza ki against laga ke soyi, ke agar koi room mein ghusega toh at least I'll wake up with the noise, like that. And I thought that I was like, you know, I've said before that women think that these experiences are unique to us. And I thought I was the only paranoid person out there doing such a thing. But then there was another woman at that lunch table and who said, arey yeh same thing happened with me also. I also do this. Often I go to, whenever I'm traveling to these chota, small town mein chota hotel where safety is not a big guarantee, I also do this, mujhe bhi kundi pasand, agar kundi na ho toh I am also stressed the entire night, I can't sleep and sometimes I put furniture, sometimes I just don't sleep and things like that. And then ek ek karke two three women said, oh me too, me too. And then there was this one guy who was there and he was like, did you guys like plan this beforehand? Is this a prank on me? Because what are you all even talking about? I can't relate at all to this. If never, this thought has never crossed my mind. For me, somehow that moment was a, I mean, obviously there's history behind it. But that is when the coin dropped in my mind. Is the expression coin dropped or what? Pin dropped?"

We are sometimes husband and wife cohabiting and father, daughter, brother, sister living together in the same house, having such starkly different life experiences or colleagues working in the same office. Having itna different experiences that women are seeing a whole different side of the world that men are just not seeing. And even the most well-intentioned men out there who are like, oh women, full support, feminist, even those men are often just unaware of it. It's by no fault of their own. They've not had that experience and they're unaware. So, for me, that was a bulb moment that I felt ki ispe likhna chahiye. I should just talk to women and get these stories about things that women experience and it's very common between us and which men probably haven't thought of. And so, for me, because I had thought about feminism and I mean, I don't like to use that word because that word now means different things to different people and many people are all actually aligned to the thought of it, but just don't like the word because they interpret it differently. But either way, I had thought about writing about gender a lot and I used to think, you know, people write either about data, which is not my forte, I'm not a data scientist and I'm not the most knowledgeable person on that front. Some people write opinion pieces, but opinion mein yahi ho jata hai ki yeh toh is ladki ko opinion hai. I disagree. Baat wahi khatam. So, that's why for me, it was that ek toh meri apni writing mein, I feel like I'm more of a storyteller than a very concrete opinion writer and otherwise also, I find that stories are much more powerful. So, there was this documentary, it's on Netflix, Inside Bill's Brain, about Bill Gates. Usmein, there's one of the, there are these four episodes, I think, usmein se ek episode mein Bill Gates and Melinda, now Melinda French Gates, they're together talking about an issue. I think it was malaria in African kids. I'd forget the exact issue, but basically what they were saying was that Bill Gates would see data, k so many thousands of children losing their lives to malaria or diarrhea or whatever it was, and he would get moved by the data. But Melinda would say, said that for me, the numbers weren't so real until I traveled to Africa and I've met one mother who had lost one child. And for me, that moved me so much that it ultimately led to the setup of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So, for me, that was another Chamko bulb, light bulb moment because I felt like stories have so much more power than data, even though objectively thousands of children dying is worse than one child. But for a human being, for most of us, stories are what move us much more than data does. And so that was the, I decided at that point, it suddenly became quite clear to me the kind of writing I'll do, the way I will build these stories and these arguments, how I'll pick a theme about a subject that's not obvious to men, but is a lived experience of a majority of women. And then I'll interview women and real women's real stories I'll write. And that's how I will build that argument. It was not my personal opinion. This is the lived experience of these many women, which by the way, if now you talk to the woman sitting next to you, maybe she'll also concur. So that I felt might move the needle, at least when it came to individual opinions."

        "message": "Yeah, and the importance of storytelling is, you know, really, it's a difference that I keep talking about, you know, even in my writing class, or even generally, it's a difference between the abstract and the concrete. So you know, in Bill Gates's case, or in anybody's case, large numbers are abstract, you know, whereas actually a particular story of a particular person is concrete. And that has a far greater impact, your mirror neurons line up, as it were, in your head and much better chance of sort of empathy and kind of relating. And you know, what do you speak about the kundi? And you know, kundi not being there, I remember the first person who mentioned this to me was I'd done an episode on Me Too around the time Me Too happened with Supriya Nair and Nikita Saxena. And Nikita, of course, was a caravan journalist who would go around the country everywhere. And she pointed this out that men just completely sort of take it for granted. It's not something they would even look for. But for every woman, it's a real thing. It's part of that layer, that added layer of concern that women carry around with them, which men simply don't see, like I can go for a walk at midnight, or I can enter a crowded lift without having to look around or I can, you know, check into a hotel without caring about whether the kundi is there. But women carried these layers. In fact, when I was going through your posts, I was kind of putting them in different kinds of categories. And one of those categories was what only women go through, you know, and these are all things that are part of this layer, you know. So in a post where you actually wrote about this kundi incident, you also quoted someone called Natasha, who wrote, quote, every time I enter any public space, I look at the escape routes. I first look at what in the environment I can use as a weapon in case I'm attacked. I'm mentally prepared all the time. I have told this to male friends, and men just don't understand it. But in our heads, we women are constantly plotting how we can use a metal water bottle we are carrying for self-defense, like Shruti did reference to someone else, we are mentally practicing how to use it in case we get attacked. Stop quote. And the thing is, I think if you're a man and listening to this, and you think, oh, these are just some women to whom bad things have happened. They're really not. It's every woman, you know, that you have to learn to think about things in a way that men simply don't. And this percolates along other fault lines, you know, it's there in caste as well. You know, if somebody asked me what my surname is, after I say, Hi, I'm Amit, I don't even think twice about it. You know, for someone who is, you know, not of the same caste, there is that added layer of hostility and weariness that kind of that you sense from the other person. So it's interesting just to, you know, think of the kind of life we live in India, think of all the different fault lines, and all the different layers that are therefore invisible to us. And then get back to your narrative, you know, you've thought that you want to tell the stories of women to kind of make all of these connections, but you're thinking of it at that point as"

        "message": "a book. So this idea was probably I carried around for two years, or maybe three years, because soon after this idea came to me, I was pregnant with this idea and then pregnant with an actual child. So that that kind of took over. And then we had our baby and then COVID happened around the same time. And then some, I mean, this idea was constantly with me, I would often go back and think about it. But I was thinking about it like a book. And as I mean, I'm no imposter syndrome here, genuinely, I'm a very undisciplined person, because I need a deadline or something to work towards, otherwise, I don't, I don't of my own volition will not sit down to do something without an answerability or a deadline just programmed that way by our education system. So for that reason, I think I never wrote a word about it. I mean, I would talk to women and I would note down their stories on my phone in an app evernote, I would write them sometimes on on the laptop and paste them there. And then, but I had these disparate collection of stories over several months and years of talking to women, but I hadn't actually sat sit down to, you know, start writing the book. And then around somewhere, I think in September cohort, I was in in your course. And so the the course was great, of course, but at the end of the course, I think the conversation that I you and I had was for me the big, well, decisive moment. After the course ended, I told you that, you know, I have this book idea and can we discuss it and then we had a zoom call and I told you the idea. And I also had a lot of concerns, I remember at that time about writing it as a privileged woman, because, you know, what if people say that you're, if I don't write about women who are suffering from many other and much more devastating challenges like poverty and caste and all of that, if I don't write about them, then this is a first world woman problem. If I write about them, then people say you're appropriating, you don't know what you're writing about, which I truly don't. I've had all of these concerns and questions in my mind. And I remember that conversation with you was very clarifying for me, because you said, you know, you write what you think about what you know about and what you feel happy, confident writing and don't worry about all of this criticism. I'd imagined too many layers of criticism in my mind. So for me, it was quite freeing to let go of that, kya hoga toh hoga, dekhenge, but for now, let me just write what I feel strongly about, like these things are my lived experiences. So at least that I can, that's where I can start. And it's not like there's a hierarchy of problems, right? Because you have a problem, which is a quote unquote first world problem, so it's not a problem anymore. Like if you are not able to sleep through the night, because you're worried about your safety in a place where you've paid good money to stay be and be safe, then that's a legitimate real problem. Even if you're not starving, and even if you're, you don't have any of the other multiple multitudes of problem that women, other women suffer from, it doesn't diminish that you are still facing a challenge that's unfair, and it's totally because of your gender. So that was freeing. And then you also, the biggest thing was that you said write it as a newsletter, which I had never considered up till that point. And then you said that, you know, because you're not, also not the challenge, I'd challenge of not having the self-discipline to write a chapter a day or a chapter a week, just put yourself, give yourself a weekly deadline, ke har hafte ek post nikalna hai. And then I was like, ki yaar weekly karein, ki fortnightly karein, ho payega, ki nahin ho payega. And then, but then you said that, you know, you will, before you realize it, you'll have a body of work behind you. And then somebody who discovers you two years down the line can actually go back and click into the stuff you've written along the way. And that in itself is a, is an achievement to have that body of work. And then later, if you want to make it a book. So for me, that was a tipping point where I said, and I think even after, uske bhi do teen mahine baad jaake, like today, if anyone goes and sees my first welcome post, it begins, the publishing date is October 3rd or something. But it came out in December. It came out in December. So the first thing I written is that there is a two month gap in the date on this piece and the actual publishing of this piece, because I put it out and then I didn't put it out there. I mean, I published it very locally as a private thing. That's why the publishing date is two months behind. So it took me two months to kind of, you know, gather the courage to do it and feel like kya theek hai, there's something I could pull off. And so on my birthday, 4th December in 2020, was when I kind of went public with it, ki theek hai, ab main likh rahi hoon, dekha jayega. And then I got like 100 subscribers on day one, and I was very shocked ki yaar, damn people have actual faith in me now, I had better turn up the next Friday. At that time, I used to publish on Fridays, now I publish Mondays. But so that's where it started. And now I have a weekly deadline to work towards, so there's really no getting around it. I do have to write, which is thanks to you, I have actually built up a significant body"

No, it's a it's an impressive body of work and really impresses me is that even though you took that couple of months to get down to it, once you got down to it, you were so regular, you know, clockwork pe aata tha, ki iska toh aana hi hai, whatever day you decided you changed that later, but iska toh aana hi hai, which was impressive to me, because it wasn't just someone sitting down and writing their own thoughts, a lot of work went into it in terms of research in terms of speaking to people and all of that. Tell me a little bit about your work ethic during this period and how you manage this. Like this is author called Mason Curry, who'd once come out with a book called Daily Rituals, where he spoke to writers about their work habits and their work ethics and all that. And he was criticized correctly that boss, it's all men, you know, men ke liye toh alag hai, men toh apna sab kar sakte hai and you know, there'll be clockwork creatures in the background providing them the food and providing them everything and kind of taking care of all that. What about women? And then Curry to his credit came out with a book called I think Women Artists at Work or whatever, I'll kind of put that up. So I'm curious about how you then manage to get all the writing done, given that at the same time, there is baby, there is house, there is family, there is, you know, everything else is kind of also happening. How do you then find that mind space, find the discipline? So what were the methods that you kind of what were those early weeks like when you were kind of finding a groove just where you can write and you can bring it out on time?"

        "message": "Yeah. So like I said, I had these disparate stories collected in on a note taking app, which which were the first body that I tapped into, okay, let's look at three or four and figure out what is the most compelling one to me right now. And my first post was about maternity discrimination, because I was literally a new mother at that point. And I had just been talking to you, you know, when you become a mother, somebody, some kind of woman will add you to a mom's group, and that's where you will discuss all your problems, like breastfeeding, the kid has a rash, what to do, he has a fever, what to do, the kid is eating, not eating, sleeping, not sleeping, all your early new mother concerns, which there's always something going terribly wrong in your life that is making you question your worth as a human being. So that tapping into that group and community at that time can be a huge source of comfort and support. I don't know how moms did it before this technology was available. So that became my starting point, because we would talk there also about joining back work and how many moms would feel that, you know, I'm not getting the same position, the same kind of projects are not coming my way, or my organization has said, some people will let go also some women after becoming a mother that you can't keep up with those deadlines and all that. Like people would decide on your behalf, even if you are ready to put in the work to meet the deadlines and do the stressful work, which should not be imposed on people, but even if you volunteer to do it, people will decide on your behalf that you no longer can. So bye. So in India, there is no law against maternity discrimination, that was the first piece I wrote and that had only stories of two women. And I kind of tried the way of, if you read that postage, first her story, then another's, then another's, then another's, then another's, so they go in parallel and then later I talk about how their experiences were different yet similar and blah, blah, blah, the laws in US law in India. Then the second one was, I think about body shaming, which another issue very close to heart very personally felt. And then the moment I, that one I didn't have many backup of many stories, but I just asked a couple of friends and you talk to the first five women, you'll have five stories about body shaming. It's that universal among women. So it was, so Shuruma, it was my group of friends and my direct circle. But soon as womaning grew and as it became a little more popular among people, more subscribers, more readers, more on these moms groups, women are talking about it. Then I started getting also stories from women I didn't originally know. My process was, and this is the book that you've mentioned, I've read the book, the man's habit, the male artist's habit is, we'll wake up in the morning, then a breakfast, then a coffee, then a stroll by the lake, then in the evening we'll write for two hours, then after that drinks at the local pub, then this, then that, I mean, then walk, hiking on the mountain and inspiration from all this. And later you Google them, they have 14 kids, who's raising those 14 kids, right? So no one is talking about that in the successful habits of these successful men. So there are, and then when you actually read up, there are, some of these men were beasts, they were monsters. The kind of things they did to their wives, to their partners, the kind of privileges they had, like, they want this type of food at this time and food is being presented in front of them. And she's raising kids, she's managing the household and you'll say no, no support stuff because kids should get the love of their mother, all beastly things these men have done. And we celebrate so many of them today. And you go back and you read about them. So this was Leo Tolstoy, who I started, who I discovered accidentally on the internet while I was writing a piece on breastfeeding. And a book had come out recently about his, someone had found an account of his wife, Sophia Tolstoy, and her diary or something had been made public. And in that, I read about how he had these 13-14 kids, and he used to force her to breastfeed all the children. And at one time, she was suffering from some postpartum issue because of which she was not able to. And then they'll breastfeed each other's children also because they're all at the same age. And it was an accepted done thing. So I think at that time, there was a driver's wife or some domestic help they had who also had a baby the same age. And so, Sophia Tolstoy wanted to ask that, request that woman to breastfeed the baby. And Leo Tolstoy said, no, you will not do it and you have to do it yourself. And then ultimately, I think that lady ended up feeding their child and he wrote a very cruel play about his wife mocking her and called his son as the outcast or orphan or something was raised by somebody else like there was a lot of toxicity there."

So in between all that, it was, and I had a job. I used to work with the World Bank at the time. Luckily, my boss was in the US, so I used to work at night. So I had actually engineered it that way, at least for the day, I'm free for caregiving and at night I'll do a few hours of the work and then after that, I'll do these quick calls and by the way, many women I'm interviewing are also mothers. So they are just as busy as I am. So it was always a huge scheduling challenge. So actually, not a very small percentage, but a limited percentage of the stories I've written about have actually been phone conversations that I've even had with them and milna to kher possible hi nahi tha during the pandemic, but even conversations have been very few. Most of them have been either chats or I've asked them to send me voice notes with, I send them questions and later they send voice notes as answers because I can't even expect a mother to type out an answer and send me. So women are busy on both sides of that relationship, the person who's interviewing and the interviewer. So that was how I would pull together these stories. I would decide on a theme for the week and publicly put out a call for stories that were harder to find. Like when I wrote about domestic violence and all, there's not a lot of women who will come out on a WhatsApp group with 200 other women and say, hi, I was abused. So there I would put out a call on Twitter or something so that people can privately reach out to me. But some of these like imposter syndrome, the kundi thing, these things women are quite comfortable discussing in the open and you know, nobody really, like you said, men take them for granted. Right? And men don't even listen to these stories. So women are actually, when you are approaching it with good faith and they trust you, they are quite open and I feel like women's conversations are far richer than men's conversation. Men will usually gather and even with their father and brother and best friend, they'll talk about sports and politics and banal stuff, which has no consequence really to your life immediately. But men often have very, I find, surface conversations, which is a pity because women's conversations are really rich and really, I mean, they open up and they trust and they share quite freely."

And I kind of feel that there is something there that in many of these episodes where I've just sat and spoken to a woman for five hours, there is, you know, these people have left the filter, just spoken with such raw honesty, and gone really deep and all of that. And I'm trying to figure out why this is because what you say about conversations is also, of course, quite true. Most of the time, you know, men are kind of are talking about sports and whatever and all of that, like you pointed out, the conversations can stay shallow. And I'm just thinking aloud here, but I'd love to sort of ask you to sort of elaborate not just on the what of it, but also the why of it. Why do you think that happens? Do you think that one thing that constrains that kind of deep conversation between men is sort of this fear of intimacy, you know, that macho thing that you know, you will never show your emotion, you will never show your vulnerability. And I think part of any honest conversation between two people is when you let that guard down and you're willing to show your vulnerability and you're willing to show when you're moved by something or when you don't know something, or you're feeling lost and confused, and you're willing to express that and men don't do that enough. So I'm just thinking aloud that maybe that's one possible reason, but if you had to look at the why of it, what would you sort of?"

        "message": "Yeah, so it's a bit on both sides. And like I always say, you know, gender issues are not a men versus women issue. They are actually all of us are affected by them. You're rightly saying that. I think men are conditioned from an early age to, you know, hide their emotions, boys don't cry, and those things. So they're taught that it is weakness to show vulnerability, it is weakness to show and to accept your flaws or to discuss your failings. And so there is this burden, unnecessary burden in the modern age, which is put on men of \u2013 men are no longer sole breadwinners in most families, in this strata at least. And yet they have this burden of, I have to be the stoic supporter and carry this burden all by myself. They don't have to really. We can all be human beings with each other at this point, at least in families where there's otherwise financially secure, security is there, both are equal partners in terms of who's bringing in the dough and things like that. Even in relationships where the wife is a stay-at-home wife or mother. Even in those relationships, I'm saying that there is equal vulnerability that can be shown by both partners. It's not necessary anymore, but we are still somehow teaching our boys those problematic values and forcing them to hold up themselves to this unreal standard. So that's definitely a problem that affects men. And then I think on the women's side, there is a lot of feeling of not being heard enough in your own marriages, in your own homes, by your own family. So that also leads to women opening up more easily when they are given the chance. Because we are taught, we are silenced right from an early age. Like I said, you know, like, achi ladkiya zor se nahi hasti, achi ladkiya zyada nahi bolti. So these things are taught to us from a very early stage. And so we have bottled up a lot. And there is obviously much more disadvantage and discrimination that we are facing. And we have nowhere to voice it, at least not in our immediate relationships in most cases. So that's another reason why women kind of open up quite freely and with each other. And that is not new even, you know, I mean, even in I think my grandmom's generation, I have known aunts and all having this delicious conversation, which you would just want to be a fly on the wall and drink it all up ki achha yeh bhi hota tha family mein humein yeh pata hi nahi tha, like stuff like that. And men are talking about OLD and, sorry, what was it, ODL and all those things. So there, that's what it's, it's that difference has been there forever of women's conversation being more rich. And it's a, it's a issue, I think, on both sides."

My brother is probably the funniest person I know. So there was always humor as a coping mechanism, as a defense mechanism, there is a lot of humor in the family, in my personality. Probably not the most world-class jokes, but it is. Yaar tum kaise yeh phir, humor me bhi imposter syndrome. I know, it's terrible. So much unlearning needed. Anyway, so humor has always been a big part of my life. So for me, that was also important. I like it when people say that, you know, your writing made me laugh or even chuckle or even smile. And these are, like we've discussed, these are difficult topics, sometimes heavy topics. And I also want my audience to keep wanting to come back and, you know, I've myself read so many writings about gender which make you feel depressed and make you feel sad and hopeless about life and you don't want to go back there. There are serious issues and people have tackled them in serious voices. And as a person with a taste that prefers lightness and prefers entertainment, for me, I have not been able to watch a certain movie, for example, if it's very serious and very stark in your face, horrible realities of life, dekho kitna dard, toh wo mere se nahi hota as a consumer. I am not able to consume that and I find it that it disturbs my mental balance, sanity and everything. So I didn't want to inflict that on my readers, even though I'm talking about difficult subjects. So that was a definite choice there that it has to be funny, but again, with the right balance of somehow in a way that doesn't trivialize it. And then Bollywood, like I said, I'm a fan. It's been a part of a constant backdrop to my life growing up. So that is what came naturally to me. And everyone says that, I think you also said that in your writing course, that don't look for the thing that you'll be the first person to write, that duniya mein kisi ne is baare mein aaj tak lika, I'll be the one who'll introduce this to humanity. Aisa wait karoge toh you'll never find a chapter, any subject to write about because everything has been touched upon by someone or the other. But you are the only you in the world. So your experiences, your lived experiences, your personality is what you bring to it. So for me, it was also a conscious choice that I should write in a way that I talk to a friend. I should write in the way that I normally would interact with people. That's bringing my personality to it. And so this was the most entertaining way that I could come up with. And it does evolve with time. Sometimes there are very serious topics which I just cannot at all introduce any humor in. Like I've written about domestic violence, miscarriages, abortions, these are not subjects in which you can bring in Bollywood gifs. But for the most part, other subjects, which are a part of everyday life, there is a lot of satire, sarcasm, gifs, memes, and people have appreciated a lot. Like my readers, when they write back to me, they say that, you know, I love the way you highlight these things and I want to, and it makes me want to keep coming back for more. And that's basically mission accomplished, right? That a person did not feel turned off by the gruesome realities of life and wants to actually read more about it. And sort of like the, that's what this is."

And, you know, I figured that to you, they might seem hey, you know, normal and the stuff of everyday life and what's the big deal about it, but I just feel it all bears talking about because what they have in common is that it is both something that is in front of us and yet we do not see it. So for that reason alone, but before we go there, one sort of final meta question in terms of how has the response to womaning in India been from people? How has the response been from women? And I would imagine there are two kinds of responses from men. So, you know, tell me a little bit about these responses and, you know, how they've come your way, what they've meant to you."

        "message": "Okay. So I think we discussed this yesterday when we were talking about what we'll talk about. And I said that there's a whole unseen part of womaning that we should talk about, which is what is not published out there, what happens after I put out a piece. And it's always like my favorite time is right after I've put a piece out because that's when the responses start coming in and somebody will write a long email back to me. Somebody will send me a WhatsApp message. Somebody will write, retweet on Twitter with a comment of their own. And often, sometimes it's even happened that, you know, I put out a piece with five stories and then the most stark story has come back as feedback to me that, oh, you know, this happened to me too. And by the way, here's what happened. And I was like, my God, this is the story which should have been the centerpiece of what I wrote. And so I love the feedback I get because it's often very personal. It's not just that thumbs up, it's not just that, it's very, very personal. It's that, you know, this happened to me in my life. My mother-in-law said this, my father said that, my boss said this, my colleague did that. And people, especially women, will connect with real examples from their life. And you mentioned men have two types of responses. Actually, men have one type of response and women have two. That was a surprise for me as well. So men will, the one response I get is appreciation from men because the rest of the men will ignore it. It's very easy to ignore things, right, when you are living in a privileged life. Like we spoke about caste. Now I used to really pride myself for a long part of my life that I don't even know what caste I belong to. Such a matter of pride. So I am such an un-castist, but then later I realized that it's a privilege that is available only to upper caste people that, or forward caste people that you don't know what caste you are. If you are from a backward caste, you will be made aware of your caste by the world, right. So just the fact that you don't know what caste you are defines, shows what caste you are and it's a privilege. And there's so much happening around me at all times, which has to do with caste, which I don't even see because my privilege has made my life a smooth highway, why should I think about the ubad khabad rast on the side, right. And that's how I also think about what it must be like for men. So even, like I said, the most well-meaning men, their life is so comfortable with all these privileges that they don't even know they have, that there, what is the incentive? Why should they worry about other people living a more difficult life? Of course, yes, one incentive is that these other people are your own wife, your own mother, your daughter, our mothers and sisters. But other than that, if you just think about it as the comfort of privilege, it happens to all of us and we are all guilty of it, all of us who have our privilege on one axis or the other. So men will either ignore or because they are too privileged and why should they care about a woman writer or the ones who read are genuinely, they send me things like, you know, this is an education, I look forward to it every week, every week you make me aware of something that I never thought about, and they've been super supportive. There's a friend who is a CEO running his own firm now, and he read the post I wrote about lack of women friendly infrastructure in workplaces. And he said, I'm installing sanitary pad vending machines in my office toilet. As soon as I finished reading this post, I was like, I'm doing this right now. So you know, I've had such tangible impact from my readers and male readers have been nothing but kind because those who are unkind will not read. Women on the other hand have had a polar opposite response. So one is, of course, a vast majority of women who support it, who love it, who say that, you know, it felt like you were speaking my words, this is what I always wanted to say, it was like reading my own inner voice. And I'm so happy you gave voice to this particular thing, because this really bothered me and like I said, a lot of personal stories and very rich love that I get from them. And then there are women who are offended, like violently offended by it. I've had women shout at me on the phone, that tum kar kya rahe ho, tum kya likhna chahate ho, kya kar rahi ho tum, you are corrupting the minds of people. And I've had women like shout at me and I've had visceral violent responses to womaning. And I've always wondered that, you know, going in even I thought like you said just now that men might hate it, but most women will like it. And then when I thought about it deeper, I thought, you know, these are often women who have lived for years and decades in that restricted lifestyle and in that prison of gender roles, ki main aurat ho mera kaam hai, Diwali ke din khade hoke sab ke liye pakode dalna or whatever. The XYZ gender role has been a part of their identity for so many decades and they've lived it for so many decades that now if you question it, it makes them feel like I lived my life wrong or I could have lived it better or, you know, this piece of writing is highlighting something that has gone terribly wrong with my life and I don't want to pull on that thread. So that's why women often have a very visceral response. So my strongest, harshest critics have been women, not men."

        "message": "No, so the cold hatred comes from via email or something. Sometimes angry mails will come. But ye phone call wala shouting happened because I was actually talking to a lady about some other story and then she said she was in her late 50s or 60s, early 60s. And she said that, you know, one issue that nobody talks about is late age care and how women are made responsible for caregiving for their in-laws, but not their parents. So at a very senior age, when a person is bedridden, has to be cleaned, has to be bathed, you have to do like very, very intimate care for that person. At that age, it will not be the son who will be asked to do that, it will be the daughter-in-law. Even though, if you think about it, our parents have cleaned our poop when we were kids, we should be the ones doing it for them when we grow up. But no, the men will not be asked to do it, their wives will be asked to do it. And conversely, the wives are not often allowed to do it for their own parents, because wahan ki bahu karegi wo kaam. Right, so this was a subject I hadn't thought of because stage of life, I have not reached that stage of life where you're caregiving for your parents. But I was like, oh wow, this is insightful, I've never thought of this, but I don't have enough friends in that age group either who are at that stage of life. So can you introduce me to some people who, some more women who will tell me more stories about this and I'll build a piece around it. So then she gave me numbers of some women and she said so and so is doing for her in-law, so and so has her own mother is in an old age home, but she's doing it for her father-in-law, something like that. So she gave me a couple of numbers and one of the numbers I called and that lady thought that somehow there was a miscommunication. She thought I'm calling to write a very positive story about what a great daughter-in-law she is. But when I asked her, I said, do you not feel ki aapko apni mother ko caregiving karne ka bhi haq hai, ya should your husband be the one contributing towards caregiving for your in-laws, at least contributing, if not doing it himself. There's no shame in caring for your parents-in-law, but why only one gender? So then I think the line of questioning was something I assumed she was expecting because there was an interlocutor between us who had told me that this person is at the same stage of life. But I suppose there was a miscommunication. So she did not at all agree with the point of view that I was coming to it with. So she was like, you have an agenda against women and against culture and society and so she scolded me a lot on the phone, so I said, sorry ma'am, you had a miscommunication, it's okay, I'm sorry, I hurt your feelings, I think we'll drop it here. Then I cut the call and then she sent me a lot of abuses on WhatsApp and a lot of other things. I mean, see, that's what I'm talking about, you don't, there are threads that people don't want you to pull at in their life. It's like the boss who got upset with me because I quit the service because he's in the service, right? So that is a criticism. It's a statement I'm making on his life choices."

The argument basically being that you should not do something to people without their consent and it is wrong to cause people pain or to kill them. And basically, when you're having kids, you are guaranteeing that they will feel pain and they will die and there is no way of taking their consent and therefore it's wrong. So that was my provocative argument. And I've never got trolled by anyone like I've been trolled by the right, I've been trolled by the left, I've been trolled by Shahrukh Khan fans, I've been trolled on religious grounds.

You mentioned that the way that you prefer to think about them is what women go through in offices, what women go through in public spaces, what women go through at home.

        "message": "what their role typically becomes within offices? Yeah. So what kind of jobs women have, we have the same kind of jobs that men do, right? But there is a well documented phenomena called the brilliance bias, which is that when I ask you to think of 10 brilliant people, you will probably name 9 men. And most people will name 10 men. Because we think that brilliance is a very male trait. And for reasons that we've discussed before, like nobody knows the name of Einstein's wife. She's as brilliant as he was. But brilliance bias, we think that Einstein is the, history has also taught us that Einstein was, the history is paved by great big men, right? So therefore, there is an assumption when a man does a job that he is competent to do that job, fair or unfair. And there is, but when a woman is in the same position, and has come to it through the same channel, by the way, having overcome many hurdles, which are unseen, she's constantly expected to prove her competence to do that job. So this happens, especially in STEM, where brilliance bias is the most in science, technology engineering, mathematics, where it's a male dominated field. And over and over women are asked, can you do this? Are you able to do this? I've spoken to women who are senior data scientists in big companies, Google and all and who've had youngsters come up to them and explain what is HTTP. Young men will come and say like, aapko toh bata nahi hoga, main bata deta ho, like that. So it's not even, it's a cross hierarchy, like it's not even that you will respect a person because they're more senior to you. Because she's a woman, you'll assume that she doesn't know what she's doing, or she's here because of some other reasons, not because of her competence. So that's a pain point that women have, in many different aspects of their jobs, reiterated that it's assumed that I don't know how to do my job. And this plays out in many ways. So one very interesting thing that a woman told me, which I'm yet to write about is failure, the permission to fail. Men have the permission to fail over and over again, and will be given many more chances to fail than a woman. If as a woman you fail once, immediately you'll be labeled ke, because iska bacha isliye ye fail hui, because iski shaadi hone waliye isliye ye fail hui, because she's single isliye ye fail hui, koi bhi cheez ho jayegi. And somehow it'll be, that failure will become your, will be associated with you for life. So women don't have that much scope to fail. Women also don't have access to mentors at work for this reason, because either male mentors are creepy themselves, or there is an assumption that there's something creepy going on between a male mentor and female mentee. Even if it's completely harmless between them, people will perceive it in a very different way than that relationship between two men. What you spoke about, what kind of jobs they end up doing. So that's a post I wrote about, are you the office mom? So this has happened to me, it has happened to many women, that lunch ka time hai to, arey, Mahima ko do na menu, she will order. Women are better at this, or, achha, so and so, wo hai, kuch organize karna hai, get together, ya outing, chalo, Mahima aap karo na, ladies are better at this creative stuff, aap log creative hote ho. So it'll be wrapped up in a compliment, but it is ultimately that this is not a job good enough for us to do. So you be the office mom. And so women are often taking notes at meetings, women will be the one running a PPT, down down down button press karne ka gaam maine bhi bahut ki hai, PMO ba jaa ke bhi ki hai, Prime Minister exam le bhi peeche baith ke down button press ki hai. So like, this is often the task for which women are chosen, we make good secretaries according to, and you can be at any level of seniority or professional achievement, these tasks will come to women. Another is being heard in meetings. So another thing that has also personally happened to me, and I've written a post about it, that people, and not just men, people suffer from selective deafness. So the chair of a meeting, whether it is a man or a woman, will give more weightage and attention to a man speaking than he or she does to a woman speaking. So it's happened to me that I've been talking and somebody will interrupt me suddenly and talk over me and the entire room's attention shifts to that person very seamlessly as if I, and makes me question, was I even talking, did I imagine that I was talking. People have repeated what I've said, sometimes with a little creativity and they are given credit for the idea that I had proposed. I had a colleague to whom I actually had a conversation with, he was a nice guy, but he used to interrupt me a lot and talk over me. So because he was a nice guy, I thought, let me try having a rational conversation. So outside the meeting room, once I told him that, listen, you know, you do this. And he was like, no, I don't do this, what are you talking about, very full denial. And then next time I was talking in a meeting and he did this. And then I just looked at him and I gave him a smile. And the horror that descended on his face, because then he realized that, oh my God, I was actually doing this to her. And people are doing it unconsciously, like by now we are conditioned to tune out a female sound meter, that there is some nonsense going on with the female pitch, there is something important going on with the male pitch. This is programmed in us, we are conditioned to accept this, both men and women. So it's all these ways in which it plays out, these biases about women's incompetence."

Such men are called driven and focused and go getters. But I personally experienced what happens when a woman tries the same. You are either too meek or too aggressive. I don't know any woman who has managed to hit that mythical sweet spot between the two. Stop quote. And later on in your post about selective deafness in meetings, you know, you give the moral of the story as, quote, a woman who is quiet is incompetent. A woman who speaks up is a fearsome terror. There is no middle ground available. Stop quote. And you also quoted someone called Pallavi, who is giving her suggestion for how to deal with this. And her suggestion is that whenever you have a suggestion, frame it as a question. So she says, quote, I started phrasing my opinions as questions to get heard. I would intentionally sound stupid to make my point. For example, if I found a big gap in their balance sheet or profit and loss statement, instead of saying that is wrong, I would say, why do we put it that way? And in the process of answering my stupid question, they would realize their mistake and figure out what they needed to do to correct it. Six months of this led to them making enormous changes, putting me in charge of reviews and making sure I was part of every boardroom meeting. Stop quote. And at least she got her due in terms of, you know, her critical thinking recognized and being part of every boardroom meeting. But in general, you know, we've spoken about that added layer, which comes in when women are experiencing the world. But is there also an added layer, which women have to use when they are deciding how to interact with the world? For example, if I am saying something to anybody in a meeting or with a friend or whatever, I won't have to think about how will this go down? How will I be perceived? Will I be perceived as too forward or too demanding or whatever? I don't need to think like that, I'll just say it. Is that a layer also that women always have with them that you have to actually think about how your words will be perceived, not just what you are saying?"

So when this penny drop for me was a moment when I suddenly realized that me and I had a male colleague, we were used to work at the same level. And I realized the kind of emails we write are so different, like, so suppose you are my colleague, and you have to say a meeting is postponed, you will write, dear so and so this meeting is postponed to 5.30pm, best Amit. That's the kind of email that my colleague used to write, I would write, dear sir, due to some unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances and technical issues we are facing, I apologize that this meeting has been postponed. It is now going to be scheduled at this time. I will keep you updated if there's a change. I apologize once again for the inconvenience. Warm regards, I always use warm because you have to, just regards also, rude, warm regards.

And I would see his messages and I'd be like, dear, if I write such an email, I'll become famous within one week that this person writes rude emails. And this again has been shown, social experiments have been done. There have been people, I think there was an experiment where a woman wrote some emails as a man or a man wrote emails as a woman and they were perceived very differently and they were shocked by how a person who's perceived to be a woman, people take offense much quicker and will try to talk down to them, explain simple things to them like they're dumb. And when you perceive it's a man, suddenly the respect goes up.

        "message": "Tell me also about physical spaces, because to me, one of the best metaphors for how we live in a world designed by men for men is air conditioning. And you've also written a post about it. I'd written about it three or four years ago, I think when Me Too happened. You know how air conditioning was designed in the 1950s and 60s, when all offices were occupied mostly by men. And so it kept the male body temperature into account and that too, assuming that men are wearing suits or 21 degrees was like the default. Now, the truth is that it's too cold for women. Women feel cold at 21. You know, they need something warmer. And yet the default is that, you know, every office today will be too cold for women because it's set at that, quote unquote, male temperature. And therefore, one thing that you point out is very common for women to have is that they'll have something called an office sweater, office sweater, office shawl, because they know that there's no way out. They've got to kind of deal with that. And you've also pointed out that this is also true when it comes to having women's toilets and not just to say in Bihar, where you know, where you point out this particular place where there were seven women in an office of 300. But even in Kerala, where there were 100 women out of a staff of 300. And even there, there's one lady's toilet as compared to eight or 10 ladies toilets. And you've also pointed out this another example, which another of the people who spoke to you gave that she was in this place where, you know, there were enough women, but there were only two toilets on the floor. It was an office in a five star hotel and they were both gents toilets. So she spoke to her boss and her boss said, okay, it's fair enough, ladies do it. And one people spread a rumour that she was having an affair with the boss, because why else would he agree to this? And two, these guys would slink in after office hours, and they would pee all over the women's toilet because they were just so angry. And so these are really two separate questions. And one is that just in terms of workplaces, do you see a growing awareness or are women just saying that this is not a fight worth fighting, we'll just satisfy sweet, you know, in your post on pregnancy, you wrote about, you know, to punish a woman for being pregnant, she was actually put on a floor because they want to make life uncomfortable for her because she leaves. So, in workplaces, do you see the general attitude of the women being that we'll manage, you know, and you carry that layer where whenever you enter a place, you're quickly eyeing out where is the nearest toilet when you need it? And that's one question, and the second one is, what is with this male anger? You know, that story, I found it so disturbing, that people are going after office hours, and they're peeing all over the women's toilet because they're upset that women have a toilet."

        "message": "So yeah, 100%. So first part is about women. How do they cope? I think most women suffer in silence. That is the majority reaction. Very few women are like me who will make a nuisance of themselves and the lady in my story who went and told, at least had the guts to go and talk to the boss about it. So first of all, most senior professionals are male, glass ceiling. So upar se koi soch hi nahi raha hain issues ki baare mein because they are men. They are incapable of thinking about these things because who has the time to apna profit loss yeh sab cheeze sochna hai, market share sochna hai, sab ke beech mein who's going to sit and think about do my employees have enough women toilets and what are the facilities in these toilets. No one has time to think about it. So mostly the bosses are men and so they don't have even, it's a complete blind spot for them. And most women who are working at these lower level positions don't have the voice or the agency or the courage to talk about it, you know. The word toilet is not something that women will use very freely around men anyway because of all the cultural filters that we have. Like I am the only person here probably who's talking this much about toilet. You used the word tatti on my show which I think is a first. Thank you for that. It's a first, right? Yeah. So that's what. So I mean, this is very shocking for most people. So cultured society mein yeh baatein nahi hoti hain and therefore cultured society mein women are not able to voice these demands or expectations. And women are also in our own way conditioned to accept this as the lot of life, not question it. Hai to hai, jaana hai, upar to jaana hai toilet ke liye, door jaana hai to jaana hai, poori building mein 100 aartein par toilets 1 is to 10 ka ratio hai to, theek hai, karenge sab ussi mein adjust, line laga ke. This is how women, I think for the vast majority of women cope like this because often they are working at a junior level compared to men and culturally they have been trained to be quiet. So most women suffer in silence. Why is there anger in men? I think womaning would also make more men angry if it had a tangible impact on their life, right? So I don't think a newsletter passively sitting on the internet is really making any tangible difference to their life, but if it did, then they would be angry too. I know a friend of mine who's been an active supporter and she's, many of these stories, like all the names are changed by the way, the names you are taking are not the real names of the women. So you've already spoken one or two of her stories. So she has been an active supporter and she reads it regularly and she shows it to her husband also sometimes that yeh meri kahaani hai kabhi kabhi when it's a professional story, personal nahi batati hai. But so recently she was telling me that she was having a fight with her husband about some gender roles in the house that she was constantly caregiving for both children and she had a trip opportunity coming up and for foreign something travel and he said, no, you're not going. Who's going to take care of the kids and all? And they had like a serious fight about it. And at one point he said ki yeh sab tum yeh womaning pad ke seekh rahi ho na. So for me it was a matter of great pride that it is, a man is seeing this as something that empowered a woman enough to question the inhuman conditions he is enforcing on his wife. But also that is the only place where it had, as soon as it started having a real impact on his real life, that's when he got upset with it and violently upset with it. Anything that actually will take away some of your male privilege will hurt you. That is a point where, and again, people seeing this as a zero-sum game, right, like here it is a zero-sum game. There are only two toilets. Toh agar ek toilet ladies ban gaya, toh mera ek toilet kam ho gaya as a man. Toh I am angry, ke unko kyun de diye aur toh ko utha ke mera toilet. Toh therefore, not seeing it as a larger thing where women have been suffering for so many years, I am the one who was occupying their rightful toilet and now it's only going back to the person who it truly belonged to. That's not how they'll see it. They'll see it as, I've for the last five years been peeing in this toilet, suddenly who are you to tell me I can't anymore? So let me fling some feces at you."

        "message": "I love that line, unko kyun de diya mera toilet utha ke, which is quote of the episode. What you also kind of point out is how, and this is again something men will kind of miss or just take for granted, how there's a boys club in every office and it stops women from kind of getting ahead, like there was a 2020 Harvard study you've cited, which says, quote, over a four year period, male employees assigned a male manager were promoted faster than their female counterparts with no observable difference in performance. Women in turn were promoted at the same rate, whether assigned to a male manager or female manager, male employees benefited from the higher rates of social interactions with their male managers, stop quote. And this might mean, you know, after work, you're going out for a drink with your male colleagues, which women sometimes can't do, because hey, they got to get back home, there's food to cook, all that other stuff is happening, or they may not even want to, you know, it can just manifest in working late in office, where the woman will be like, the men will stay till nine, 10 o'clock. And you know, I think one of the people you spoke to commented on the actually the same amount of work is getting done, men are just stretching it out. It's like Parkinson's law, right? Work expands to fill the time available, you know. So I remember in my old office, there used to be a pool table, so we used to work late, we used to play pool all night, but it's like, you know, and that obviously leads to a bonding among all the people who are there and all that shit is happening. So how does one look at this? Because then what happens here, in a sense, is that all the men have the potential to form this closely knit community of people who are doing all of these things together. And all the women individually are kind of outside of this, right? How does that pervert workplaces? And how are there ways out of it? Because these are all individual choices, you know, I can well, you know, if you ask a guy, he'll say that, listen, I'll go out drinking with whoever I choose, right? You know, what can I do? No one is stopping her from coming. So these are all individual choices. And yet collectively, there's a massive problem for everybody. So you know, what are what are sort of your thoughts?"

So why shouldn't I capitalize on that? So I again, this is, you know, we talked about how earlier, you have a problem with government system, but not the people in that system. So same here, I have a problem with the system, not the men and women in it. Because like you said, these are individual choices that they are making based on their life conditions. And we can't say that toilets will be made when the caste system ends. So we can't say that first end gender discrimination, then we'll do something about the boys club. So we can't say that let the women first become equal partners to their husband and let their husbands take care of their children. So the woman can come here and have a drink with us as colleagues. That's not going to happen anytime soon. So I think the simpler solution, and that's why I started with workplaces because it has a little more simpler solutions, simpler problems to solve, this is on the boss basically. If you are taking important decisions about strategies and professional decisions are being made outside the office hours or the office space on a sutta break or over drinks later or over the pool table. If professional decisions are being taken in these settings, then that is a toxic workplace for a woman to be in. Because you are telling, you're creating a system where an employee has no choice but to stay after hours. And that could even be a man. It could be a man who says, I do want to go back home to my kids or even to watch TV after hours and I don't want to sit here up beyond 6pm or beyond working hours. So you have created an incentive system where people are forced to make these choices. So men and women, they're all reacting to the best of their own respective limitations and circumstances. But the simple solution to this is that bosses need to reflect on this and see that are we really giving an undue advantage to a colleague who's able to go to stay longer or hang out after hours. There is up to a certain limit, it is team building beyond which it is a boys club. So you know, things like meet on a meeting after hours ki jaga, why not meet on a, dedicate an afternoon and invite families, let people bring their kids and their spouses. It's a much more wholesome environment where women can also participate and you can do team building in a more healthier environment, more equitable environment. So there are small steps like this, many of which I've mentioned in the post also. But it's right now, at least at the workplace, these biases are relatively easier sorted out, but it needs that amount of reflection from the CEOs, organizations, bosses."

        "message": "Yeah, and the key point is that it's actually in the self interest of the bosses and the CEOs to take this into account. Like, I keep referring to this study, which I discovered through Philip Tetlock's book Super Forecasting, where he points out that when a group is making a decision, the most important factor in the quality of the decision is not the education or the intelligence of the people involved, it is a diversity. The more diverse a group you get, you will get better decisions, which when you think about it is so obvious that it even seems banal, that obviously, you have different viewpoints colliding, you're more likely to reach a good decision. So it is therefore, in the interest of bosses to build diverse workplaces. And I think there was a study in the US a while back a few years ago, which also showed that companies which discriminate do worse in the market. So purely from a position of self interest, you want a diverse workplace. And in this particular context, that means involving the women as deeply in decision making as the men are involved. And a boys club really gets in the way of that, because then you're kind of shutting the women out. But you know, how you get to those solutions becomes something, you know, it's complicated, as you've pointed out. Another point that you mentioned in the context of offices is the different ways in which we treat maternity and paternity. Maternitically, it's understood that even if it's fought, but it's understood that women need to go, they need to spend time with the kids and all of that. But paternity leave, even when it is there on the rolls, you know, men are frowned upon, if they actually take it. I think you quoted someone who mentioned that people in his office when he took paternity leave, they told him, quote, you will understand at the time of appraisal that you shouldn't have taken it. Stop quote. The expectation being, okay, there's a baby on Sunday, but you come to the office on Wednesday, people will congratulate you, and then you go to the meeting, because there's someone"

And if it does hurt careers, if your bosses are going to feel that, hey, this guy is not committed enough, you know, why is he going back home wife to her? So does it then create a disincentive towards that kind of caring parenthood, if your office environment is kind of like this? And does one see, does one see a drift towards change? And this is perhaps a separate question, so you can take it after this. But in the office context, does one see a drift towards change?

And this is something we predicted before it happened, because you're changing the incentives. So the intentions were great, the outcomes have been bad, and I still feel that while it's a problem you absolutely have to address, a law is such a blunt weapon and can backfire so spectacularly, as seems to have happened in this case, but I'm sorry, carry on."

        "message": "Yeah, no. So the solution I want to propose also addresses that problem. And I agree with you that the law has been very blunt. But also, I mean, if we think of it as a baby steps evolution, so first thing, at least give women time to recuperate and at least six months of breastfeeding for the infant is good and so on and so forth. So for all these reasons, good, you gave women time to sit at home and bond with the babies. But I also think that that is exactly where lies the genesis of gender roles in a marriage and therefore later in a household. And honestly, if you had to tell me that Mahima, you can change one thing in the world, I would say change this. Give all men equal and compulsory paternity leave. So first of all, compulsory makes it not no longer voluntary, like right now, there is it is suggested, itna le lo, thoda sa, zyada kam, and then the boss will give dhamki of appraisal and then make you come to office anyway, or sometimes the man anyway doesn't want to go. So he will use the boss as an excuse. The reason why I think one thing I would change in the world is compulsory paternity leave. My bigger reason is personal, not professional, which is that I feel that up to a marriage without children, it is relatively still possible to maintain an equal marriage in the relatively equal relationship where both partners have their own personal space, professional space, have their own identities, their own and then pursuing their things in life, growing together, love, blah, blah. The critical point beyond which gender roles take over, and in my opinion, 99.99% of marriages in India are unequal. And I'm just leaving 0.01% so that people don't get angry at me because not all marriages hashtag not all marriages. But otherwise, I have never met any couple which has an equal marriage, including my own. So when that happens, the critical point is when you have your first baby, because after having a baby is a transformative experience for the primary caregiver. I'm not saying mother, I'm saying primary caregiver. Whoever is bonding with a baby in their infancy, their brain goes through biological chemical changes. They become much more aware of all the, you know, primal risks to the baby's safety. We're all animalistic programming, which is that when you're caring for an infant, you're always on the lookout for what all can hurt them, which is how in my house, you will find no sharp edges anywhere, like fully baby proofed and I walk into a room and now my brain automatically goes to all the sharp edges where a child can get hurt, even if there's no child in the room. So that's the kind of reprogramming that your brain goes through in those early months. And there's a bonding with a child. And then there's an awareness of all the mental load that goes with the child, which is, diaper khatam hone wale hain, bachcha bada ho gaya hain, itna hi kapde kharidne hain. There's all of these small, small things which add up. And over time, in the mother's mind, because mothers are the primary caregivers in 100% of Indian marriages, in the mother's mind, all of this reprogramming has happened. And the father is not around when this is happening, because there is no compulsory paternity leave. And if it is, it's, government gives 15 days, which is I think the best right now, because private sector mein toh I've heard of men who were doing emailing from the hospital also. So even Monday to, sunday ko baby aur wednesday ko office bhi nahi hain, it's literally on the day they are working. So it's much worse in private sector, but also there in every sector. So making it compulsory forces the man to be there, even if it is, I'm not saying that all men need to be forced to be around their kid, but many men will think of it as, yes, fatherhood is important to me. But also at the same time, their primary identity in their mind is that I am general manager so and so, I am senior associate so and so, I am vice president so and so. That is, to my mind, most men have their primary identity as that, whereas for me as a woman, I also had that primary identity until three years back and then my brain got reprogrammed and today my primary identity is that I'm a mother. If you ask me who are you, first thing I will think of is that. So that identity shift does not happen in men because they are not around in those initial crucial months. And I think if they were around for that period, then even the most hardened of men would actually come to see life from the perspective of a caregiver, which is how women see it. And it would equalize so much, it would solve so many problems. And coming to what you said about how policy has unintentionally disadvantaged women, if you made it compulsory for men also, then that disadvantage and mismatch goes, right. Now the company has no added advantage in hiring a man over a woman because chhe maina dono ko hi dena padega, agar pacha hua toh. There is another aspect that once I wrote this post, HR head of one of the biggest startups in India actually discovered it after I wrote this because he had written a book about it and then he wrote to me and we did a call and he said that I want to talk to you about this and drill down. And his thing was that Indian government has forced it on companies and it is unviable for many companies to give you full salary for six months. And in many other countries, the government subsidizes it or you have between a couple, you have one year of leave, toh chahe chhe maina tum chhe maina main, chahe aage peeche, chahe teen nao, we can divide it, but the government will subsidize our firms for taking it. So, there are many models of making it more doable and practical and viable. But at the end of the day, I feel very strongly that compulsory and equal paternity leave for men has to be the lever."

Like first of all, the reason the maternity law backfired so spectacularly is for many firms is simply they're not viable. If you're a five person firm, and you're hiring a sixth person, you know, it is not rational to hire someone who could then just go off on a paid leave for six months, you can't afford it, your company could go down if something like that happens. Now it is unfortunate, but it is rational, and I think Tim Lee's had once forecast at the time this law came out that it would lead to a loss of between eight to 11 lakh jobs for women. So forgive me if I get the figure wrong, but I'll link to those pieces by Devika and Suman in the show notes. And the problem that would then happen if you may be you're saying that make it make a compulsory paternity leave for men as well, which would solve the problem. It actually wouldn't, because then it would create a bias for hiring unmarried men, with whom this danger wouldn't be there. Like honestly, any, you know, there are a lot of social problems, which can only be solved through voluntary means through social action, you bring the coercive hand of the state in, it leads to all kinds of perverse outcomes, as has happened with the maternity leave act, which has really harmed women. You know, you might think intention is great, you're guaranteeing something that every woman should be entitled to, but the point is, she's not getting that job in the first place, you know. So you have to look at outcome and not intentions, which in my view is, you know, the most common mistake people make about public policy."

If you're a woman, we'll give you six months maternity leave. Let somebody else say, we'll give you eight months. Let somebody say, paternity leave six months, we'll give you, let them compete on that front. But before they compete on that front, what is important is that those things, six months paternity leave, etc, etc, become attractive enough for society at large, for it to be viable for companies to compete on that front. And for that you need a change in social attitudes, which happens at a glacial pace, which society might even go backwards sometimes. But the point is, a coercive hand of the state won't get there.

As literally, it was like a slow work week at womaning, and I wrote that post, like everyone knows this story, let's write this this time. And somehow it just caught on, and to this day, I get screenshots from people that, you know, I'm on so and so WhatsApp group, and randomly someone's posted your Raja Beta piece there and I'm like, he's still roaming around. But it has, it took a life of its own. So Raja Beta Syndrome is essentially that in the Indian, average Indian family, we will treat our boys as royalty, right from the day they're born. And even before they're born, we are doing gender selection of children, infants and fetuses. But even the, and during childhood, obviously, partial treatment to the son. But the interesting bit is that even after they grow into adults, we continue to treat our sons like Rajas and princes actually, Rajkumar. So and then it's a very common, in the Hindi belt at least, thing for parents, especially mothers to say, yeh mera Raja beta hai."

And theek hai for jab tak wo beta chhota sa beta hai, theek hai, ab banao Raja beta hai. And there is obviously no Rani beti, but fir bhi, ab banao, ab theek hai, it's a, it's a child ultimately, and it's getting love. It's sad that the other child is not getting as much love, but children, all children receive and deserve love. So theek hai, up to that point, it's fine. But the funny thing is when you grow up and you're a 40 year old man and 60 year old man and you're still the Raja beta of the house, that's where it gets funny. So this, this piece is a compilation of many stories from women about how many of them are in quote unquote equal marriages where the man is also doing the dishes, the man is also helping in the kitchen and couple, especially before children, like I said, it is possible to have some semblance of equality or equity. And chal riya life waisi, but suddenly, saas-sasur aake rehna shuru inge and women have said that we visibly see a difference in our husbands, that they just turn into some other creatures and they turn into this creature called Raja beta, which is ke paani ka glass utha karke kitchen mein nahi rakhna hai. So there's a story there about how there's this couple settled in London and she's, the wife is working at her desk and she tells the husband, can you just refill my glass of water and he does it and the mother-in-law who's visiting them is horrified and next time she's keeping an eye on that glass, ke kab iska paani thoda kam ho and runs and picks up that glass and goes back to the kitchen to refill it, ke kahi mein Raja beta ko ungli nahi uthaani par jaye, should not have to lift a finger. And so similarly, ke bartan karte hua, acha nahi lagta beta karta hua, main kar dungi. So mothers-in-law are most guilty of this, ke don't disturb him, I will do this. There's a story of a mother whose breastfeeding mother just gone back to work, so life is as stressful as it can be. And she says, I come back home and my mother-in-law is already in the kitchen, the husband has reached before but he's watching TV and mother-in-law has already got a list of chores ready for me. When I still have to feed the baby, I still have come back after a long commute from work, this fellow sitting at home working from home and watching TV and if I try to involve him also in the chores, she'll come and physically body-block me that nahi, nahi, usko disturb mat karo, wo aaraam kar raha hai. Physically body-block me? Basically, yeah, that happens. So I mean, so that's, those were the stories that I got from many women and I put them together and I used this from the movie Mughal-e-Azam and how Dilip Kumar ke around sab log dance chal raha hai, pyaar kiya toh dar na kiya, sab log usko aankhe wo, Anarkali usko gulab deti hai aur Raj Mata is looking at him with those heart-shaped eyes and so that's pretty much how it plays out in most Indian households and it really struck a chord. Like I said, for me it was a very obvious, almost banal thing that I wrote but then when I wrote, put it out, women were like this, yahi, yahi toh hai, sachai, yahi hai asliyat and so to this day, it's being circulated. I keep getting messages of people who've just discovered it and loved it."

So they are mimetic desires in the sense that you want something because somebody else wants it or it seems like something that is you start desiring it not for rational reasons of your own, but because it seems something like that.

But it's just the way that life unfolds and therefore you're supposed to do it. And is this a sort of chakra view that women are then trapped in, that once you enter the flow of things, it's incredibly hard to get out. So even if you're in a, you know, relatively modern marriage where you and your partner can decide that you don't want to do it, but despite that, those pressures are sort of there. It's just this constant din in your head."

So yeah, there is a thing, timeline about you have to be married by this age. And again, that timeline is much more flexible for men than for women, not just for biological reasons, but also social reasons. So a 40 year old man is still, obviously our single son, but a 30 year old single woman is just the worst thing that has happened to our parents ever. So that's, I've also been on the receiving side of it because by Punjabi standards, I married late. And so my single status was like a societal issue being discussed often at large social gatherings. And so, I mean, again, credit to my parents that they didn't let a lot of that pressure transfer to me. And I also very consciously was living across, halfway across the country to avoid that. But it is real, it was not a big desire for me in my life at that point of time. But it was just something that you, thin desire is something that you want because you're supposed to want it, essentially. So it was just that, oh, you should want to get married because you should want to get married. There's no better reason for it. And in that rush for these thin desires, we also ignore the quality aspect of it, that it should be a good marriage is not something that's on the agenda. It has to be a marriage. That is all that we want, right, from women, shadi karlo bas, kisi se karlo. So and over time, even our standards of the kind of guy will keep falling because tumhara shelf life khatam ho raha hai. So it's actually getting worse as you're aging because your prospects will be much thinner. And many points in my life, I've been told that I will not be able to find a husband while I was single for various reasons. So so yeah, this is this this pressure is real on women and the pressure similarly to have kids is very real. And I think I've given an example of a woman who was in an abusive marriage also, who was being forced ke bachcha karlo. So that's another very classic Indian thing ke you are in already in a toxic relationship which which needs to end, which deserves to end, which should be ended. And instead, the solution that society chipkaos on it is bachcha karlo. And bachcha is not going to solve a bad marriage, it's going to make things worse, because bachcha is a huge amount of responsibility. And you should not bring a child into a marriage that is already already disturbed in any way. I mean, I personally feel there should be an entrance exam before having kids."

But they were fucked up in their turn by fools in old style hats and coats, who half the time was soppy stern and half at one another's throats. Man hands on misery to man, it deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can, and don't have any kids yourself. Stop quote. And I love these lines also just as poetry man hands on misery to man it deepens like a coastal shelf. What a lovely line. Let's sort of talk about, you know, another aspect that I think is unseen to most people. And perhaps often women may not also think about it in these terms, which is mental load, which is an invisible labor of managing a household. Now I'll quote these lovely lines because, you know, you might be modest about this, but a lot of your writing really sparkles. And these lines are from the end of your post on this where you write quote, men, can I tell you a secret? If you think that the romance in your life has dwindled after a few years of marriage, it might be because your wife is now basically a grocery list trapped in the body of a woman. Try taking some of the mental load off her brain. And behold, as she begins to turn human again, stop quote. And then you point out that your husband just installed a grocery app on his phone and you love him more than ever. But elaborate on this a bit a grocery list trapped in the body of a woman. You know, elaborate on this because I, you know, someone like me, when I'm working on something during the day, I have the luxury of locking myself in my room and thinking of nothing but whatever it is that I'm working on."

There are other models of work, which, you know, the way Walter Isaacson, for example, does it switching on and off is what women are basically doing all the time. So I don't think so. I think people attack a straw man version of the book. Otherwise, as I said earlier, I agree that, you know, that women have it much harder and even some men have it much harder that you cannot, you may not always have the luck and the privilege to set aside large chunks of time. But that's not what Newport is saying. Newport is laying out a bouquet of options, but sorry, carry on."

        "message": "Yeah. So I mean, I find most of male self-help and productivity hacks and tips to be very, have to have that carry that blind spot with them that they're designed by men and for men. And it's not things that women can ever conceivably do because, again, of the gender roles that we have and the extra amount of responsibility that is thrust on women. So yeah, how, what it means to be a walking grocery list. So I am a walking grocery list and the, another analogy that my husband and I often use is tabs. Mere dimaag mein kitni tabs open hai, like on a browser. At any point of time, I'm like, I have got like dhai so tabs open in my mind. It's equivalent of how much stress it is when you have dhai so tabs open on your browser. That's how many things I'm thinking of at any given point of time. I think this conversation with you is the, probably the longest break that I have taken away from child care in probably forever since I had a kid. So I mean, even now there are things that I'm thinking of which are happening behind, I mean, what's happening with the baby. School se kisi ne pick up kiya ke nahi, khana khaya hoga ke nahi, wo face pe rash ho rahi thi uspe kisi ne cream lagayi ke nahi, wo jo school se ek note aaya tha uske liye, us din ethnic kapde pehna ke bhejne hai, wo dhula hai kurta ke nahi dhula hai, and press ho ke aagaya hoga kya hai, aur wo press wali ne itne din se phone nahi kara usko bulana hai aur ek baat karne thi uska, wo account settle karna hai and this is how my brain goes and I just go on and on and on and this is how many, most women will think. So sometimes I mean, I'm looking like my system is going to crash and I have to tell Salil that listen, too many tabs, not able to function anymore and then he'll say, okay, let's sit down and we'll write it down or something. But the fact of the matter is these tabs are not open in his mind. I mean, as much eager and genuine partner that he wants to be, these tabs are not, are only there in my mind. And then there are many, this is again, well-documented phenomena and men have many rationals, excuses, explanations for it, ke, oh ye to, you have higher standards and that's why you have these tabs, like most of the things you're thinking of don't actually need to be done. But then when they're not done is when you realize the fallout of it. So, so much work that you're doing is preemptive and it is again, therefore unseen, you know, because those women who never had those jobs, you don't know about them. So similarly, all those accidents that didn't happen because I baby-proofed the house are things that we don't know about at all because how many times he bumped his head on the edge of a baby-proof table is not something that we are keeping count of. So these are things that mental load that, that is only there on women because physical load to a lot of extent, the more evolved of partners are able to share. So like even in my household, laundry or yesab, things that the chores that we are still doing that we don't have a help for, chores are equally distributed between us. Even the time that we spend with our child is, now that I'm also after COVID doing full-time work is relatively fair division, not equal but equitable. But this is one place where there is no semblance of equalities, like 99% is only 1% there. And so, so, and it's all sorts of labor, you know, it's also about, tumhari mumme ka birthday aane wala hai, mujhe yaad hai unko ek gift kharid ki Amazon se mahaan bhejna hai. So you know, these things also, it's also emotional labor. It's also that so-and-so helped us at that time, now we should go there about to have a baby, we should go help them with this thing. All of these burdens, managing relationships, keeping the household running, even when you do have staff, the staff wants to come, bhabhi se baat karni hai, because I have this issue, mujhe us din chutti chahiye. Now you have to plan your house around that, things, ration khatam ho raha hai kitchen mein, you have to do this. And so, this is what I've written about in the piece also, and this is the, I think the second most popular piece after Raja Beta. Because again, it struck a chord with so many women, like women wrote to me after this that my husband is VP Finance in one of the biggest firms in India, and yet he's not able to manage ghar mein aata khatam ho raha hai, he's not able to keep it stocked. So am I supposed to believe that he's incompetent and he's not able to do this? Obviously he's able to do this, he's intelligent enough to do it. It's just a matter of kar rahi hai na woh, why should I step up? And so over time, then one person gets stuck with that role. And then that person also gets stuck in their mind about the way it is to be done. So you know, like your podcast, how you edit it, how you design it, something you've been doing for so long that now, it might not even be easy for you to delegate some key aspect of it. Or if I come and do it for you, you might not like it the way I've done it. And so that also happens. So it then, even when men try to help, sometimes women will push back. And it happens to me also. Sometimes I'll say, you're doing it all wrong, let me do it myself. Aur tumne galat tarah ka chawal order kar di. So now I will do it, I have to do everything myself. And then we'll have a discussion about it, then I'll realize that, you know, I'm right now gatekeeping something that I don't really have to, and I need to consciously let go of this. Because I've been doing it for so long, and I've become set in the way that I do it. And therefore the man feels ke not worth the trouble, let her handle it. But that in the long run breeds this resentment and this gap, the chasm between us of how many tabs are open in whose mind."

He describes this kind of situation, where people are constantly forced to be in a state of shallow work. And really, being in a state of shallow concentration is something that is good only for managers who are scheduling meeting after meeting after meeting. But to get any meaningful work done, you need to figure out a way to get deep work. So you know, so often, progressive people will almost in a sense, even women kind of look down on housewives and housewifery, as it were, and will think, oh, okay, if you're a modern woman, you have to work.

It means that it's unnecessary to add the word working, because every woman is working. So it's only that some women are being paid for that work and some are not. So there's literally just no woman who's not working, even a stay at home mother is a working mother. And that for me was a very powerful statement. And it really makes sense. Because especially now I've seen being at home for two years for the pandemic before that on my maternity leave, and I've realized how hard it is. And I completely agree with Anu there that, you know, now that I go to a workplace, it's really recreation for me, it is relaxation. Like as a mother who is at home, you genuinely don't have time to poop in peace. Because there's always the door is open, because you're worried the child will go and put their finger in an electric socket or something. So often children are inside the bathroom when you're pooping. You don't get time to comb your hair, you barely get time to take a shower. Sometimes you don't remember if you brushed your teeth this morning or not. So that's the amount of stress that work is. And it is a work which comes with no perks, no compensation, and no breaks, right? Like if I have a very, very stressful work also, there is a weekend to look forward to, there is an evening where I clock out, something to look forward to. But as a mother, stay at home mother, there is no break, there will never be a day when you get, kya aaj bachche nahi, aaj chhutti hai bachche hone se, aur aaj relaxation hai. Unless your partner is kind enough to take them out of the house for a few hours. But other than that, it's a 24-7 job. So it's much more stressful and I mean, I've quoted Anu here because Anu and I used to work together when we were both single and living in Bombay. We worked together in the same company and we were taking a walk somewhere around our office one day and we saw a woman at a window. And so I began this piece with that and Anu was like, ek din main wo aurat banungi, ye meri aspiration hai, wo aurat jo face mask laga ke gharke pe baith ke chai piyegi, aur din main bhaar dekhe ki, ye dekho ye gadhe jaa rahe hain office. So that was the, I mean that was a running joke between us, ke hamari life ki aspiration hai ki ghar pe baithna aur chai peena aur face mask lagana hai. But now, I mean now that we are both mothers, we realize how blind that image of a stay at home mother is and that's how unfair it is and how far away from reality that perception is."

But your point is, no, don't romanticize that."

And this useless son who's presumably healthy and not hooked up to a cylinder is standing in the kitchen and instead of taking over from his mother is taking her photo and uploads it on social media saying ki yeh hoti hai maa, yeh hoti hai sachhi maa.

That we are forcing our women to do cooking, cleaning, ghar ka samaan, bahar ka, fir office bhi jao, woh bhi sambhalo aur uske baad wahan pe boys club se bhi maar khao, idhar ghar pe patiks ke liye bhi rotiya gol banao, toh I mean if we are truly putting this much burden on women that every Mother's Day you see or every Women's Day you see that woman with eight hands, ek haath mein tawa, ek haath mein bachcha, ek haath mein laptop, ek haath mein press ironing, toh woh image jo hai that's a matter of shame and I feel that's what the women also who I interviewed for this piece were echoing. One of them said that someone put up in her office, put up a thing outside her door, superwoman because she was a working mother of two and blah blah blah, so she was like ye hatao, I don't want to be a superwoman, let me be just a woman, I want to be human, it's a privilege, it's my right to be left alone to be human and you are not giving me that right, you are forcing this superwoman down my throat, not just the person who's put up the board, society, family, everyone and by raising me, holding me to these high standards, you are getting away with murder, you are getting away with not caregiving for your children, taking care of your house and pulling your weight at either the workplace or at home and so don't make us super, we are quite happy being human and let us just be human, that's basically what the entire movement is about, let women be human."

In the same post about fabulous lives of Indian housewives, you quote someone called Meeta who is separated from her husband and you quote her as saying, quote, I have never slept better in my life, right? Elsewhere, you talk about how divorces are going up and I think 12 years or 13 years ago, I'd got a bit of flack when I wrote a column saying that rising divorce rates in India is something we should celebrate. It means that more and more women are being empowered to get out of toxic marriages, right? You've also written posts, like there's one post called the Great Indian Dhakosla. You've written a very powerful post on domestic violence as well. And this leads me to this larger sort of question about the institution of marriage itself. I think that the way the institution of marriage is conceived, that conception is toxic, right? Because men and women are kind of fixed in their roles in a way that you have, you know, outlined here, how men are the Raja betas and women are fixed and trapped and imprisoned in models of lives, which completely destroy them, like, you know, their lives are just taken away from them by these roles that they're force fitted into. And I'm just thinking that and my point is not at all that people should not get married. I've already said people shouldn't have kids. My point is not at all that people don't get married, marriage can be beautiful when you marry someone who's your friend, you've got companionship. If you choose to have a family together, there's lots that beautiful about it. But the conception of marriage as it is today, seems to me to be toxic and one sidedly toxic. I think it also in a small way harms men by trapping them in these stereotypes, which can hurt them also, but it is almost completely one sidedly toxic, it destroys women's lives, right? So, do you think in a thought experiment, as society keeps changing over decades and perhaps centuries, that this institution will appear unnecessary? That it can become possible for men and women to associate with each other to have the kind of relationships they want to have with each other by mutual consent with agreed upon roles and demarcations without this actual institution and all the negativity that it carries?"

One of them was about dating in your 40s, 50s and 60s. And that is the one that I love the most. I think the biggest scam in society today is that women are, young women and girls are conditioned to see marriage as an achievement or a trophy. And so you'll have these tropes and based on reality, that the woman is chasing the man for proposing and the man is like commitment phobic and running away from it. I've had that experience myself, plenty of commitment phobic men, but it's now in hindsight I'm like, what is wrong with us for chasing this institution, which is so disadvantageous to us, like you said, unidirectionally toxic, right? So I mean, it makes, and there's a lot of research there about it, about how married women have a shorter lifespan than unmarried women. Married men have a longer lifespan than unmarried men. So it's obvious who the institution of marriage is benefiting more in terms of happiness, longevity, health, all dimensions. It's obvious that marriage is better for men than it is for women. And so the trope should be that men should be chasing women around the street, that please"

That's a whole other problem, but I'm saying between consensual relationships, one common trope is that women should marry and men shouldn't, at least in the young age. That's why I love that post about dating in your 40s, 50s, 60s, because so one very interesting and my favorite, one of my favorite insights that I got interviewing women who are dating at that age was that by this age, most of us have had one marriage at least, right? So the men are also divorced or widowed, women are also divorced or widowed, only few are single at that age. So after having had one experience of marriage, all the women have figured out, this is not a trap I want to fall into, mujhe nahi firse kisi ki mummy banna, like that's what Indian men are looking for in their wives is mummy, toh mujhe nahi banna apne partner ki mummy. So she said that at this stage of life, and the reverse has happened for the men because they realized how comfortable and luxurious their life was when they had this person doing invisible caregiving work for their family and them. And somewhere in the background, magically chai ke cups are being produced and food is appearing on the table and you don't have to worry about kichan mein chawal khatam because somebody else is thinking about it all the time. So men have figured out the comforts of marriage and women have figured out the traps of it. And so at that age, she told me that it's oolta, like every man I date is looking to set, so quote unquote settle down and wants to immediately get married. And women are like, sorry, casual. So it's amazing. I loved it. That at least now, slowly, even after having had a bad experience, at least at some stage and age, you are, we are all becoming conscious of this and the right gender is chasing that institution and the right one is running away from it finally."

Let's, let's, you know, talk about like, like we've spoken in the context of offices and air conditioners and toilets, how the world is sort of designed by men for men, and so on and so forth. And another instance of this is the health of women, like at one point, you talk about how women are often blindsided by biology, you know, you talk about the problems of menstruation, but I was struck by this quote here, where you write, quote, according to the Guardian, in the UK, and this is a Guardian's words in the UK, less than 2.5% of publicly funded research is dedicated solely to reproductive health, despite the fact that one in three women suffers from a reproductive or gynecological, gynecological, sorry, my pronunciations are bad health problem, that there is five times more research into erectile dysfunction, which affects 19% of men than into premenstrual syndrome, which affects 90% of men, stop code, right. And you also pointed out about how, you know, there'll be so much more research into say type two diabetes, because, you know, men also have it as opposed to something like PCOS. Right. So sort of tell me a little bit about this, therefore, and also specifically about how menstruation isn't taken seriously enough, especially by men who just, you know, who will brush it off and say, oh, it's that time of the month again, or she's PMSing again, or whatever. But for women, it is such a huge issue that impacts their life in such a big way."

        "message": "Yeah. So I had this friend, a flatmate I used to live with when I first moved to Bombay, and she used to have very, very painful periods, like, I was fortunate enough that periods for everyone there, there is discomfort, but it was not like crippling. For her, it was, she had to take two months, two days off a month. And that was basically the extent of on leave we got. So every month, her on leave would go for this, because she would literally be bound on the bed, and I would often come home to see her crying. And once or twice she told me, and we used to live on the 11th floor, and she told me I want to throw myself off out of this window to just to end this misery. And I was, I was, I would be genuinely very scared for her and her safety, her health. And I have so many times we've discussed, we should see a doctor. And no doctor was able to say anything, that's basically the response she would get. Some would say, that will solve it. Today, she has a kid and it hasn't solved it. So by the way. So and much later in life, I came across a post about, I think it's called endometriosis, which is that menstruation cycle is the endometrial wall shedding itself. And that process of that shedding is sometimes exceptionally painful. And it's like a pain that most people will not be able to tolerate. I mean, it's very high grade pain. And people are, women are not only going through it, but they are coming to work, doing, working alongside men, performing equally well, sometimes better than them, while bearing that pain. And there is nothing that the medical science is doing to address it. So endometriosis is one of the many conditions, like you said, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, most types of cancers that affect only women. All of this is like very, very exceptionally poorly funded. So even when the COVID vaccine came out, I went for the vaccine and they asked me, are you still feeding your baby? And I wasn't at the time, so I could get the vaccine. But if you were feeding your child, just the jury is out. We don't know. Can you take it or not? We don't know. Pregnant women can't take it and lactating women also can't, we won't suggest it. Why? Because you have not done any research on it. So COVID vaccine was made in a very crunch situation, but almost all, almost completely all of medical science is tuned towards the needs of men, even when it is recreational needs like erectile dysfunction, not to diminish what kind of condition that must be, but again, it's just about numbers."

So there is this definite big gap in just medical funding. The second thing that I want to talk about and I've written a couple of pieces about it is also the medical response, the response of the medical community to women, women's pain and women's needs. So I've written a piece about how the men are seen as, you know, brave and putting up a brave face where women are hysterical. So brave men and hysterical women, that's the name of the piece that when a man says, I'm in pain, this man is so brave, he's tolerating the pain. And when a woman says, I'm in pain, she's hysterical, she just has a low pain threshold. Whereas the fact is that women will go through pain, which is often much worse than anything men will ever experience. So like the pain of delivery, for instance, is worse than the pain of losing a limb. So if I chopped off a person's arm, it would hurt them less than it hurts to deliver a baby. And almost every woman does it in her life, or at least everyone who's having a vaginal birth will do it. And so there is not enough pain relief for women. In fact, I've written a piece on obstetric violence, which is just horrifying stuff that is done to women who are during labor. My friend who's a doctor, she told me that in districts, in hospitals, they used to lay four women on a steel bed at a time, so that they get hurt. They'll just strip off their clothes and in that indignified position, they'll say, okay, start pushing. And my friend, she said, I was doing an episiotomy, which is a scary thing that is done during labor. And she said that I was giving her anesthesia because it's a cut you have to put in the vagina. And she said, before cutting, I was giving her an anesthesia injection, and the nurse came and said, ma'am, why are you wasting the injection on her, she's already in pain, let it be a little more. And I've spoken to women who have been, a friend of mine, she was a nurse practitioner, and she said that, I've seen women being slapped during labor, that why are you yelling, slapping. We were slut-shamed during her labor, that it was a lot of fun having sex, now we know how painful it is. So, you know, things like this, it's inhuman, it's unimaginable that this is the way we are treating women for, our mothers, our sisters, whom we respect so much in our speeches, when they are becoming mothers, at that time, we treat her like, like vermin. There is, there are stories now, and in India, it is not as well documented. I've read papers about it in the US, where there is better documentation of it, or for example, there was a doctor who tied a woman's legs together, so she couldn't deliver a baby, so he could go take his lunch break, okay, I want to have a quick lunch, just so she doesn't deliver while I'm away, tie her legs together. So I mean, it's just, it's criminal, inhuman, animals would not behave like this, I mean, I don't want to insult animals by calling this animalistic behavior. So it's, that's the kind of caregiving that we give to women, and I was, I myself had a very, very difficult birth because of the, because my caregiver, my, my doctor saw me as a baby-carrying vessel, like I've written. So it was, ke, ha tumko yeh dard ho raha hai, yeh problem hai, ha toh yeh toh hoga hi na, bachcha peda karna hai toh yeh sab nahi, jhelogi kya, jao jhelo. And so, I mean, the standing joke between many moms is that, if men were supposed to give birth, or have periods, we would have five-star lounges all over the place, ki jao, kahan jaake paanch din check-in karlo, aur aaraam se period karke aa jaana, like that, those are the facilities we would provide if men were going through these things. But because it is women going through them, we are treated as, just, I mean, as, as vermin, like I said, ke, mein tab kuch fark hi nahi pad raha hai tumhari, your, your suffering is, is meaningless to us, and in fact, it's well-deserved because you're a woman, and this is your lot."

Women don't lose their minds when they have period related irritability. It doesn't lower their ability to reason, it lowers their patience, and hence tolerance for bullshit. If an issue comes up a lot during that time of the month, that doesn't mean she only cares about it once a month. It means she's bothered by it all the time, and lacks the capacity once a month to shove it down and bury it beneath six gulps of willful silence, stop quote. And so sort of expressive there, let's, let's talk about safety, for example, you know, and, you know, earlier, I had, you know, quoted Natasha, who you spoke to in your post about should we lock up all the women, where she spoke about the paranoia, or what men would call paranoia that every time she enters a public space, she's looking, she's making sure where is the exit route, where can I escape? What do I have to defend myself with? And at one point, you write, quote, no matter who the fault lies with, it is a woman's freedom that gets curtailed. And that has conditioned us to be wary to the point of paranoia, stop quote. And Kavita Krishnan wrote a great book called Fearless Freedom about this. She was on my show as well. And here's the thing. And I'm going to circle back to something that you mentioned about your engineering college in Kurukshetra, right, that women weren't supposed to go out, if 4.30 classes are over, you have to stay in the hostel till 5.30, you know, you managed to fashion out of thin air and aunt in Karnal, but otherwise, that's generally where you're stuck. And I was chatting with Alice Evans yesterday. And I don't know, and she's, of course, a researcher on gender. And I don't know whether this episode will come before that or what the order will be. But she pointed to what she calls an honor income trade off, right, where she's looking into the question of why don't more women work in the subcontinent that question gets complicated, elsewhere in the world, if your economic opportunities go up for women, and the incentives go in that direction, then more women can work. But over here, there is an honor, income trade off, in the sense that it is not only the income, there is a drive towards female seclusion, that families believe that their honor can get sullied if the woman goes out, because she could get abducted or raped or have an affair or whatever. And to protect their honor, that they have this drive towards female seclusion. And Alice was pointing to this study by two fine economists whom I also bumped into recently at a conference with Vidya Mahambre and Soumya Dhanraj. And Alice told me about this. So this is secondhand. I haven't read that study myself yet, because the recording just happened yesterday. But the study apparently talks about this factory, which employs women, but which kind of herds them to the factory in a very protective sort of environment, there are strict timings, and then it deposits them back safely at home. And in a sense, this is supposed to be a feature, not a bug, because in the families of those women can feel safe, ki theek hai kuch nahi hoga. So the urge to female seclusion, therefore, doesn't become such a big factor. And in that honor income trade off, the honor is less of a worry, because the factory is, you know, taking the women in such a cloistered way in and out of the factory. And therefore, the income part plays more of a part in the women actually work. Now, I was thinking, you know, this came to mind when you spoke of the hostel in Kurukshetra, therefore, being able to tell the parents of young girls that your girls are safe here. So on the one hand, I agree with you that the rule is deeply misogynistic, that the men can lie around drinking in campus all night, but the women have to be there by 5.30. Obviously misogynistic. But the problem that it is solving for is also a misogynistic problem, the honor income trade off for which many parents may say ki meri beti college nahi jaayegi. But then if you tell her ki theek hai, aapke beti ko jaane do, wo safe hai, aise roles hai, usko theek se rakhenge, and then they might agree. And the larger point which I am therefore coming at is that I think sometimes what happens is we see a problem, and we want a utopian solution where everything just disappears. So the ideal world that I want to live in is where the rule of law is enforced, where college authorities, police, they all do their job, women are safe, and men and women at any point of night can go out and do whatever the hell they want. But there would be an argument that you are not going to get there overnight, that there are compromises and trade offs that you make on the way there. So in isolation, something like this that seems misogynistic, is actually making the other deeper problem, the honor income trade off, which has women cooped up at home, it's actually helping in at least making baby steps towards progress. So how do we think about this? Because a lot of what we see in our society is regressive. But is it also something we should do that we should look at the trend across time and see if things are getting better. So I'm kind of thinking aloud, because this thought was sparked off by what you mentioned earlier there in my conversation with Alice yesterday. But I think you get the drift. And the drift and the broad question is, how should we think about progress?"

You want to work, you work, you don't want to work, you sit at home, and applies to both men and women, as long as financially things are taken care of. So that's the end stage, of course. But I see the honor income trade off, and it reminded me of a story while you were talking about how this building, somebody, I know, guard was spreading a rumor, that here in this flat, this mother and daughter have come, and this mother gets her daughter to do business. And this man, the guard says, I see at night. And then people like, somebody questioned further, how do you know, what did you see? And then he was like, and then later they found out she was working at a call center, which has overnight work, but again, like you say, you know, the mindset is that family honor is being saluted because the girl is going out to work at night. And the other point about public safety that I have made in that piece that you're referring to, is also not so much about the end stage of streets are safe for everybody. It's also about while the streets are unsafe, who are we holding responsible for the mishaps that are going down, the crimes that are going down? Are we holding the perpetrators of those crime responsible or the victims? So, if a woman is getting assaulted on the street, are we asking her, itne baje kya kar nahi, yeh skirt ki length kitni thi, kya kaam karne gayi thi, padhai karne gayi thi, ke kisi friend se milne gayi thi, padhai karne is vulnerable, friend se milne is not. Pitchar dekhne gayi thi, then you deserved it totally. You know, if you were drunk, then you were asking for it. So that, that's basically the question that I have raised in that piece. And it's, the book that I've referred to, which we can also link is called Violator, which is a whole movement, not about let's make streets safer for women as much as even before that. Let's at least accept that on our unsafe street, women's are, it's unsafe for women, but the solution is not to lock up the women. It is to do something about that safety question. And if something happens, give women the right to make these quote unquote mistakes. You say that itne baje wahan jaana was a mistake because you got assaulted when you went there. First of all, she didn't make the mistake. He committed a crime. So let's get that clear first, because the headlines will always say woman raped in Noida at night. It will never say man raped woman in Noida at night. That's never the headline. So let's first turn the narrative around and hold the perpetrator responsible for the lack of safety and the crime. And second, let's allow women the right to make these quote unquote mistakes. Theek hai, jaao raat ko jaao, jaaha jaana hai jaao, jo pehna hai pehno. We are adults, you are making choices, keeping your own safety and your other parameters in mind. So let's at least give women the right to do that. If a man gets mugged at night, batua chori ho gaya, kisi ne bhusa maar diya, toh hum toh nahi kehate hai na, it's your fault, you should have not gone there. What were you wearing? What were you wearing? Yeah. Batua mein itte rupe the kyu? No one asks these questions to a man, but they'll say that area is unsafe, wahan ke ladko ne yeh kar diya, attack kar diya humare izzat daar samajh ke members ko. Then we'll be upset with the perpetrators. So why is it that we are upset with the victim when it's a crime against a woman?"

        "message": "Yeah, you'd made a great post on this called the burden of language. And the quote that I like to give to illustrate how language matters so much is by Jackson Katz. And what Katz had said was, quote, we talk about how many women were raped last year, not about how many men raped women. We talk about how many girls in the school district were harassed last year, not about how many boys harassed girls. We talk about how many teenage girls got pregnant in the state of Vermont last year, rather than how many men and teenage boys got girls pregnant. So you can see how the effect of this passive voice has a political effect. It shifts the focus of men and boys and on to girls and women. Even the term violence against women is problematic. It's a passive construction. There's no active agent in the sentence. It's a bad thing that happens to women. It's a bad thing that happens to women. But when you look at that term violence against women, nobody is doing it to them. It just happens."

And it's just a way in which language matters. By the way, this Jackson Katz quote was pointed out to me by one of your fellow writing course participants, Rita Mishra. And yeah, so I completely agree. In just going back to the progress question, and again, I'm thinking aloud, like you've written another great post about how when, when a man says something like, oh, I allow my wife to work, right? And obviously, that's such a patriarchal asshole way of saying that it's like, you know, that she's your property, and you have to allow her to work. But the other way of thinking about it is at least a woman is working, right? You take baby steps, you take one step at a time, that perhaps that sure, his, his tone, his approach that I'm allowing her to work is a problem. But it is a much bigger problem when she was actually literally not being allowed to work. And perhaps you have to take baby steps to kind of go ahead."

What I'm saying is that there are gradations to this, I mean, so let me turn that question about progress around and say that, what is your sense of how much progress women have then made? You know, what your newsletter does so well, is that it tells you that on so many margins, things really suck, things are really bad. And we are in full agreement about all of that. Has there been progress? Is that progress? Is there a trend line that you can see to this? I mean, just looking at Me Too, for example, at one level, I was pretty optimistic that things will change, perhaps too optimistic, because I thought this, at least changes the incentives for men. Even if men don't start behaving better deeply from inside, at least it changes their incentives. Now, I don't know how much of that is really true. MJ Akbar is still getting invited to literature festivals, Tarun Tejpal is still a social gadfly on the circuits, and of course, you have a great post about Mr. Tejpal also, you know. So, what is your sense of the progress that has happened and the progress that is happening? Because the older feminists have spoken to on this show in the past from Kavita Krishnan to Manjima Bhattacharya, and so on, will say that there has been progress, it is slow, but let's appreciate that there has been progress, and things will not suddenly change overnight. Right? So, what's your sense as, you know, a younger feminist and then maybe a generation down, though I know you don't use that word, of course."

I have at least two young readers who have written to me, one was 12, and one is 13. And the 13 year old wrote to me after the Tarun Tejpal post incidentally, and I was horrified, because at that point, I had no idea that I had an audience, teenage audience out there and the Tarun Tejpal post is stark. I mean, it talks in graphic detail about the crime that happened against the woman and exactly what transpired that night, because it is important to interpret, those facts are important to interpret the judgment, because at every point, there is a crime happening against the woman and at every point, the judgment is putting the blame on the woman for all the crimes happening against her. So I had written that post and it was quite out there in explicit in the language and the exact nature of the crime that happened, and then I was horrified that a 13 year old read it and was feeling personally responsible for should I be censoring these things. But then the message she sent me was, I mean, it was so moving. She said that, ma'am, I read your post and it was so enlightening for me, there is rape culture and women are being raped and victimized and then our legal system is not able to give justice. And I just, I mean, at 13, I had none of these ideas, I could not use these words, this language. Not that I felt not empowered enough to use them, but that language was not in my mind at all. I was not thinking about these issues, I would certainly not have been able to articulate them as well as she did. And so that, then the other 12 year old reader I'm talking about is the daughter of one of our batchmates in the clear writing cohort, and he told me that she, every Monday she waits for the post and she sits and refreshes, aaya ki nahi aaya, aaya ki nahi aaya. So then I was like, yaar usko subscribe kara do, usko bohot jayega main box mein. And then he said that she sits and waits for that post and then she reads it and then Saturday ko she makes us sit down, ke mummy papa baitho, ab hum is hafte ki womaning post ke aare baat karenge, ke Mahima aunty ne kya likha hai, aur kya wo hamare ghar mein ho raha hai, and what can we do better."

And it is amazing to me that, wo fourth standard mein thi, aur uski textbook mein, you look at doctor, scientist, engineer, judge, all are men, nurse, secretary, teacher, these are women, and she was, she saw this, and in fourth standard, she was upset by this, enough to tell her dad, that why, why are women shown only in these roles and not in those roles? Can I not become a doctor when I grow up? Can I not become a judge when I grow up? And I am upset that these are the messages coming to women, and who is the author of this book? I will write a letter to them. And in fourth standard, it blew my mind that this happened to any individual in this country. And therefore, that makes me optimistic about the future. I know these are, so I know this is anecdotal evidence, and these are not like stark figures across the country kind of patterns, but I mean, I am, I am, I am amazed that even one such child exists in this country, and I'm sure it's not just one child. And therefore, the discourse is what gives me hope. The fact that there was a Me Too movement, I know it did not lead to the perfect kind of results that we wanted from it, or might have hoped for. But the fact that those conversations are happening, the fact that we recognize there's a glass ceiling, the fact that on LinkedIn, you see diversity hires for coders, and women can only apply for this position. I like it. I love all of that, that there is, I know in our panchayati raj system, we have a woman sarpanch reservation, and it leads to sarpanch patis who are controlling things from behind the woman, and she's cutting aloo sabzi at home, whereas he's signing all the papers for all the decisions to be taken in the panchayat office. Yeh hota hai. But even then, the fact that we are having these conversations, and young women of tomorrow are able to articulate these thoughts, are able to analyze these things, or are even incensed or offended by the fact that this stuff is happening around us, gives me a lot of hope. The second thing was what I said earlier about there should be an entrance exam for having kids. Because you often say that change happens one funeral at a time, but I think change also happens one birth at a time, however immoral you might think it is. And I think that if we are all able to raise the change makers of tomorrow, then we've done good jobs as parents. And so upbringing is a huge, that's why I feel like there should be an entrance exam because you should not bring up another person who's going to perpetuate the same crap that"

By the time of the first half, nothing technical has happened so far in this fictitious sector that relates to us. So really there's no feedback for us to give. But at the time of interval, pause liya and he looks, he looks around and he says that what did you all think of it, any initial thoughts and then because I'm sitting right across from him, he looks at me and says, let's start with the lady. Now if you see the first half of this film, it's basically the love story in the first half. The boy is courting the girl and when I say courting, what I mean is that she is a student, he is a cycle repairwala, probably 20 years elder to her, even in the fictitious world of the film, and is chasing her around with his mobile phone, taking pictures of her and videos of her without her consent. At one point, he prints out a photo of her on a large hoarding for his cycle shopka ad and that's supposed to show his love for her. She takes a train from one small town to another to go study to her college, wo train mein roz sube uske peeche chadta hai aur shaam ko cycle pe uska peecha karta hua ghar tak usse."

And then I was like, ke chalo, in my mind, I'm already thinking of the next job and to have to do. But luckily in the room, there was this senior lady and she was at a joint secretary level at that time and now probably going to become a secretary soon.

So I released the first episode and a lot of people like heard it and immediately on that group, a comment came on our group where these writing students are there, that one of them said that I've just had a baby a month back. And that episode, that my podcast episode is about breastfeeding and how there is this unreasonable pressure on women that pehle din se you have to be mother dairy and then you have to do exactly for this many days aur iss se kam kiya toh you are an unworthy mother, iss se zyada kiya toh what is this creepiness, why are you still feeding a child who is of X age. So I called on my podcast, these two women, one of them, she and I were both not able to breastfeed beyond a point and the other one is still breastfeeding her two and a half year old. So we were all talking about that again, you know, there's no middle ground, there is no one is eating the sweet spot of everyone's approval when it comes to these things. And so one of the women on our group said that I just had a baby and in the last one month since I've had a baby, I've felt like a monster who is not able to do something that seems to come so easily to all other women.

So shaam ko Salil comes home and I'm like, did you like it, how it was, he's like, nahi I'm still listening to Seen and the Unseen and I'm like, maine aaj podcast nikala hai, pehle episode hai, you're listening to, I understand the rest of the world, I'm putting it out on a Monday, I can't compete with Seen and the Unseen but tum toh sun lo. And he's like, nahi nahi, Amit's guest this time, she's from my school and I was like, he's in the podcast, I'm like, your wife is in this podcast, can you prioritize, please. And then on the flip side also, it happens that sometimes he'll recommend a book to me, like Rukmini's book, he would, I would be watching crap on Netflix and he would come and shove that book under my nose, yeh padho, this, you are woman and you need to read this. And then I was like, yaha padh lenge, I'm too tired right now, mental load saara off ke main, tabs thodi dair hibernation mein daal ke, I'm right now wedging, so don't come into my wedge time and yeah, I know your books, your taste is very intellectual and all, toh. But then I listened to your episode with Rukmini and I was like, yeh book toh padhni padhegi. Yeah, this is a great book, yeah. I know, right? So then he gets very upset ke, maine kaha tha toh kuch nahi, aur Amit ne kaha hai, toh padhni hai. Wow. So there's a lot of strife that you cause."

        "message": "So there's a lovely book called How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men's Feelings. It's a wonderful book, it's a collection of couple of comics by Sarah Cooper. And I mean, I think a couple of clips of this book have gone viral online about, you know, how a woman says something and the man ignores, then she puts a moustache on her face and says the same thing. And then they're like, what a great idea. So it's a hilarious book and it's talking about everything that we discussed about women not being taken seriously at work. Then Invisible Women, which I've already quoted from in this episode so far. By Caroline Priada Perez. Yes. There is a book called Untamed by Glennon Doyle. So Glennon Doyle has published books in the past as well. But this book has come out after big changes in her life. So she was earlier a drug addict and then she got married. She had a baby and immediately the day she found out she was pregnant, she quit drugs and before that it was like beyond control. It was damaging her life seriously. And then she had, I think now she has two or three kids. After a while, she also figured out that her marriage was no longer working. And then she fell in love with another woman and is now married to her. And all through this journey, she also was very, very religious, very strong Christian ethic. And I think in some ways she still is, but it comes from a very modern take on that religion. And I loved it as reading it as a woman and as a mother especially, like I love this couple of excerpts from it, which I would take photos of and share on these moms groups that I'm on. One of which was about how she said that I was raising my, I think she has two daughters and one son. And she said, I was raising my daughters to be strong women. And you know, walking down the street, I would point to a random woman and say, what do you think she is? Maybe she's a CEO, maybe she's an engineer, maybe she's a doctor. And you know, just to make them think of women as not in those traditional domestic roles, but also as beyond that and people who can accomplish anything. But then she thought that one day her son said something very regressive. And she said that, I realized that I don't need to just build strong women for the future, but also men who are ready for that future, for those women. So I realized that as a mother, I had been failing my son on that account. And so then she said that now when I walk down the street with my son, I point to men and say, what do you think he is? Maybe he's a very loving father. Maybe he makes great pasta for dinner. You know, things like that, which is again, not the traditional roles that you would see men in, but to make him think of other men like that. So he also starts seeing himself as those as valid roles that he could grow into. So that's a book I wanted to recommend. There's another book called Shrill by Lindy West. So the reason I read this book, it's a very angry book and a very funny book too. But so the reason I read this book was somebody quoted a line to it, which spoke to me, which was that feminism is about realizing that everything you love hates you back. That's the perfect summary of my relationship with Bollywood, right? I love Bollywood. I can still to this day sit and watch any old 90s regressive movie. I will find all the regressive shit in it, but I'll still enjoy it because I'm programmed to love it now. And I know it hates me as a woman, right? Like, I'm still waiting for the DDLJ joke, by the way."

        "message": "It's okay. Small things like this happen in big cities. Okay, or another thing that I wanted to recommend was another book is Steal Like An Artist. Then there's another called Show Your Work and third one called Keep Going. All three are by Austin Kleon, which are basically books that anyone who wants to write and wants to be any kind of creator or artist should just keep on their table at all times. They're very, very small books, thin, short books, very easily accessible. Kisi bhi din kuch bhi uthage, koi bhi page padlo and it'll inspire you in some way. So these are three beautiful books that I keep very accessible at hand. I also wanted to recommend a couple of stand-up comedians because I follow stand-up comedy like anything. I've also dabbled in it quite successfully, but a bit. One is Hannah Gatsby. One is Tig Notaro. And among men, there's James A. Castor and Indian side, there's a guy called Karunesh Talwar. All four of them are excellent and amazing for different reasons, which we can discuss another time. But if you haven't heard of them, please look them up. And if you enjoy stand-up comedy, they to me sound like the voice of the future."

And so, in fact, one of them was in CP in Central Park and it was, I was told by the organisers there that there was an audience of 5000 people, which I don't think was there at one time. I think they just did a total count over the evening. But there are a series of artists and for me, that memory is very great because whatever I did, I'm sure I will cringe at it today. And by the way, open challenge to all your listeners, ke koi dhond ke dikhao wo video. Wo video is somewhere in one corner of the internet. I know how to find it, but it's very hard to find because the people I did it for were kind enough to not give me any credits. So there is, you can't find it by my name probably. Anyway, so that, that thing I did and as I was getting off stage, the late Ms. Kamila Bhasin was there. She was one of the organisers of that event and she came up to me and congratulated me and shook my hand. I was like surreal because it was probably the third or fourth performance I was doing and I was like, please, what are you even saying, Ms. Kamila, you are the OG. And she was like, nahi nahi hum toh kuch nahi hain, aap artist hain, aap logon hi hain, kalki awaaz. And it was just, it was very touching and it was very surreal. Maybe I'll get back to it someday, don't know right now."
