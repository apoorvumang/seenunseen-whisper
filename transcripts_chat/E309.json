But for this year-ending episode, I didn't want big serious subjects, ponderous self-reflection, laments about the state of the world. Instead, I wanted to sit and take stock of all the things that should give us hope. I wanted life lessons that could inspire us to move forward. I often speak of hope and despair on this show. Well, in this episode, I wanted you and me to feel hopeful at the end of it. And boy, am I happy with the two friends I called on and the conversation we had. This was one of my most enjoyable conversations. And when I heard it back, I was blown away by the amount of wisdom that these two guests brought to the table, which I hadn't even noticed while recording because we were so busy having a blast. Now, I know this was a long episode, but my last episode to go over 7 hours, episode 303 with Nikhil Taneja, the loneliness of the Indian man, touched so many people so deeply that I'm still getting emails about it. I mean, I only go long when the conversation is so great that we lose track of time. So do listen to this episode as well, in parts if you have to. When you reach the end, I promise you'll ask, hey, why did it end so soon? But hey, 2022 is also ending so soon. But let's enjoy the years ahead of us and the many conversations ahead of us."

        "message": "Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guests today for the special year-end episode are my good friends Vikram Sathe and Roshan Abbas. Now, if I try to give Roshan the introduction he deserves, that only will take 7 hours. He's a radio star, a TV star, an events mogul, a filmmaker, an entrepreneur and today, a mentor and an inspiration to young creators everywhere and older ones like me. But most of all, at least for me, he's a good human being who makes me also want to be a better person. He's been on the show before, and I urge you to check out that earlier episode as well, in which he talks about his life, his learnings and the creator economy. In this episode, we spoke more about his life and learnings, and he spoke about what he learnt and unlearned while playing the role of Lalit Verma in the musical version of Monsoon Wedding, which is going to Broadway soon. How Meera Nair taught him to have the heart of a poet and the skin of an elephant. And how, as Roshan keeps telling me, one must either be interested or be interesting. And to me, Roshan is both of those, which is why he makes for such a delightful guest. My other guest today is my old buddy Vikram Sathe, also known variously as Baljeet and Parpeetaram, who was my contemporary in Ferguson College, Pune in the early 1990s, and later my colleague at MTV in the mid to late 90s. He worked in marketing then, which was kind of at odds with his past as a budding musician, singer and cricketer. Now, one of his side skills then was comedy, and one subset of his comedy skills was mimicry. He soon got known for that, entertained people with his stand-up act on cricket, and what was timepass at parties became a profession. A decade before India's stand-up explosion, Vikram was doing sold out shows and corporate events and did literally thousands of performances. He also got into cricket broadcasting and became good friends with top cricketers, just as he already was with top artists. He's one person I know who was close to both the Tendulkars, Vijay Tendulkar and Sachin Tendulkar, and one of his great skills was in imbibing life lessons from everyone he came across. He did this from both Tendulkars, he wrote a best-selling book about his journey, and then made a wildly successful YouTube show, What the Duck with Vikram Sathe, in which he spoke to top cricketers and revealed the way they think for all of us. Besides his comedy and his YouTubing, he also became a top motivational speaker, and now spends time investing his hard-earned money, paying it back as it were. I've always loved three qualities of Vikram which I try to work on for myself. One, his constant curiosity about the world. Two, his humility, despite his many achievements, which always keeps him open to learning into new experiences. And three, his good humour, the positive energy that keeps him moving forward. And hey, coming to think of it, Roshan shares these qualities as well. We explored Vikram's journey in this episode, in which he shared his learnings from Bollywood, from the corporate world, from sport, and as Roshan did as well, from life. This is one of the most enjoyable conversations I've ever had on the show, not least because of the feast of singing towards the end. Just wonderful.

Yesterday I saw this tweet from Tim Urban basically to the effect of how when you are young, you have no money, but lots of time. And as you get older, when you get to the age that we are, you have the money problem is hopefully solved, you have more money, but you have less time, time is a scarce resource. And you know, Paul Graham replied to this, you know, from an investment point of view saying that when you're building something for the young, remember that they have no money, but they have time and vice versa for older people. And I was kind of just wondering, you know, given that we are sort of middle aged, so I shouldn't, you know, say Roshan is already looking upset because he's young. Given that we are, you know, late 40s, early 50s, you know, how would you sort of think about, think about this? Like, how has this changed what you do now, as opposed to you know, how you lived your lives when you were young?"

        "message": "So, see, personally, I completely agree with the fact of saying that time becomes a scarce resource over a period of time, I mean, as you age, but somehow, if you really need to keep optimize time and expand it, the first thing that I started doing very early was I make myself redundant in every job that I do. I immediately very quickly find a replacement, teach them what I know and very quickly find a replacement, teach them what I know and move on. Because that's when I again find that free time available. During the pandemic, I hired two people, I call them my left brain, my right brain. And both of these guys actually do 150% of what I do, because 50% of what they do is stuff I could never do. I'm not good with finance, I'm not very, very good with follow up on a couple of things. You know, if you really need to analyze things, I react far more, you know, from a creative perspective, I love the idea, but I may not think so much about the execution. So all of these, you know, so they were able to take that on, they are one is 25, one is 24. You know, so I've actually, that's how I'm trying to optimize it to a certain degree. But I do feel that these two concepts, I mean, if you have to constantly look at life from money and, you know, time perspective, I somehow really look at it a little differently. I'm always just trying to see that, can you make your life richer in any way, whether it is meeting up with friends, catching up on conversation, whether it's reading, whether it's writing, whether it's, you know, going out and doing a play or doing whatever else. But I just think, you know, I think I'm just a huge enthusiast of jumping into doing things in life. Time expands or contracts to fill the space, I think, you know, as work does at the same time."

Because for me, as I mentioned to you in the beginning, Amit that my desire was not there. So nothing changed drastically. If I was at eight years, a certain mindset, which is low attention span, doing whatever's going on on a daily basis. This is exactly how I live today. There was this eight years in corporate life, that I was a little bit different because it was a nine to nine routine. After that, I got back to my childhood. So the transition of going into a corporate job was the only aberration for eight years. After that, I'm back because I'm a freelancer. And for me, I've realized that do little, get more output. If you can crack that I have enough and more time for me. So honestly, I can't answer this question because I have no thoughts I have, I've remained exactly the same."

But nevertheless, you have some desires, which is why you kind of have the kind of career that you've had, even if you didn't actively plan it out or chase it that way. So was it just like a series of what was your sort of philosophy and looking back philosophy, looking back, but not thinking about it or framing it that way?

And I remember most of the postings, we were in Bareilly and Jamnagar. And then the best posting we ever had was the National Defense Academy. And that's where I realized that I do not want to join the armed forces because it was a beautiful resort, but you don't want to be part of it from the active level. And service officers children have always two options, right? Either you get inspired ki hamare pardada bhi army mein hua karte the types or second is bhai apne bas ki baat nahi hai. And that happened to me in the National Defense Academy. My dad was, you know, we were on a scooter and the NDA cadets while they are, you know, going on a cycle next to you, if they see a senior officer or wife, you're supposed to stretch your arms like this on the cycle, which means that respect diya aapko. Toh we were there and my dad's coursemate, he was also driving and then suddenly he realized that this yeh cadet ne aise haath nahi kiya tha, stretch nahi kiya tha. And he stopped the cadet and asked him, what's your name? So I don't remember the cadet's name. So it's say, for example, Roshan Abbas. So R-O-S-H aise front roll sabke saamne karnega. And that when I saw, I realized bhai, my dad would start doing this at home. So I'm not going to join the National Defense Academy, but the good news was because you are an Air Force officer's son, you play golf at a young age, you get exposed to, there's so many cricket grounds there, football grounds. So my love for sports started at the National Defense Academy. The good news was that some 25 years later, I performed for the 117th course there. And I told my father, without doing all this effort, see, I'm addressing the entire academy in front of the admiral of the Indian Navy. So that's how my childhood was going from one Air Force station to the other. And then one fine day, my parents said ki yaar isko thoda stabilize karke. So we came to Pune. Now, Pune at that point of time was, means, you know, Gokhale, Ranade, Agarkar, that was the background and Gokhale Institute. I know Amit had an interface with that institute. So it was an amazing cosmopolitan world in the armed forces to hardcore Puneri. And I loved it because in the armed forces, you're not exposed to art in that form, right? Everybody, NDA cadets also do a great job when it comes to theater, music and all of that. But when I came to Pune, I realized that there was this new world, which I loved, which is, you know, getting exposed to going for Sawai Gandharva at six in the morning. And my mother shifted with me to make sure my education was good. So I was in Karnataka High School. I got introduced to Pula Deshpande, who I believe is the greatest living legend across the world because nobody is an actor, writer, director, harmonium player, music composer, plus Ran Doordarshan for such a long time and an orator. It's a disrespect to call him a comedian. So from that perspective, Indian classical music and my introduction to cricket, I started playing at PYC. And that's where I realized that I had a lot of cricket in me mentally, but not physically, because that was the generation of Sachin Tendulkar, unfortunately for us. And that's the reason I wrote this book, How Sachin Destroyed My Life, which we'll talk about it later. And I started playing and I realized that I had a good hand-eye coordination. I was doing well. The music was going well. I started playing the tabla. So then once I settled in Pune, I got exposed to this world and I was in Narayan Ped, hardcore Peshwa territory, where music and arts was flowing. Experimental theater was in a big way there. And then post that, I joined Ferguson College where I met Amit Verma."

And he said that one of the reasons I can probably analyze the game better is because I was not good enough. And I think he did not say it in these words, but this is what I interpreted, because this was a conversation I had with him about Sachin Tendulkar. And he said that many a time Sachin Tendulkar did not realize that he was too good to know that there are other people who may not be as good enough. And therefore you have to plan for them as well. And I realized that my understanding of the environment was better from probably a writer's perspective is because I could not play the on drive as good as the other guy. Sometimes as artists, as sports people, we do things naturally. And this is a conversation again with Sachin Tendulkar. And I asked him that, how did you motivate yourself?

But whoever has excellence, if he goes there and stays in the pond, and that is the only reason after Ferguson College, when we had no idea about, you know, post-grad, what to do, I was playing cricket. I realized that, you know, my coach had told me that you've got to get at least 300 in that season to even come to a point where you will compete with the Mumbai guys, because the Mumbai guys were making 2-2,000 runs a season. Even Maharashtra had a fabulous team at that point of time in Ranji Trophy. So then I realized that, boss, this is not good enough, so I will have to prepare for MBA, because MBA was graduation by that time. You will get a job worth 8-10,000. And thankfully, I had a good set of friends, and I always believe that, boss, 5 business relationships and 5 friends is what you need to survive in life, because you don't have a bandwidth on this. I don't have it. After that, you have acquaintances, whom you develop for business, that yes, I will get business from this. But 5 friends and 5 business, and I believe that also has Pareto's principle. If you look back at Roshan's career, probably there are 5 clients that made his last company, Encompass. There were a lot of small companies which kind of propelled the 50 lakh, whatever, small small business, but the big guys like what? The Asian Pay. The Asian Pay. Amit Singles. Amit Singles of the world, exactly. And that applies to life as well, that those 5 relationships, if you develop all your life in business and in this thing, and this is something that I kept with. And I said that these are my 4-5 friends, this is what we have to do, we have to stay in the zone, that boss, I like cricket. And then, that is where I think I interacted with Harsha Bhokle for the first time. And I said that yeah, this is an interesting space. Again, not because I want to become a commentator and all, but this is a good space. So I was always looking at spaces, that I want to swim in this pond, I want to swim in this pond, I want to become one or not, I didn't know, because as I said, I was living those moments at that time. And then my friends gathered together and said that, you know, see again those 5 friends came to me and said, let's study from you, you crack the MBA entrance exam later. You will not believe, there was the MBA entrance exam and I was not motivated to go for the exam, because I didn't know what I will do with finance and marketing and sales. There were guys who came to my house, picked me up, took me to the place where the, you know, they had taken my study, you know, I had taken all the preparation for 15 days. And one of these guys, Sunil Fatak, who is now in the Bay Area, he knew the system inside out, which questions will come. So he told me that also and I got my MBA entrance and it was a premier college. So then I had to do my MBA. There was no option. But by that time, I realized that media is probably a space I need to go to. And thankfully, all these friends, my cricket friends gathered and said, okay, you know, we will find a way out somewhere to get a career. And guess what, I had done BSc in Geology. You did a BSc in Geology? Yeah, before that, because what happened was after 12th, everybody was engineering, engineering, so I applied for polymer engineering. And again, my mamaji, this is a funny story, my mama came to me and said that, you know, I don't think it's a good idea, because I have repented. I don't want you to repent. So, and I love my mamaji because he was the one who said that, boss, don't do anything. Everybody in the family, intellectually oriented, you should do this, you should do that, up the benchmark. I didn't have that concept. So the story is that in BSc, I got 5 out of 100 in Chemistry. So there was a parent-teacher meeting and my mamaji went to meet the chemistry professor. And I was like, I was really scared, what will he come and stuff like that. I was outside waiting, what will happen, what will happen, what will happen. And I lied to them saying that my parents are out of town. And I told mama that please go on behalf of the parents. So he had also said, okay, I will handle this. And he came out of that parent-teacher meeting, and he hugged me. So I said, why is he hugging me 5 out of 100, it's embarrassing. He said, the one before you had 3 out of 100. I'm proud of you. So that is the relationship I had with my"

So there was BSc, which is the most disastrous course in the history of mankind. Because you neither here nor there. You don't have the capacity for R&D. So basically, you have to do BSc. Then in BSc, physics, chemistry, the problem was nothing mattered. So can't study matter. So then geology is now, when I look back, geology was a very interesting subject. But at that time, what to see inside the rock, inside the mineral, but finally I did that. And I remember my grandmother introducing me, typical Marathi family people coming home and said, what has your grandson? Ordinary BSc. How can you introduce me? Ordinary. Ordinary BSc. For her, it meant that his career is over, he has done ordinary BSc. And there was this look on her face that it's over. So in Pune, you could not have done BSc, it was a complete failure. But thankfully, in that process, I realized that even with MBA, I should not be doing the standard stuff. And that's why when I came to campus, I was one of the toppers and I did not get the companies that I wanted. Coke and Hindustan Lever at that point of time, my CV was shortlisted. And I decided I will go on my own. And guess what? I went to Mumbai in 1997. And I started a wrestling company."

So obviously, watching the movie, I thought that this is a new problem, right? Everybody is watching English Premier League. And now every kid in urban India believes that he is going to take the football coach's job at Manchester United or Arsenal. And so I get a call every week from some friend's son who's saying, uncle, I want to be in football. So then suddenly I'll hear, why? You know, I want to do something because we lost. I said, who lost? Puddar College? No, he said, Arsenal. So look at the construct of patriotism now. Where does patriotism come from? You know, you play for your college. I played for PYC, I played for Ferguson, I was patriotic. Now this fellow in Ghatkopar is patriotic about Chelsea. And he wants to be the manager there. But that happened to me. That happened to me and I wanted to head IMG, Mark McCormack, because he, you know, ran all the businesses, business of sport. And that's what drove me to Mumbai. And that point of time Premchand Degra had become Mr. Universe. You know, not wrestling as such, but it was bodybuilding, which went to wrestling and Arnold Schwarzenegger's book I had read at that point of time, along with Dorian Yates, was the bodybuilder's supreme. And one of my friends came to me that, I want to bring Mr. Universe to Mumbai. I said, super idea. So then we contacted Mr. Universe, the franchisee, and they said that, you know, we look at you. So I met at that time, instead of doing your summer training or whatever, I met the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. And I told him that was Narayan Rane. I said, I want to bring Mr. Universe. He said, what do you want to bring? Bring him. As if I was getting some like, you know, some guy's invitation to come in a plane. But that kind of, you know, but that six months was very important because I realized at that time that the sports business is not to do with actually organizing sports. It was about television. And for me, it was important that, you know, to join television to understand the sporting business. And that's where, you know, we, the MTB offer happened.

Amit\u2026 Amit Khanna. Amit Khanna, Mahesh Bhatt. Amit Khanna, Mahesh Bhatt. And there was this movie they had done called Papa Kehte Hain, whose soundtrack was excellent, actually.

So what happened during the time when I was playing cricket, I had befriended Samir Dige. Samir Dige was then Mumbai captain and he played for Mumbai with Sachin and the whole amazing gang, Nilesh Kulkarni, Paras Mamre, Salil Ankola. The story that Salil Ankola, every time I meet him even today, I'm scared of him because a ball that was pitch short, I still have the bruise in my chest because he was very, very quick at that point of time, very strong lad. And yeah, so Samir Dige, I knew and I called him and I said that, you know, I started this company and all. And I don't know what to do, but I want to be in cricket. So he introduced me to Hemant Kinkre. Hemant Kinkre is Sunil Gavaskar's cousin. And he was earlier married to Asha Bhusle's daughter. Fabulous cricketer, good batsman for CCI. He said that, you know, I'll introduce you to Mr. Gavaskar and Sumedh Shah, who ran professional management group, which was the only company at that point of time, which kind of resembled, you know, this cricketing world and management kind of a world. I met Harsha that time and I met Harsha and told him that, you know, I want to be in this space. He said, you work in PMG. I also worked there years back. So you'll get some basic exposure there. But it was a year's stint with that's where I started imitating Sunil Gavaskar. And, you know, I used to do this in front of Vaishali Hotel.

And one of them is very interesting where you, you know, you speak about how when you were playing cricket, it was obvious to you that you're not, you know, going to be at that level. And I remember, I retired from chess as a 19 year old in the early 90s, when I kind of came to the same realization. So, you know, what is the point? And also in the particular club where I played, which was a fatke club in Pune in the early 90s, there were these couple of kids who were really good, much better than me. So I thought, okay, kids here are beating me, what's the chance outside? Then one became a grandmaster, one became a master. So, you know, I shouldn't have been too hard on myself. But the thing here is that in sport, you know, when you're not good, because you're getting that instant feedback, ki, you know, Salil Ankula ne bol ki, ribs pe laga, abhi, you know, I can't walk properly for two days. But in art, that feedback loop isn't there. And therefore, what happens is that a lot of people who get into the arts, whether they are singing or writing or whatever, they think they are much better than they are. Now, there are two sides to this. And the negative side is you can waste a lot of time doing something you're not cut out for, because you don't have the self awareness. But the positive side is that you don't know that you suck, because everybody sucks at the start, whenever they do something, you don't know that you suck. So you continue. And just the sheer hard work that you then put in and the sheer repetition actually makes you good at it. Basically, you fake it till you make it. Like when I think of myself as a writer in my 20s, my writing was shit, and I didn't have the judgment to know it. So you know, I, you know, I wrote bad things, I thought I was a cat's whiskers. But it's a good thing because I you know, that self delusion just kind of keeps you going. So these seem to me to be two very different ways in which it plays out that in sport, you know exactly where you are. And you know, the work you need to do to get ahead. And that's got his good and bad aspects. And the good aspect of that is you can work hard and get there. And the bad aspect of that is that you can get disheartened, maybe you could have been something good, but you don't put in the work. Whereas in the arts, again, there's the same thing, you don't know that feedback loop is in there. And it can work in both good and bad ways."

And in that under 15 game in Mumbai, when I saw Tendulkar play, when I saw Vinod play, and while we were grafting, you know, scoring, say 25 runs in 40 balls, and we thought the conditions were difficult. And here was a guy who had scored 120 not out in the first, you know, first one or one and a half, two hours, and he left that match and went to Thane and scored another 100 runs. So the benchmark was like, so high, that you were like, you're not even in the play 11, boss, you should not be playing this game. So the metric is very, very clear. In art, there is a very complex problem, right? Because art, you don't know what the metric is, you also work on conviction. And everybody tells you that, boss, like, you know, as a filmmaker, also Roshan would tell you that many a times I've seen and I worked in the movie industry for a couple of years as well, that what is the line where you say, boss, mere creative ko as a director, I trust.

No, I have a slight disagreement on this, which is the fact of saying that, you know, when you when you work in the creative and saying that, you know, you don't know whether you're good or you're bad or whatever, not true. What happens is, if you make your art incestuous, if you only listen to either yourself or a few people who may be yes or yes people around you, you're, you know, you can be in that loop of never knowing how you are. But if you put your art to test, I can be using my cricket bat sitting inside my room and constantly practicing, you know, what some stroke or the other, but till I don't go out and actually do it, you will never get to know. In art, I mean, and personally, I'll tell you this, that when I moved from Lucknow to Delhi, and when I first went out and said, I can think I'm a great debater, or I can take part in the debate. If I lose every debate in the world, then obviously I'm not a good debater. I can get on to radio, which is what I did next or whatever and stuff. And, you know, if I'm not moved into A grade recording artist within three months, so, you know, I actually always set these little targets for myself. Okay, boss, now this TV anchoring is going on. I remember at that time with Oprah, there used to be this other, there was this male, Phil Donahue. And Donahue used to do an interview. And one of Donahue's articles turned and said that a great career if you're on TV, is that if you're lucky, you'll get 10 years. If you're great, you might get so if you're lucky, you'll get five, if you're great, you'll get 10. And if you're God, you might end up getting more. So, you know, so immediately when I 25, I did television, I said, boss, 35, but this ain't going to end. It might not be God, but I'll manage. So I said 10 years. So I said that as a target, you know, and I sometimes feel this that if you don't, I was at Edinburgh, you know, in August, you're not just doing your show, you're on the road selling your show, you're standing out there every day and saying, come see my show, come see my show and the number of people who come to your show, then are the people who will go and tell the next set of people. So, you know, the problem is this that very often when you get incestuous about, I remember Public Demand was a show I used to do, I used to go out on the road, shoot every day and whatever. One day we got lazy. We had a segment left. And because we used to be produced by TV18 in those days, there were a bunch of TV18 interns standing outside. So the cameraman and my director said, let's shoot here. And we shot with all of those people, got fabulous bites. And it went into the episode. Raghav Bahl, who was the head of TV18, along with Rishi, was the creative director, used to put up these things on the wall as a review. And I still remember he put up this review and he said, I saw the latest episode of Public Demand, love this, this, this, this. And by the way, that last segment is being shot with our people. If you become so incestuous with your production, you will, if it is meant to be Public Demand, where's the public? You know, and it really struck home for me saying that if you don't keep testing that boundary, I worked with Vikram for years on end, right? I have seen him test that boundary. The first time it was just an impression of X, then it became X plus Y. Then he heard a bunch of us doing singing act. He never used to do a singing act before. He heard it and he said, I can do better than you. And he added that. Then he saw there was, you know, I mean, I've actually tracked him through this all because I've done it so well. But I've seen him do that. He's challenged every boundary, tested it, whatever didn't work, he dropped it. You're conscious of your art. You know, this conceit of art that happens sometimes, you get stuck in that. So I keep saying, my only thing is, I'm saying, whatever you do, keep testing. If you were not able to make money from the podcast today, Amit, with all the circles you created around it, at some point in time, you turn and say, either I'm doing it for myself or I'll leave it.

With art, the problem is that there are two different kinds of metrics, right? And one is the metric of just immediate popularity, that you're getting the talis now, you're getting the numbers now, and that is one kind of metric and you do what and you you know, you focus on that and you do whatever it takes to get you there. The other is a metric where you are really sort of not catering to that mass, where you're saying ki mujhe niche pakarna hai ya mujhe niche banana hai from scratch, there's no niche there, but I will make it, you know, people who have a certain sensibility who will appreciate what you do, where you say that those numbers don't matter. And therefore, the metric of mass popularity doesn't matter. And you're catering to something else, which at that moment is invisible. Like, for example, if I had to go by the mass popularity method by what I the feedback I was getting through the feedbacks loop I had, everybody would have said do one hour episodes. In fact, initially do 20 minute episodes, you know, the point that I do the long episodes that I do is because I stuck to saying that I will do what I want to do.

Jab se main youth tha abhi tak, the only question in marketing conferences, what does the youth want?

And the problem is your first creative work is what you feel. And unfortunately, most creative work after that is what people want. When you turn into a marketer from a creative and very few creative people are able to maintain that integrity, probably because they've got success in a big way in the initial phase of their career because of the original stuff that they created, that they can afford to follow their creative field. The moment you go that, you know, my market research tells me that 15 to 24 require this kind of humor. And I think that the point that you make there is very critical is that how does a creative person figure this challenge out? And that challenge for a creative remains forever."

We'll occasionally have those conversations, right? And I think building this virtuous circle around you is an important thing. The second thing which is really important is, I think is, a great cricketer should be able to play all three formats, true or not true? Not true because it's a different sport. Exactly, right? Now, that's what I'm saying. So, is he not a great cricketer? If he didn't serve, no. So, is it a matter of conviction or is it a matter of choice? So, I'm just saying that he knows how to play cricket. He's playing very well in the test. One couldn't play. He didn't play T20. He's playing T20 very well. The other one couldn't play.

You know, if you don't do it, where will you see that new world? If Amit hadn't started clear writing, I mean, I'm still dying to see your TikTok course, which we were doing on WhatsApp. Because I want to know what was your view on it. Even today, when I'm in Dubai on another phone, I'm watching TikTok because I want to know what is that short form format? Is there anything I could do there? Should I do it? Not for money. The minute commerce enters the equation is very different. Just for the second, I mean, I was doing this play. What was it? It was just testing. Can I do it? It's completely different. It's a mad challenge. I won't get the money. It's a theater, but it's a learning process. And he does the same. You do the same. Commerce lens, for Satya, it's not a commerce lens because for him, it's a thing. I could have slept for so long."

And I would like to believe that in the past during, even in Bollywood, if you say the, you know, time when Raj Kapoor and, you know, your metric of failure was only box office. People didn't, it was not like the social media technology changed the game completely because now you are getting negative feedback from people who have no understanding. They've not even seen your work. And that's a problem because today, if Raj Kapoor made a bad film or, you know, Prithviraj Kapoor did some bad play or whatever. It wasn't fun. That's all the feedback we used to get. Today, the problem is that the creative is afraid to cross the creative boundary. Because he's saying, no, this is on social media. These people curse. I'll make a meme of this type, that will work better. And I think the biggest challenge, the good thing about technology, we discovered more creative people. That was the good thing.

The point is, the only thing that makes you unique among the 7 billion people on the planet is you. So you just be authentic to yourself and do what you have to do. Now, the thing with feedback loops also is that they take a long period of time. Like honestly, Roshan, even with my podcast first three or four years, even, I had no idea that I was doing something which was really valued by people. It was just, you know, I liked it, I kept doing it, I got some feedback, I felt good. It was only after COVID when I said, okay, whoever wants to, you know, contribute financially to the show, you can do so, open that page. Suddenly, month one, I was like, like, what is happening, you know, that's when I kind of realized. And then with the clear writing course, when people signed up, that's when I kind of began to interface with those people and realized that it means so much to so many people. But otherwise, it is a completely dispersed thing. And I have no idea. But once I know, then I can double down on the things that I find of value in it. And what you're saying what creators Vikram is so true, because if you are chasing the numbers, everybody is going to the lowest common denominator. And secondly, today, we are in a space where AI is going to do that way better than us. You know, if you look at and friends, abhi toh GPT 3.5 chal raha hai, but GPT 4, some friends of mine have seen it in private, and they are raving about it. They're saying it's mad. And, you know, we are recording this at the start of December, but what we so even the GPT we see today is not at the level it will, you know, it's going to just exponentially get better.

And I said, you know, you have to understand that every sport has a different audience. And just because something is 10,000 crores doesn't mean 50 crore is bad. A small scale company doesn't, you know, just because Reliance is a big company doesn't mean a bearings manufacturer in Pune is bad. He has his own space, Reliance has his own space, so you're saying that everybody has to become a big company. There won't be any space for MSMEs. Similarly, there is a chess market, but you have to think whether you are at the top of that chess market or not.

If we are going to play Khokho or we are going to play Atta Patta or we are going to try to make these, you know, sports that have been there in India for a while successful, why are we looking at cricket? Let's make a successful 5 crore enterprise. Let's make that sport, you know, successful in that particular segment and therefore get the economics right in that segment.

So I remembered the second point I wanted to make with the thousand two fans point, which was that I did an episode with Vinay Singhal. Right now, Vinay Singhal is one guy who said, I won't follow the trend. He started this company called Stage. Have you heard of? Yeah. So what Stage decided was that we will be an OTT for Bharat, but not an OTT for Bharat in terms of Hindi, Punjabi, in these major languages, but for the dialects. Now, I had always thought that, you know, that with urbanization and the forces of capitalism and people going for scale, that there's going to be a certain homogenization, that you grow up in a Haryana village, you have a particular dialect, you go to a city, but then your incentives are to learn the languages of the city, which could be Hindi, if it's a north city, or it could be English, and gradually dialects die. And Vinay's narrative has a lot of this happening in the first part of his life, where he is embarrassed of his dialect, he speaks about a struggle learning English, and then he speaks about a struggle learning Hindi, you know, and so but he started an OTT for dialects like Haryanvi, Bhojpuri and Rajasthani, I think are the three that they have now. And that's worked remarkably well, they've got a lakh and a half subscribers at Netflix rates. And I see a movement towards the opposite direction now, again, fueled by capitalism, but also with the aid of technology, which is empowering individual creators, where a creator can today go out there and say, okay, I am Haryanvi, I talk like this, but I'm proud of it, I'm going to own it, you know, I'm not going to try to fit in, I don't care where the large market is, I will own it. And those markets are now taking shape, like when I spoke about this reverse migration from Bollywood, that earlier Haryanvi kids used to come to Bombay, to work in Bollywood, and today they are going back. And I find this very interesting, because what this means, to me, is a semi permanent shift away from the mainstream being everything, there will still be a mainstream, but it will no longer be everything, that people will also have their own ecosystems where, you know, but there'll be dispersed audiences, there'll be whatever, but they can form the like, I have my little ecosystems, which I as a consumer, which I keep dipping into, like including chess, for example, which you guys might not even know are there, and it doesn't matter.

I'm currently working with two startups, where these guys are doing dubbing, which is going to sync. So first, it will take any dialect, as long as the AI has got the ability to translate that, right? So from audio to text, then it'll take the text, translate it into another language. It'll contextualize with a human individual to see whether that is working. And then it's going to lay it back in another emotional voice. Now, imagine what will happen to content then.

Where you said that what you need to get ahead in life is to have 5 friends, 5 business contacts, and you get by. And what I was thinking about that is that one, I sort of agree with the importance of friends. So I have realized late in life that one has to be intentional. Like I've lost touch with so many people. Same laziness. Who's going to make the effort? I'll have to write an email. Why? You know, he remembers me. So but now I try to make more of an effort to, you know, stay in touch with friends and all of that. But I am wondering about the role of intentionality in this. Like even in whatever little career I had, you know, I was never a person who wanted to go out networking. That meet people and hand out a visiting card in the age where visiting cards existed and do all of that. That just wasn't for me. I was like, if I like talking to you, I'll talk to you. Otherwise, you know, I'm not going to make the effort. But how important is intentionality to this? Because it's one thing to say that these are the friends who help me and these are the people who help my business. So, you know, it's one thing to come at it post-facto. And it's another to say that I need to cultivate friends. I need to stay in touch with my five friends. I need to stay in touch with, you know, I need to make business contacts. Because I don't know when they will come in handy. And that second attitude is very difficult for me. Though in the context of friends, I'm trying to do it. In the context of business, my mind just doesn't think like that. So, how much is that intentionality important?"

Let your work speak for itself. It's not important to market yourself. This is where I come from. So, even I thought that intentionally making friends with someone, this means that you're taking work out of me, this is not the right lens you should go. And I continued with this thought for a long time. So, whatever 4-5 friends I had, they were natural friends. It was fun to spend time with them in Vaishali. And it automatically happened that I invested in them. There was no intentionality. But then I met a very interesting guy who's a very close friend of mine. Whose name is Sunandan Lele. And he's somebody, you know, one of the most eminent cricket journalists that has been in our part of the world. Most importantly, he's somebody who is what I call Jag Mitra. He has close to 5000 friends across the world. There is no cricketer who's not his best friend. And I used to go on tours. I started touring since 2002-2003. Up until Tendulkar retired actively in 2013. And then 3-4 years and then I stopped touring. And I was like amazed by this guy."

The first tour I did with him in South Africa, the driver who came to pick us up at Johannesburg airport, 20 years later, he is the same guy who comes and picks him up. Why? Because Sunandan took a small purse for his wife from Tulsi Bagh, Pune. What would be in it? He said, human relationship is the only reason we should exist on this planet. And therefore, whether it is Tendulkar Kohli, if at all Virat Kohli talks to anybody in the journalism fraternity, it's Sunandan Lele. Because Sunandan Lele believes that a gift is a thought transfer that happens from one person to another. It is not that I came to you with a bottle of wine. If you haven't thought about it, and you haven't brought the correct gift for it, then your gift has no value. These are the values that he taught me. What a great perspective.

And even today, if you go to any part of the world, whether it is the West Indies, whether it is Australia, the only person who's the best friend of John Bradman is Sunandan Lele. John Bradman does not associate with anybody because of the baggage of being Donald Bradman's son. But every tour, he will come and meet Sunandan at Melbourne or Sydney or whatever and say that, Mr. Lele, you are the man of this world. And that I used to see and say, wow, man, wow. Even Tendulkar today would call Sunandan and say that I am doing this. Do you think this is right? He has most advisors because the trust, amount of charity work that I did with Sunandan, because he said that, boss, this is your duty to help others because you are one of the 0.1% of the humanity who is talking about cricket and you are getting paid to joke. So that when I saw and then I realized that, yes, boss, it's about relationships and you should not be awkward. On the contrary, it should be part of your checklist on a daily basis.

I think it's been the defining part of what I have been all my life because these guys know that I am number one a problem solver. So if you give it to me, I will solve it. I must solve it. I'll try my best to solve it if I can. And I try to solve it. And this is my parents that I'm not doing it with my Kaploo fitting. What will I get is not at all important. So I think that is something which has worked for me. I remember when I had gone to the first ThinkFest or whatever, etc. After two days of great conversation or whatever, we had only met. And I said, man, after this, there should be a DoFest. Because everyone thinks, talks a lot, dreams are discussed a lot. Even dogs think. And finally implementing it, because I somehow find that this ability or just this bias to action, to do things, right? I mean, to make this recording happen, to push for this conversation. It makes all of us richer, right? I mean, I'm getting to know parts of society that I don't know. And I'm like, wow. I didn't know this. I didn't know about your chess. So these are discoveries that you will make. I'm sorry, I'm going back to something which I did very recently. But I'm not a professional actor. It's been a hobby. I've been more, I used to act. And then suddenly because I started writing and directing, in every play I used to do, I would do a little walk-on. Because it was fun and people used to enjoy it. And they knew me as a face on television. So it used to add some value. But I genuinely wasn't acting to a thing. I finished Aladdin 2018. I did that also at that point because a bunch of my friends said, listen, just do it. I mean, what are you scared of? And I knew that I was a little scared of dancing on stage. Singing, I'm not scared of. Acting, I'm not scared of. But again, I was doing it for a month. I got tons of offers for acting after that. And every time I would do a couple of auditions. Tess Joseph is a very dear friend of mine. Wonderful casting director. And she somehow has this big belief in me as an actor. And she keeps calling me for wonderful films. I on two occasions even got the roles. And then the dates didn't match. When suddenly this play happened to me in September and whatever, you know. And out of the blue, Dilip Shankar who was casting, who I was asking for help in my film in 2011. Suddenly reaches out and says, listen, I've got a reverse thing for you. Which is will you read for Lalit. And Lalit Verma in Monsoon Wedding. And I had remembered the film. And I said, for me the first thing was Naseer Saab Ka Role. So, you know, that thing that you say, the thick and thin desire. So suddenly this thing, oh my God, I'll get to do that role. I worked my butt off. Did the audition. Was very scared. For one week I was like, oh my God, but it's a song. The one song I heard was very classical. I said, I won't be able to get a note. I actually thought of satay at that time. Saying, I'll sing this. I don't know if I'll be able to sing it or not. You know, it's a scale or not. I said, I'll get it. You know, three months. We did 12 shows in Doha. There was a very good audience. Some people globally saw it. Whatever, the play will travel internationally. It will become big. But what I learnt from the people around me. You know, and not, see I could also go there. Amit, every morning. Do my lines. Sit in a corner. Have my assistant with me. Give me my cup of coffee. Go into my room. No. There was this girl, Sharwari Deshpande. Who was acting opposite me. Brilliant actress. And I just said. I said, you know, you're present in every scene. I'm not. My mind is racing on a hundred things. How do you do it? She told me. You know, I studied this in my masters in theatre. Why don't you do this? I took three books. Now I'm studying something on perspectives in theatre. I'm studying something on breathing. Right. It's giving me something. I have a 30 year old music director. Who I think is a genius. Never got flapped. Emily Whittaker, 30 years old. Standing there and just playing the music. And we had one song changed a day before the play. Day before the play. Because some rights issues happened. And this girl is sitting there. Figuring out. With the entire orchestra in two hours. And then you sit and say. But where do you do this? Or where does. But if one intention is to work. The other intention is to invest in people. People don't invest in people that often. I feel that if you invest in people. And Sathe knows this. I will chase him down. And follow. And he is in Pune. And he is there. And whatever. And I know. Because I understand the kind of person. I also. Like for example. I realize that you. You have a small set of people. Who you like to meet. Or whatever. But I'll be. Looking forward to meeting the people of immemorial susceptibility. Let's like. Because investing in people. It can't be a bigger investment in the world. Which you. I am telling you. Everything you are telling about Sundar Lele. I was thinking that people. What kind of thing. And I in fact. Sometimes. What I was scared. I have to keep some nicknacks together. My book's copy. Copy a little ego was achieved. So I said no, let's stop it. But just doing that paying that compliment. The members of the purse. At our hotel reception in Doha. I just went the first day, I said, why don't you come and see our play? Oh, you're doing play? I said, yeah. Oh, I would like to come, but what about tickets and what have you said? We said, yeah, there are always some seats. We'll get it organized. So the guy came, and he waited after the play. And I swear, I had tears in my eyes because when I came out, this boy, the way he hugged us, everyone, oh, my God, you're all our stars. Then he told his own story, told his own song. Now a friend has become Doha, who used to provide me almond milk in the morning for breakfast"

Then he would go and say, what food will you serve them? Don't serve me a special meal. What's your regular meal? And if he could, he would try and go without actually telling them he's coming. But he said, these are the two things that matter when you're out of your house. Ultimately, in which bed do you sleep, what do you eat? He says, the event is for two hours, four hours, you can make a spectacle out of it. 20 dancing people will come, there will be lights, there will be sound, there will be motivational speaker. Ultimately, that guy will go to that bed to sleep. And that meal that he will eat.

So basically, every time you have to understand, and this is Roshan's plus and it's his minus, is because the moment you become an entrepreneur, and I've seen this in many YPO events that I perform at, where there are millionaires and trillionaires, see your lens becomes entrepreneurial. And that sometimes is good, that sometimes is bad, because you are looking at return on investment on everything. And you have to be wired like that to become a good entrepreneur. So the moment the entrepreneur realizes that this is a place of value, his checklist will have that. And which is a good thing. I'm not saying that. So it is now second nature to invest in people. Now it starts with warmth, but anything that you want to excel in has to be routinized. And that's what atomic habits is all about, for that matter. That is what sport teaches you. It's about doing the same things again and again. And that's why if you see Dhoni coming and taking strike, he will, you know, wipe his brow first, then he'll do this and that, because to come to a point of extreme concentration and effectiveness, a routine is what takes you to that point. So many people, you know, ask me, when you're imitating Sachin Tendulkar, why are you doing that? I have had a conversation with Sachin and said that if I don't make my cup of tea in the morning, till the point of time I'm taking strike, everything is the same, because that brings me to that state of consciousness where I'm facing somebody at 140 and trying to see whether the ball is reversing or going the other way. So that routine is what defines excellence. And I think with Roshan, I've seen that, that when he knows that, boss, I'm going to be useful in business, I'm going to be useful in personal relationships, I'll routinize it. And that's why it's become second nature to him. With Sunandan also, I have seen that he will not go to anybody's house without taking that small thing. And if you've said in one of the conversations that I have that saffron biryani, that's it, it's in his database. Now, if he goes to Iran, then Amit, I've brought your saffron. Now, the thing is, that's coming naturally to him now, but he realizes the significance"

My mother had this line which we used to always call her Kalyari Devi, because taking care of the whole neighborhood, right, from the maid to that person, the ironing woman, the sweeper. This is her problem. Even today, my mother, now we have a, after years, we have a live-in, you know, a help with a husband who drinks, he's nice at heart, but sometimes he drinks, whatever, that's the thing. But his two children, like they are my mother's project right now. Covering their books and all that is their project. Now, the children said to him, they came home and they said, Nani, you come to our science fair. You know, my father, who doesn't step out, went with such pride. And I said that look at what it does, it gives them a reason to be, because we all need finally that reason to be. For me, I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I have this with me. Just to his saffron biryani story, I'll tell you, I love, I'm curious, I love discovering things. One day I discovered a place where, when somebody told me that the place called Love Fools that does this incredible sit-down dinners in Bandra, I went there for the first time, to test it myself, because I won't introduce my friend that I've tested, you know, properly there. Beautiful, lovely meal and whatever, loved it and stuff. Talked to Sarita Pereira, who was the chef, asked her life story. Now, nobody, people just appreciate the food. I sat with her for half an hour and I asked her, where did you come from? I was in Spain, I learnt here, I did this, da-da-da-da-da, whatever. I went to Turkey. I'm going to Turkey through the market and suddenly I remember that she had mentioned to me that many of the spices I used to use in my food, I can't find. And I just messaged her saying, Sarita, I'm in Turkey, I'm in the spices market, I was thinking of you, anything I can get for you. What when I was in Doha, the message I sent, I just sent you that, nothing. I just suddenly said, Amit, are you fond of football, whatever, whatever, so it's that thing. And in that, there's no, it wasn't a matter of profit. She said, I can get a pepper called Urf Biber, but I can't find it. I went, I took a box with me, when did you get Urf Biber? Love Fools is now one of the best known private dining experiences in Bombay. There are days you can't get a seat or whatever. I can get anything, anytime. But because, and but it's not just that. I will continue the relationship. Sarita will call me, I'm thinking of opening a speakeasy on top, we'll commune, come and do something. You know, this, you have to participate without this thing of, will I fit Papplu in this?"

Now, if you are born from this lens, so then what happens is that, oh man, the whole world has gone because of merchants. We have to fit Papplu and bring Columbus there, otherwise why would he have to go there? But we have to accept that as long as we are seeing win-win, as they say in Sapolsky's book, this research shows that when two people win, the dopamine production is also high. The double thank you moment. Effectively. So this means that somewhere we have to accept that if we make friends in trade, it's fine. There is nothing wrong in this. You are making friends, not enemies. So I think fitting Papplu has to be acceptable now in order to create."

And when I was watching this, I said, yaar kya camaraderie hai, you know, between the two actors. And he said, I'm giving you this guy's number, you call him after half an hour. The other actor went off. This actor who owned the vehicle, called that guy and said, sunn, main tere ke liye so and so bhej raha hoon, mera 10% rakh liye na. Wow. You know, mere saamne se saara veneer hat gaya, dosti, ye bandhan toh pyaar ka bandhan hai. And I said, okay. But I will never do that.

I did the musical. I discovered that India doesn't have a musical company culture. So in America, there is a company theater thing where there'll be a company and the company will be paid for and they're rehearsing every day, which is why they can put up a musical every year. In India, we recruit what we call triple threats. Triple threats are, you can act, sing and dance. So that's a triple threat as a performer, right? And a triple threat performer is very rare to find. In Disney in the West, how do you get all these big actors? Because they start from summer camps. Now, for me, there's a problem to solve. If you want, there are eight big musicals happening in India. Believe you me, six of them are going to be disasters. Because you are trying to hum Bollywood film musical, but, you know, are you training the actors? Are you training that base talent? You will get by because you will pre-record the songs and therefore they'll lip sync. Then it's not a true musical, right? You will do it because you got pre-recorded music and not live musicians, then it is not a musical. So to preserve that form, you need to develop this. Now I found a creative problem to solve. How do you set up a musical theatre company? So I went to my community, I said, guys, I think we should, we do, we do workshops and this, this and this. Why can't we do this? Now I will solve that. This is saying trying to find a problem, trying to find a business solution for it and see if it is implemented. If it happens only once, it was a creative act of passion. If it is finds repeat business, it's a business, right? If it can be repeated, that's one part. But jumping in and doing crazy things like going and doing this play or suddenly going and doing a writing work, I mean, when I did the writing workshop with you, it was what? I have never done it. Let's do it once and see what happens. I attended Satyanshu's lectures on filmmaking because I really thought his, and today Satyanshu is a friend, we are working on something together. That was not the intention from day one. The intention was to learn. The intention was to do something crazy and new. Satyanshu does the same, but he does it in a pace of doing that now comedy is happening. It is happening. It is happening. But it reached a point where I'm telling you, he got, I told him this when he got pissed off because everybody would call him a comic, but his logic was, boss, that's a lot of intelligence and really there is. Some of his observations in shows, my God, that's a life truth. It's not comedy. Zakir today with Tathastu, everybody is going nuts. Yeah, it's life truths, which is just captured in a format. So Satya said, no, to prove that I am much more, I must write a book also, I must do this. You know, I have to tick off all the intellectual hallmarks, I have written a book, I am a motivational speaker. He does all of those things because he has the ability to, but he is a reticent, in 20"

And many people think, you're a comedian, how can you be like this? People don't realize that you might be a cricketer who scores in front of 80,000 people. But in a small social setup, you can be extremely anxious. Because you can't make personal one on one conversations and stuff like that. And it was because of certain incidents of you know, rejection that happened to you in school college. Again, I don't remember when and how, but it was there for sure. And that kind of changed in MTV. Because MTV was an environment where I had left Pune, and I had come to this place where and that was the first phase of MTV, right? Everybody suddenly had become creative. Everybody was acknowledging that bad jokes are good. And that bad jokes culture kind of opened my mind and said, here bad jokes are appreciated. And as Woody Allen would say that there are 100 bad jokes, and there is one good joke. And that one good joke goes into the library to make a stand up comedy act six months later. So it's a compilation of 100 good jokes, which come after 10,000 bad jokes. But that bad joke culture in MTV kind of opened my mind and I got appreciated for doing these one liners and stuff like that. Then one fine evening, a common friend Gigi George saw me imitating Sachin Tendulkar. And he said, What are you doing here, you should be a VJ. And then there was a VJ hunt next week. And Brocha called me on stage and I did a five minute act. And somebody told me it was a stand up comedy. And I said, What is this?

So I go to this Pancharatna building in South Mumbai, where the diamond, this thing is there. And I enter this Diamond Merchant is sitting, and there's three levels of security, I go there. What do you do? Filler, I said, you called me for filler, so I will fill it, what else should I say? So do it. So I did this imitation, and that's when I got my first show. He said, only a week later, I realized that this was a big show of the diamond industry along with the Oppenheimers of South Africa. And they were playing a cricket match, and there was Daler Mehndi, and I was a filler. That day, I realized that boss, if 200 diamond merchants are laughing for 10 to 12 minutes as a filler, there is something there. And in that MTV time, in that marketing, wherever I got this opportunity, I played Sidhu along with Cyrus Saukar in that show called MTV Fully Faltu, which did you write that show? I don't think I wrote that because I don't remember it, but my memory is a bit like yours. So I think Mrityunjay wrote that, before that, you did a couple of shows. And then that's when I realized that boss, there is something here. Something is going right here. And then the big break happened. And that was the time I had left MTV and joined the movie industry. The promoters of Sony had started a company and again, see, my thing was Metallite Productions. So we were, as marketing guys, we were the first to enter the television industry. And I said, before I experiment with these shows and all, let me do Bollywood once. And that was the time promoters of Sony started a film company. And this one and a half years were great lessons in human observations. I learned about the entertainment industry and I'll share some with you. I did marketing for three films, Nagesh Kuknoor's second film after Hyderabad Blues, which was called Teen Diware. There was Madhur Bhandar's second film after Chandni Bar called Satta with Raveena Tandon. And there was a film called Dil Wil Pyaar Pyaar, which was Anant Mahadevan's debut film. This is when I entered the movie industry before we come to that legendary moment that I had with Roshan Abbas, which kind of propelled the standup career. I spent one and a half years and I realized that this is a fascinating place just for people who like to observe other people. And here is where this, you know, small town interfacing with the established community is what I saw in real time. And it was great, right? At that point of time, there was no corporatization. I was the first marketing guy in an unorganized sector. So the old school script writers would come and, you know, show you scripts and stuff like that. And there was this funny incident that happened. A scriptwriter in Warsaw came and said, You are a new guy, I will tell you such a script, sir, you will go crazy. So now, two hours and we were still at the first shot. The man comes in, so what's next? The camera grabs the man. This went for one hour. We were still in the first scene. Then I said, sir, I have to go out a little. She won't understand people like you. So I said, what do I do now? You come later. Sir, let me tell you one thing, once you get this picture, you'll have to take it off."

Because I realized that there is an amazing thing that is happening between the established community. Which is people who don't consider this as a big thing because they are born in families. Who have all the resources and they have set the benchmark of coolness. They will talk Americanism, this is the kind of cinema we watch. Yes, Bollywood wants to make the same movies but they will do all of this. Now this is a benchmark that is set and this is the value of cool that has been attached. Now the small time actors from smaller cities come and interact with them. With a lot of social anxiety. And they realize that their work or their abilities is not what is going to be judged. How they behave in this milieu is what they are going to be judged on. And this is where I see a lot of this sad thing happening. Where a Marathi actor has come from say Satara, who is a good actor. Comes and goes into a party where those standard Juhu boys and girls are behaving in a certain way. And the entire next three years this guy is practicing to be that person. So that he feels that they will now accept him and give him that first role. And that one and a half two years is so traumatic because I am seeing the Marathi. Because I am now a guy who is MBA educated, can speak English and I am this. So that my social acceptability is reasonable here. And because I can speak good Marathi, my acceptability with this guy is also good. And I see this guy from somebody who is discussing Pula Deshpande, Gadhi Madgulkar, Kumar Gandharva. To suddenly meeting me in a party one year later. Hey babes, what's up dude?"

But trust me, nine out of ten talents that I met during that time was struggling to just fit in. Because they wanted to say dude and babes, rather than practice their craft. And unfortunately, that is the part I saw and I realized that this the Haryana factor that you are talking about. That time 20 years back I thought that I wish there were stars in their own domain. And they didn't have to suffer this. That was one thing I learned which I saw very closely. The second thing was the dynamics of actors coming late. Or behaving in a particular manner."

And I said, what is this psychology of people celebrating bad behavior? And then one actress, she started to behave very badly on the set. So I went to her and I said that ma'am, I mean, everybody is normal. If you have any issues, just let me know. I'll sort it out. And I was trying to be structured. Because that's the only thing I knew coming from a corporate background. And if you were structured, you were considered uncool. But I told her that this is what. And one day she got drunk and she called me to the set. And then we went to the vanity van and she told me that. Dude, come here. Let me explain to you what industry is. And I said, yes, ma'am, explain. Did you find anything lacking on the set? She said, if I behave well, you all will take me for granted. So I make sure that every day of my film, first day, I break a glass. I do something so that I start getting respect. If I don't do that, even the spot boy won't give me tea. When I do the first day, then I will get respect in the industry. And I was like, what kind of behavior is this? But then I realized that all this creative ecosystem here. Was about getting attention to yourself. And therefore it was important to behave badly. And that became culture. So if an actor came on time, he was considered an idiot. So he came three hours late. So that there was this danger and stuff like that. And this human behavior was great to watch. Because this was exactly what is the opposite of what is taught to you in management school. That systems and data and all of that. And then I realized the creative industry is about interplay of all these emotions put together. And to give structure to this emotional ecosystem. Is going to be the biggest challenge for the future. And that point of time there was no corporatization. So these were observations that kind of made me interested in this. And say like how do people behave. And that point of time the magic moment happened. When I got a call from Mr. Roshan Abbas. And said that, he didn't know me at that time. He said, I have heard that you do filler-biller. So can you do it for 12-15 minutes? So I said yes, I can do stuff like that."

I had started writing on observations. Whether those were the standard observations. I had started following what is the concept of the American. I believe that no comedian ever in the history of mankind can touch him. Because there was no standard thing of premise and punchline. This is a very bore concept. Premise and punchline. It is basically very populist way of getting a laughter. Pula Deshpande would talk 2 hours on walking in Vele Parle and he would make you laugh. It was that quality of humor. But then I realized that this is literary humor. Your understanding of life and society should be so high that you pick so many nuances. So then I followed the quintessential American model of that build the story and then the punchline. Build story, get punchline. I started doing that in cricket as well. And while I was doing this writing and stuff like that. I realized that my corporate job was now coming to an end. Though I have started enjoying putting a movie project together and seeing it till the end. I said that this looks like a far better in my zone. And then I quit my job. And just before quitting my job I got a call from the Sony network. This was 2003 World Cup. So my last film was still to release. And one of the shows that I had performed in MTV, the Sony chairman was there and Kapil Dev was also there. And these two guys had said that we are launching this kid with extra innings. I always joke in my initial years that nobody noticed me on extra innings because of Mandira Bedi. Even Bishan Singh Bedi didn't get noticed for years after taking 266 wickets. But to me that extra innings moment changed my life. I went to South Africa for the Cricket World Cup 2003. We stayed in Cape Town for two months. I witnessed the Centurion, Big Game, India, Pakistan as a cricket presenter. And the first day, Amit, I land in Cape Town. I don't know what I'm going to do, right? I've been told extra innings, you have to be a filler. And you have to fill in between the broadcast. And as soon as I land, this studio head takes me to a room where I enter and I see the mighty Tony Gregg. Six feet, seven inches, and I'm like, wow, this is something. And it's South Africa 2003, India touted to win the World Cup. The big team, Tendulkar, John Wright saying that, you know, this is the team that will win the World Cup. And I'm sitting there and saying that, boss, I don't know about comedy. But what has got me into cricket is these impersonations. So I have to continue stand-up comedy in the way it is, because that is going to get me to this world, which I've always wanted to be part of. So when, you know, sometimes journalists ask me, what does comedy mean? I'm like, man, this happened. I had to go here. Then it continued because it had a financial model. I continued. And then a few amazing things happened. Tony Gregg called me and said, hi, how are you doing? Good, Tony Gregg. And I imitated him and my first episode was with Tony Gregg himself."

Second day, I'm there and Tiger Pattodi calls me and says that, after I'd done an imitation of Jeffrey Boycott, he said, can you do that again? And I said, I'll tell you Tiger Pattodi, absolute legend of the game. And he started laughing. And from that day onwards, I became his best friend. That same evening, Vikram Sathe, Tiger Pattodi, Kapil Dev having a glass of wine, discussing Tiger's career. Can it be bigger than this for me? Who has not even been close to the world of cricket so far. And now, and joined by Ian Chappell and they're talking about those times and the Ashes and the Kerry Packer. And I was like, boss, pinch me because this is like big stuff. And that when I came back after the Centurion game, I said, that's it, brother. This is what you want to do in your life. Till the time you can extend and do what you can around this world. I think that will be life. And that I came back. I gave my resignation. Thankfully, I was called by the Sri Lanka Cricket Board. Oh, very funny story. 2004 Sri Lanka Cricket Board. I get called to do a stand up in the India versus, sorry, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. For playing that Asia Cup. I was told that except for president, I think Kumar Tunga was the president of Sri Lanka at that time. I said, apart from that, you can imitate anybody in Sri Lanka. And otherwise, we'll throw you back from the airport. So I went for the Asia Cup. I think 2004, 2005. I don't remember. And that's the first time I got friendly with Tendulkar. And I called Sameer Dighe and told him that, you know, I'm doing this act in Sri Lanka. Just tell Sachin. He said, don't need to tell Sachin anything. You go and chat with him before the show and tell him that you know me. Blah, blah. He's anyway seen you at the Seattle Awards a little bit. He'll be fine. I land there and I go to Sachin at the show and say, Sachin, I'm going to imitate a little bit. He said, what are you going to do? I've seen you for five minutes. That's okay. No problem. And I do a 20-minute act there, 20-25 minutes. I mean, to see the Indian team, Pakistani team, Bangladeshi team, Sri Lankan team, sorry, enjoying and stuff like that. I said, boss, it's just getting reinforced. And then I am walking outside. I did the Imsamam imitation in front of Imsamam. So I remember walking out of the banquet area and suddenly I bump into Imsamam. And I think it was Yasir Hameed, if I'm not mistaken, the opening batsman of Pakistan. And Imsamam comes and looks at me. It's fun to take off your pants in front of everyone. And I said, what an evening. And next day I was to fly back to India. I was at the breakfast table and Sachin Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh were sitting out there. And that was my first taste of a cricket story, you know, and that's what I realized that this is what I want to experience all my life. This comedy and all is okay, that will continue. And about the Sri Lanka wicket or something like that, I had this conversation and Sachin gave a five to eight minute explanation on how to play Murali Tharan. Wow. On that table. So I was asking him that, you know, how do you pick it and stuff like that. So the moment he realized that this was a relevant question. So I remember Yuvraj Singh saying, this is a cricket story, he will cook it. He said that. But he said something, something. And then Sachin said that, you know, you pick him from the arm, you'll be able to. And I realized that there was some chemistry brewing between somebody who you idolized and kind of became friends with later on. And that's when he knew that this is my kind of a guy and my friendship started with Tendulkar. And in that journey to discover a champion and a whole lot of champions all over, starting to tour with Sunandan, with me. And the big moment was obviously when I was part of the ESPN commentary team in 2006. So yeah, coming back from the 2004 Asia Cup performance, it got reinforced that boss, you're here to stay, it was my gateway to the world of cricket. Comedy was just one way to reach there."

        "message": "But yeah, at least making fun of cricketers and creating jokes around the game kind of made me go closer to the game. And that's when, you know, things started happening, corporate shows started happening and the big break happened, which was 2006 ESPN, when they called me to be part of the commentary box. Now, up until now, you have to understand that Harsha Bhogle is the only external person who's in the commentary box. Gautam Bhimani is doing picture stories, but he's still not in the commentary box. But I have been called to be in the commentary box, obviously with a view of making Test Cricket interesting in terms of, you know, what's happening with the broadcast. So though I was in the comm box for certain periods, I was mainly doing a show called T-Spot, which was in tea at the TA interval break along with Alan Wilkins. But I was in conversation with Waseem Akram during the game in between and so on and so forth. And Gavaskar and Shastri and Harsha and all of that. That was a big, big break for me because I thought that now they are kind of accepting me as somebody who understands the game beyond the comedy. And this is 2006. So two years of active comedy had already happened. And so looking forward to going to South Africa, three test match series. There was a chance everybody was saying that, hey, there's a good chance that India will beat South Africa in South Africa. So there was this buzz in the commentary box. And it so happened that we reached there. Indian team was in good spirits and we won the first test match. If you remember, that was that big test. And we thought that from there on, things will go good for us, which didn't happen. Now I am there. I'm doing my stuff, slowly getting popularity. Because see, at the end of the day, cricket experts are a lot. But when you add humor to it, suddenly there's this vibe in the box and the broadcast, which everybody is enjoying and stuff like that. But one incident happened there that kind of put me off commentary forever. And that was during, I think, the second test match. I don't remember whether it was at Durban or was it the first test match. I think the last day of the first test match, where I was doing a small piece on the ground, near the pitch, which was kind of a humorous take on the first test match. And I was wearing India colors because I'd been told when I was going to South Africa by the Sony team. I mean, I was lucky to go to South Africa because earlier they wanted to shoot everything here. But because there was paucity of time, I finally got to come to South Africa. And I got these clothes from the Nike shop, which was the Indian attire. And by that time, that big deal with Nike had happened with the BCCI. So I wore that outfit. I went into the middle of the pitch and I was just about to record and walk in Sunil Gavaskar. And he says, why are you wearing these colors? So I got a shock of my life that in front of the entire crew and all these guys shouting at me. And I was 29-30, so I just stopped for a moment, but I didn't say anything to him. He continued, you've not played test cricket for India. Why are you wearing the India colors? And this is just ridiculous what this has come to. Test match cricket has certain value and started giving me a lecture on the ground in front of everybody. Now, I am thinking this is an official merchandise that I've picked up from a Nike showroom."

No, no, this is just, you know, you test cricket is for pride and some shit he gave me for 20 seconds. I kept quiet. Did that episode a little bit. Now, that's when I realized that this guy is extremely moody. I walk up to the commentary box. I tell the producer that, you know, this is not something I'll appreciate. But he said, nahi yaar, moody aadmi hai, don't get upset and stuff like that. That same evening, if I'm not mistaken, was a small episode that I had to do with Gavaskar only along with Wasim Akram and Alan Wilkins. So at that point of time, there was this thing about wives and girlfriends coming to cricket tournaments. So when Alan asked me this question in that segment in On Tee Spot, I said that this is a question I cannot answer. I think I'll leave it to Wasim bhai and Sunny bhai. I don't know what Sunny bhai thought. He gave the answer and then he threw a big tantrum after that."

And interestingly, on the flight back, just before the flight, when I was driving to the airport, I got stopped by cops. And this is like, you know, I'm an ICC, whatever, ESPN commentator. They stopped me in the middle of the journey to the airport. And those two cops looked at me and said, you know, open, open, open. Drugs, drugs, drugs. And I'm like, what is wrong? And they're like, I'm going to the airport to catch my flight. And they take all of the money out of my wallet. And say that, you know, you go like this. These are cops doing it to a commentator in South Africa. Going, somebody going to the airport. Itna open pagalpan chal raha tha uss time. Anyway, airport mein main gaya, flight pe baitha. Aur maine kaha ki, broadcasting ke nazdeek, life mein kabhi nahi aane ka. Because what I had seen, Amit, was that Harsha had gone through all of this for a long time. But Harsha is obsessed by cricket and commentary. He can't do anything else. So he did not have the option that I had. Where I said, boss, yeh mereko yeh click ke nazdeek aane ka hi nahi. Because they will not accept anybody from the outside. It's not, means they're insecure. And specially Sunny bhai was insecure about any, that's what I thought. What was I going to do to Sunny Gavaskar? He's a living legend. And why am I going to do anything that is going to affect him? But then I realized that this is how it's going to be in commentary. If you are able to, and Harsha has taken all of this stress and the insults over a period of 24, 30, 40 years or whatever he's done broadcasting. But he knows this is his calling. There's nothing else I'll do. And therefore he did that. I said, I'm not going to do it. I came back and I'd heard that a lot of things happened in ESPN after that. I said, boss, stand up comedy karenge and I'll create my own ecosystem of content, which I will do on live shows. Luckily, YouTube had just started. So that clip of Seat Awards now was the first comedy clip on YouTube to go viral. So everybody knew what I was doing. And therefore I said that any content that comes, which is apart from broadcasting, I will do on cricket. And hopefully at some point of time, create my own content on YouTube. And I will leave this game from that point of view, because I realized that this is the only country where the board decides who the commentator is. It's not the broadcaster's prerogative. And these guys are not going to accept any outsider coming and stuff like that. And that's what changed my life. And I'm very happy that I didn't stay in broadcasting because I would not have been able to live this under pressure kind of life. Came back home. Thankfully, the corporate boom. And that was that period of great fun because every corporate was taking their dealers and listing employees to South Africa, to Greece. So with that 2007-12 period, I probably would have done hundreds and thousands of shows, 200-300 shows, just traveling abroad with 500 dealers. And sometimes I do it in my jokes. And I think that's to say that Gujarat became more vibrant, not because of the chief minister there, but because of Bangkok. Because all sales targets were dependent on going to Bangkok. And if you did well, and Gujaratis who had never gone beyond Bhavsar and Nadiad, they went to Bangkok and they were happy. They doubled their turnover. And sometimes I feel that we revived the Thailand economy."

So because I had befriended the cricketers by now, in the middle of a tour, having a nice meal or dinner with, say, Rahul Dravid, or for that matter, Asaurav Ganguly, maybe sometimes members from the opposition team who had seen me perform in probably an ICC cricket event somewhere. This was where my actual journey started. To live international sport at the time when the action is happening. So when you know the next session for the test match is interesting, and you've had dinner with, say, Anil Kumble the night before, because you bumped into him in some Indian restaurant, and then he's kind of sharing the dynamics. That's when the games kind of started opening up for me, where I started understanding the psychology of sport, the physicality of sport, the human behavior side of it, the competitive advantage that people get out of sledging. What is purposeful practice? What is team dynamics? What is advantage during sessions? What is mental makeup? What is routine? What is visualization? So this started getting easier and easier for me to understand, because I was hearing it from the horse's mouth at the time when the action was happening. So 2006 onwards to 2013 till Sachin retired, that seven years I lived cricket in its totality. Because even before the Sydney Gate happened, or after the Sydney Gate happened, I was in that press conference, what Robak was writing about Ricky Ponting, my interaction with Ricky Ponting during that particular tour. So this was like gold dust coming to me and saying, forget the comedy, this is what you've been waiting for. And that was the reason that book happened, because I thought that, hey, I am privy to so many of these stories, real time, let me try and see if I can use humor and put it in a book format. That is where I got interested in sports psychology, where I said, boss, the dynamics of understanding human behavior in the context of high performance sport is the ultimate you can ever get. And cricket is a very amazing game because it has so many facets, unlike football where, you know, whatever, number of people playing for one and a half hours and it's over. There's a wicketkeeper who has his own story. There is a third man who has his own story. There is a spin bowler who's coming with a new ball who has his own story, which Ashwin beautifully explains in What The Duck, my show where he talks about, you know, Ajinkya Rahane giving him a new ball because he realized that there's moisture and spin might help him in Melbourne. And that's how he got Steve Smith out. So all these stories, imagine happening to you while the process is on,"

Attention to detail, the preparation. 2011, I remember Sachin Tendulkar was not in form. Rahul Dravid was getting bold to Hilfenhaus. Every test match that he played, we lost that series after winning, after losing a close game at Melbourne. I remember going with Sachin to a vineyard, and he explaining to me the dynamics of how we lost that test. And, you know, talking to Rahul about how his mental frame was extremely good during the Melbourne test. And after that, it started going down. This was a lesson in psychology. This was a lesson in human behavior, which I was just grasping. I said, hey, let me just continue my comedy till the time I can in order to get a sense of what is happening in the world. But I realized that my money was coming through corporate India. And that's when, as Roshan said, that the musical part of it, I started developing observations, politics, current affairs, all these things I started writing on my own so that my act would become more robust. Because at any given point of time, a stand-up comedian should have three hours of material. So your 20 minutes get repeated, which is your best, because you're safe, unless you know the audience is a little open with experimentation. Because unlike the comedy movement, which started with say Veer Das and Papa CJ sometime in 2008-9, I had no concept of experimenting in a club, getting my material tested and doing it in a corporate show. All my testing was happening on real-time shows. So my risk-taking ability went down because I could not have risked material in an Asian paint show. So what I would do is make three to five minutes of new material. If I would go from Asian paints to Procter & Gamble, I would test this five minutes. From Procter & Gamble to ICICI, I would test another two minutes. But it took me six months to make 30 new minutes. Whereas if I was a club comedian, I would have tested material every day. But by the time this culture happened, I had already done 8-10 years of work. And then again, inertia had set in."

These are choices all creators are confronted with at some point in time. You can take your work in one direction or you can take it into the other direction. And you make a choice. And that choice changes what you do. And then what you do changes who you are. And you become a completely different person. Like maybe for example if the actual stand-up scene if the scene starts earlier or you come later. Then you might say that cricket is fine. That's just one thing. Let me also do this. And then you become the Veer Das or whatever. Or the line you chose which was to go sort of much more into cricket.

Veer Das has been studying comedy since the time he finished his graduation and stuff like that. I was an accidental comedian. But for me what was important was my first love which was cricket. And therefore the comedy was just a way to reach the world of cricket. The moment it started working and I realized that boss I have it in me to explore the larger canvas. That is when I started doing other material to survive in this world. And then obviously there was a business model at play. The incentive was very very simple. If I have to continue my stand-up career in the corporate which is going to pay my bills and not cricket because cricket is a choice I have made. I have stayed away from broadcast because broadcast is where the money is. So I have stayed away from that. So I will get my ROI from my corporate shows for which I now need to start talking about what is happening around the world, human behavior, little bit of Bollywood music and all of that. That keeps my system going and makes me go into the world that I love to be in. So my ability to spend two months in Australia during a test series was actually only one or two shows. The extension was paid by me. So that I could fund only because I could do this. Unfortunately because I didn't have the drive for comedy which is like let's do a new act. Let's do this. Let's do shows in the world. I don't want to do it. Australia, South Africa, West Indies Sri Lanka, Bangladesh this is done. So I think it was a problem of again the core point that I made that I was just happy in the current moment and that didn't drive excellence from a creative perspective. Which today I don't have any regrets but I thought I should have pushed myself a little bit more to explore this so much. Today I feel because I am now evolved into, I want to know more about so many different things under the sun which was not there 10 years back. In the last 8 to 9 years probably I have said that hey I don't even want to do comedy now. I want to actually try something completely different. Because when your growth stops then you realize that boss that profession is not worth chasing. And that has happened to me every 5-6 years with what I have done. So today comedy is absolutely not interested at all. But now I am putting a frame to myself and saying that hey can I spend 3 sessions with Vijay Gokhale who gave me a great perspective on China and can I put something interesting which may not be pure stand up but a perspective on what happened from Deng to Xi Jinping. I am thinking on those lines it may never happen. I am just giving you a China example because it just happened 15 days back. But maybe my way of comedy is now to explore areas because what is the beauty of comedy is the moment you want to look at humor in a mundane subject your ability to grasp things becomes stronger. Because comedy means thinking. And that's why if I am reading a book today I would take 6 months to finish a big book because every 8 pages I would be probably thinking that this is like this we can treat it like this. There is a correlation in this. Comedy is what? Joining two dots. You have read this and this. When you add this in comedy, you get fun out of it. So today I am seeing if I can evolve myself and use comedy for something else to get knowledge and be curious about a different world which I did for cricket. But it's still an exploratory thought. Unfortunately my outcome has never been that I make a great creative piece. And that is what Roshan always criticizes me for. Why aren't you giving a creative output? I am not able to do that. What is going on and survival for that moment Tomorrow he tells me that hey I am doing a show. You have to make a 20 minute piece on this. Then I will go and do it. But that's not creative. That is this beautiful word that Vijay Tendulkar only told me once. I asked him what is creative? He said urgency. I didn't understand this. He said Vikram, sometimes a lot of creativity is wasted. I was an editor of Maharashtra Times. I used to get this much time and I used to write my story on the train. And I had deadlines to submit that story. And my best creative work happened in deadlines. So that urgency of the project helped me get the most creative I could ever get. Now some people might disagree with this theory. But I think this is a very interesting theory because my good creative work also has come under pressure. But because I was a freelancer my pressure on myself was not good enough."

I was getting salary, that was enough. Suddenly I discovered comedy. From comedy to cash register. He was raking it in. Sometimes when I tried to put numbers, he gets so shy. He doesn't even discuss his own money with anyone in his life. You will get it. You are printing. Favorite life. My thing is, my math immediately works. If you do 3000 shows and I calculate, put a base of 1 lakh. It will be 30 crores. No, I used to do 2000 in the beginning. But the logic is, now what happened? So you found that source, creative goal and comedy was never his goal. Right. But it was a combination as you said, what he said, that cricket, which was something he loved. Yes, intellectual pursuit. See, his desperation is to be known as an intellectual. I can tell you even today. Why did he write a book? Because when you write a book, you become a person. I will say more things. After that, why did he do TV? At that time, Sathe was a creative entrepreneur. He did 3 creative ventures. Multiple things. I do this, I do that. I do this, I do that. Then he realized, this is too much hard work. It was the middle class Maharashtrian. Why should I do this? Make 4 jokes."

No, he was bloody talented. And he had a niche. Sir, we spent 10 years in comedy. After that, there are comedians in every corner. You get them for 10,000 or 50,000.

They both sort of arise from the same situation where you are someone who played cricket passionately, knew the game, understood the game really well. But you didn't reach that level of that Tendulkar and all of that. And then later on, you make an entry and you are with all of them. So, now a couple of sort of questions arise here. And one is that in terms of human beings like all these guys are your personal friends now right? But the thing is when you first interact with them, they are also wary. Because they are superstars and they are wary of anybody else basically. And some like Sunny Bhai could be, you know, are also fierce about protecting their turf. But otherwise, they are wary, they have learned to be wary, they have learned to distrust the press and distrust others and they are kind of in their own bubble. So, how was it then? But I would imagine that once you break past that bubble, for you to have that personal relationship with them becomes much easier because you have also played cricket at Dadar Gymkhana or Shivaji Park or wherever you played. You've gone through the grind of doing all that. You bowled to Sachin, you once said, which in fact you must answer first, what was that like? So, how was it like breaking through and then those personal relationships and do you find that people at the top like that are a special kind of lonely? Because you have access cut off completely from the normal world and the normal life and the normal friendships like, let's meet at Starbucks and you can't quite do that. Or let's meet at Katte. So, what was it kind of, what was that like? That once you break past the barrier, can you also then just see them as normal people? You've reached a new level but essentially you are the same. You also love cricket, you also play cricket."

Because let them be there, just admire them because when you know them as a person you kind of get a little defeated by this entire experience. And that happened with Sunny but life was good. Then came Sachin Tendulkar who probably is one of the finest human beings that I met in this especially in this cricketing zone. The most secure and we were very lucky that we toured at a time when there are too many good people in one team. See, whatever said and done I don't think, it's like in one of your episodes, one of the speakers says that there is SD Burman, there is Naushad, there is Madan Mohan, there is Shankar Jayakishan. This is a time of music that can never be replicated again. I think Tendulkar, Dravid, Lakshman, Sehwag, Kumble it's very difficult to get this kind of people in the same team and I was lucky that all these people were very secure. Thankfully, they first became my fan. And they realized I was more than a fan. And I think this transition of being more than a fan is when you get into the inner circle of cricketers. When they realize that boss this guy is not there as a threat, he is genuinely interested in the game, he is making me laugh also and he is asking me questions that are not journalistic. How do you feel? When I am talking of Anil Kumble I am saying that when did you realize that the LBW decision is going to be the biggest decision for you in your life because you are a leg spinner typically only when you bowl a googly it will get you an LBW and he said let me tell you how I did it. And this is also a very funny story. You can prompt me when you want me to tell this story. You can tell the story now. So it's a fascinating story and I asked Anil bhai this question and said that how do you get a LBW decision especially when you got it so often. He said Vikram, the biggest thing in life that I had to do is to convince the umpire that I was not"

So he said there was net practice, Mohammad Kaif was batting and he said I told Kaif that I will call Brian Juerling you don't play him and let him bat on the pad so practice sessions happening he says Brian why don't you come and do a little bit of umpiring in the nets and Anil said I started bowling to Kaif, Kaif would not play the shot, I said to Brian Juerling how was that? Yeah looks close second ball again he bowls Brian how was that? Yeah looks close Anil said that's what I want to tell you I don't get the leg spinner going, it's the straighter one that matters he said I had left that thought with Brian Juerling, next day he gave me 4 LBWs So the fact that I had asked the right question to Anil Kumble gave me a great story about how a bowler thought through and realized that if he had to get LBWs he had to make the umpire believe that he doesn't spin the ball"

No you haven't because you become a top guy and you want to now hobnob with all the people who are in that zone you are lonely because you are hobnobing with them and which I have always mentioned to all my creative people and they say you know Mumbai is such a lonely place and this place and that place, I said the problem is that you are looking at transactional relationships if you are looking for friendships in your office which are based on a fundamental of transaction or for that matter if the business community itself, Roshan is meeting 6 clients and he is now one of the clients doesn't reply to his call when he is not feeling well and say this is such a lonely world because in Roshan's mind he is my new friend I drank with him 6 times but he was not your friend so you have started expecting from him and people who go to the top now want those top people to start giving him unconditional love like what his friends did when he was young that is a wrong play and I do believe that if you in that journey of going to the top are going to forget the people who were with you during that process because they are now down market and you are up market now, that is when loneliness at the top happens many people I have seen have managed this because they have just remained normal and Sachin is a great example because he became a prince at 14 and 16 so there can't be a bigger celebrity in India during that 24 years and he is in conversation with all the people that he played with in his early years so I think that it is to do a lot with your perspective after you get to the top as well and I have seen a lot of people fail at that level"

So many of these would be small town kids who have come up and who simply cannot handle the fame and the money and they kind of fall apart and what has happened since in Indian cricket and it's a damn good thing that it's happened that small town India has really asserted itself that players can come from anywhere, perhaps starting with the Dhoni Yuvraj generation but small town has kind of taken over and you have people from many different backgrounds which is wonderful but it means that the sort of, you know even if Sachin, Ravid, Kumle were from different cities it was homogenous in terms of those middle class values which means that you are much more settled and you don't go through those experiences and the second angle is coming to a city, right when you speak about Sachin, sure he became a big star very early but he was already part of what seems to me to be part of a really settled community that Bandra East you know, Saikar, Sivas or whatever that community of artists and cultured people and whatever and you're part of that where nobody gets too big for their boots as that, you know, again the classic middle class Maharashtrian mentality even if in terms of income you break out of that and that sense of community is there but for a lot of people who come to Bombay, including me when I first came to Bombay, you are atomized you know, there is no community everything initially is transactional you have no friends, it's atomized everything is transactional maybe over a period of time you build a community of friends, maybe you don't but if you've come from a small town somewhere and you're thrust into the spotlight like this to say that loneliness is a choice, I don't think it's completely fair in those cases because you don't even know, you know, at the one hand you might be mixing with the babes, dudes kind of thing and saying, I don't belong here which is actually a better thing to say to yourself than trying artificially to fit in and on the other side you no longer have any common thread that connects you with whoever you might have known in your hometown back there, it just feels very awkward on both sides"

Right and today there will be young people who will be part of your organization and remember on the group I would often use this word guys right guys can you do this? So one day you know this person said that you know I'd appreciate if you actually were a little more conscious of the fact that the team has people who might be gender fluid and people who you know have not you know would prefer if they referred to you referred to everybody from a different thing and the entire team appreciated it. I mean we all actually sat and when I am now conscious of this or whatever. Now sometimes you are taking things too far whatever. Hard discussions sometimes on these things. They are unafraid to say it. Now will everybody accept it at large? As you said this is a great example that you gave about you know what's happening in football right now today there was a thing that when they Japan lost the manager was standing there and bowing to all the fans and I mean it's beautiful or the Brazilian team guy hugging because his teammates with the rival team is the South Korean player and hugging him and saying that you know you gave your professional best and I did. I really it is these things that need to be celebrated a lot more. Somewhere I feel that we have also started in some bits like when roadies started happening I was a little scared. Because you somewhere when in Big Boss or roadies you bring in people and characters where you are celebrating the lowest common denominator not the highest common factor. You are doing it for TRP etc. But believe you me you are setting a bad precedent. To give you an example on the other side a boy used to work with me my content team and he was on the train going to Lucknow and he came back and said I've got to tell you the most brilliant thing. So what? He said that we were sitting in the train and suddenly you know his phone was borrowed by the other person because he wanted to use the internet. He said use this phone. He had two phones. I said why two phones? He said my parents also use this phone. I said do I watch MX on this? Right? And sometimes there is a channel of Balaji which has some adult content. I watch that but I keep this for my parents. India most young people everybody still has this sense which is why a Panchayat works. Which is why you know a Gullak works a Tathastu works at one level and we just need to learn to celebrate it a lot more. It's not that just the fine the blood and gore in a Mirzapur suddenly shocks you. But then it becomes that everyone wants to do that. You know like if you go to a OTT today to say what do you want to see? For two years ago I remember when we used to have meetings all discussions were boss you know sex, crime, murder extramarital affair. What are you saying? But there is a bunch of people who went back and said no we will keep bringing different things and they have created that space. So somewhere I do feel that this is a lot about I believe that this generation is very very different. I think one of the big things is remember that most of the people are born with the internet. They have been born with a window to many worlds. We had a window to either our neighbors or our parents. Parents told us those values. College or school or whatever. They have a million words. I can't stop my daughter from watching Euphoria which I am very scared that a 14 year old girl saw. What is Euphoria? So Euphoria is this show on Netflix which actually if you see had themes that were very extreme. You know so an underage person having an affair with a married man or whatever because of a dating thing that happens. Drug use etc. Casual sex. Now as a parent there was this big thing. But I also know that at the same time she has a set of values which she has been brought up with. There are conversations. My daughter can sit with me and have conversations on topics that she could. I can't believe my sister could have ever had with my father. And we have them. Sometimes it is to me a little difficult. And I will tell Shaheen to sit and say listen can you have this chat with her or whatever. I have to say Abba you are giving me that dad look. You know if she is dressing up or whatever and she is going out. Now she is at that age. There will be boys. There will be discovery. But you know as long as there are these multiple windows open. My fear is when the single window becomes that one window which everybody is celebrating which becomes the fad of the moment. And 90% of fads as you know are the negative fads are what algorithms pick up and put out because shock gets a lot more response. We react a lot faster. But somewhere when I see the better India story coming up on my feed I am a lot more happier saying this also comes. Or when I see the work that Yuva does. Nikhil was on your podcast or whatever.

Now what social media has done is especially Twitter in trying to maximize engagement like Jonathan Haidt has pointed out how toxic the Facebook like button and the Twitter retweet button are and specifically the Twitter quote tweet for the kind of rudeness and interactions it encourages. What it has done is that it has amplified the worst aspects of our character. The tribalism, the antagonism, all of that. Whereas I think that it is possible to be intentional about it and say that we won't amplify these particular buttons but we'll amplify others because we also have that sense, that longing for community, that longing. You know you want to start those positive feedback loops. But I think all of that is possible but the one thing which will make it possible is if people are well fed. So we'll take a quick lunch break"

Not that 30 years have passed in dementia and we don't remember anything which is already the case with you. And I asked Roshan how many of the four of us on this table will reach 120 and he said at least two. But I wanted to expound on that because when you sort of explain that, everything about it seemed very rational and in fact over the last few months I have also been doing my little bits of biohacking, reverse type 2 diabetes all of that. So I understand that we know a bit more than we used to and a lot of progress is being made in this field not just in terms of understanding it to begin with."

        "message": "Tell me your thoughts on it. So I think you know when we were growing up and I remember in school whenever there used to be any and you know textbooks used to have a little bit on India's past and stuff and I always remember that it used to say that in the Vedas they used to say that there are four you know parts of a man's life and they used to say 25 years which is Brahmacharya 25 years which is Grahasthya 25 which is Vriddha and 25 which is Sanyas. So obviously they were looking at a 100 year life span then as an imagined idea. Now let's say whatever happened, life happened you know and stuff. Today we have now reached with a certain number of scientists and I mean which is why this whole thing about you know what alternate therapies work what don't and now I guess when I have a certain amount of time I've started exploring that a lot. I think a lot of it started with my parents aging. I am like any other person I'm sure I mean I'm obsessed with my parents and I keep constantly trying to see how you know my dad's 82 okay so how can he lead to leave a healthy 100 and a wealth conference which I host every year had a person who came and said so once you have made money what stands in the way of you enjoying it and people said you know time and this and that and the person said no it's just health and longevity and which is why most entrepreneurs you know who have made big money are now investing in health tech and are looking at longevity as a science. What this has led to is a lot of you know looking at the future and some amount of looking at the past for solutions. Yesterday I was reading something about the vagus nerve in our body because you know we were talking about anxiety me and my wife and stuff and it said it's a vagabond nerve. It's present it's not present from one point to one point it's present in so many places and then the ways in which bringing down anxiety etc was mentioned seemed a little bit of yoga seemed a little bit of science Deepak Chopra was talking about as well and I'm slowly going towards saying that there are five facts that I have now David Sinclair someone I follow now very closely there is of course Huberman I think is another person who you know talks a lot about health and these two people I follow and David Sinclair I follow like obsessively He's written this great book called Lifespan. Yeah exactly and apart from the book the podcast he did on Lifespan with the person who helped him co-author the book in which they asked a lot of questions and it seemed to break it down ultimately to a couple of things. One was a very simple thing of turning and saying that your body needs enough time to regenerate which is why it requires more than 8 hours of sleep. Most of us don't get that. So A if you can move towards that. Secondly, cells need to be shocked out of complacency so over a period of time our body becomes absolutely complacent. Our muscle tissue at some point will stop generating because your brain is saying I can only now take care of X amount of things so if he's not using his arms too much let that muscle degenerate let me focus on the legs or other parts or whatever. So therefore if you really want to look at how to keep your cells enhanced you've got to give them extremes and which is why if you see there's a lot of extreme temperature therapy. So if you go towards the fjords or anything which is above the Arctic Circle there's a lot of ice dipping that happens. I had gone to Finland for a thing and one day they were doing this breaking an ice thing and actually everybody diving and how long could they stay inside. But today it's a scientifically proven fact that if you spend time in really you know water which is below zero degrees the cells are shocked into saying oh these cells have crossed the extreme they should die. These cells are now in their prime and they need to be primed to handle this as well. Saunas and extreme heat. So therefore extreme temperature events if you introduce in your life they immediately lead to more longevity. Personally I've researched it read about it and I'm trying to see if one can do it to a certain degree. I've tried a little bit of it the ice therapy is bloody cold and difficult but it's crazy when you do it you really feel invigorated. There's something about it. The two things which are chemical formulas which seem to really work is what David Sinclair has researched a lot. Of course a lot of the research is on mice now some of it is getting into human trials or whatever is two things called resveratrol and NMN slash NAD one he calls the petrol the other he calls the accelerator. So he says you know that you need both of them. One helps so after a certain point in time the cells do not produce internal energy to be able to keep themselves going which is why NMN is needed and resveratrol is the pedal which makes sure that there is acceleration in terms of that. So these are two more habits. And then breathing where a lot of what I have learned over the years is now I mean when I did yoga many many years ago and then gave it up entirely and now I just try to practice if nothing else most of people do shallow breathing which is like we take about 12 to 15 breaths in a minute. Whenever you will practice breathing as a practice you will realize that people are bringing it down to about 4 breaths a minute and that is again because you know like so a simple technique is what you call a 4-7-8 which is you take a breath in a sharp exhale inhale of 4 hold for a 7 and exhale at 8. So that with various kinds of breathing you are actually able to get your body rid of a lot of toxins, get a lot of your anxiety out your stress out and I you know I have always looked at cancer and I know that somewhat of cancer obviously I don't know about the heredity I am not a doctor but I have always somehow found that there is a lot of life events that are associated with a set of people who get some of these diseases which has a lot of stress a lot of anxiety and stuff. So I think if one can follow some of these things definitely we will bring our life spans up and it is happening already you know I mean I can easily see 100 but if you are able to even do your diet you know which and food is something which is the only place where I don't want to control my diet I want to enjoy good food with this combination 120 and it is happening. You go to Okinawa and I mean this entire research that happened about Japan and why the people in this particular region of Japan have an average life span of about 100 plus and some of them are 120, 118 etc have lived that long and lived healthy lives to that age so I personally believe in this I am trying a lot of this right now so maybe in episode 3000 and whatever when you and I have reached that healthy"

So I also kind of interacted with a lot of scientists in that company that I am invested in called Genepath Diagnostics and these are mostly geneticists, so they typically avoid answering these questions because they are into pure science, right, they are into solving medical problems at the moment, saying that hey, how do you detect blood cancers, how do you solve the problem of spinal muscular atrophy in Turkey where we've got a great deal where the Turkish government believes that the amount of money that you are going to spend in curing patients will be far higher than money you will spend on diagnosing, so it makes sense that you diagnose an entire population and it might be cheaper for you to identify those patients, treat them effectively rather than doing a random cure for a lot of people and having the insurance come into play. So what I realized after talking to them, there is a triangle, one is what Roshan talked about is stress and anxiety, it's the cause of major diseases, now that you can solve by yoga or whatever you do, breathing exercise and stuff like that. The other two components that kind of excited me and as you rightly said whether it is the Googles, whether it's the Facebooks of the world, all the big companies are trying to live for another 40 years so all their excess research in the name of hey we want to do impact work in health is basically trying to solve these problems and the two problems that I thought that resonated with me one was a field called pharmacogenomics and the other field was basically slowing down degeneration of white loggers, so the pharmacogenomics is a very interesting field of play, what it essentially says is that suppose you use a certain statin or for that you use a blood pressure medicine for your blood pressure, you have to understand that all blood pressure medicines may not work on everybody, so therefore I will do a clinical analysis of your blood sample, I will do a full analysis and I will tell you that for each of your organs or each of your medical problems, these are the set of medicines that you should be taking and the effectiveness of the medicine on your body"

I was in conversation with Ponting we were doing like a 7 city tour with ING Bank and I asked Ricky Ponting that you know I played little bit of under 19 cricket and stuff like that and we never found gaps. When you are a batsman you play by instinct if it goes in a gap you take a single or you just whatever you don't take a single so he said that this is where the growth of a batsman happens explain it to me how does it happen so he said in the initial years of my batting when I came into bat I would look at the fielders and I would have these fielders in my subconscious and that would give me a framework based on how I am going to react because at the time the ball is coming at 140 you are just backing what you have learned over the years but your subconscious graph that you have will give you a sense of where the ball will go. He said over a period of time I started realizing that my gaps were going down and I thought to myself what was the problem and one day it dawned to me that I needed to change my reference point so I said what is the reference point and that one sentence I thought was the most outstanding statement said by somebody he said a good batsman imprints the fielders in the subconscious a great batsman imprints the gaps the moment that reference points had become the gaps he said I started finding the gaps beautifully and I remember sharing this story in a Bajaj auto show and Rajiv Bajaj came up to me and said that Vikram this is the most profound thing I have learned in business when you look at competition you behave like the competition if you look at the need gaps of the market"

I was watching this show a lot which is currently trending on Netflix I was wondering why is it trending it's a Bihar cop story it's about Diyamit Lodha you know book on killing the biggest criminal of that time and caste politics and everything else which is going on and in the beginning they were travelling in a train it's the first time he is going to Bihar there is an old couple sitting in front of him and the guy turns and says why are you going to Bihar he says to work who goes to work in Bihar and the old man turns and says sir if you are going to work there because he is an IPS officer he says in life you can do two things from Bihar either you can earn a lot of money or you can earn a lot of name and respect now you have to decide what you have to earn and you know one very old jeep ad used to have this jeep on the top of a cliff and I don't know where they were trying to make that correlation or whatever because this whole thing about spirit and blah blah blah but below that was that line which I often quote saying do not mistake your net worth for your self worth and this constant thing nowadays who made it, who made it, where it was made how much it was made, this constant following of these success metrics that are so obsessive somehow I find and I think Vikram and I and a whole bunch of our friends resonate on the fact that it is not our primary driver, I think our primary driver is a lot more about just enriching life, doing things to a very large degree one beautiful lesson that I had in life was Javed we were going to record a song for Colgate and we were crossing the Juhu flyover to go to the highway and then we had to go to film city to shoot and my son had just been born and I was very excited and I turned to him and I said that Javed sahab you know my son and I really want him to read and I really want him to study and you know he should have the right upbringing Ikhlaq hone chahiye acche, jitni mujhe Urdu aati thi main poori use kar raha tha Ikhlaq and Javed sahab just turned and said aap chahate hain woh padhe? padhiye aap chahate hain woh achhi baate kariye? achhi baate kariye? toh kehta hai bachche sheesha hote hain jo dekhte hain usi ko reflect karte hain and then he gave me multiple examples from Bollywood of people he said you know that people who did things and how it reflects and I genuinely find that do not say do and I love you like this, bias for action I keep saying this, ke karo yaar agar duniya mein kisi cheez koi cheez khalti hai toh usko badalne ke liye kuch karo agar koi cheez hai jo fulfill karna hai toh karo toh, page one toh uska complete karo don't keep it just stuck in your mind, that's one thing for sure that I keep telling people and across all the people, I mean you know Bachchan sahab was one of the first people I said I did the interview with, then I did another interview, I worked with him on one or two other projects and whatever even today everyone, there are a hundred stories about Mr. Bachchan, good, bad, all kinds but his punctuality someone everybody will even today talk of because ek work ethic hai, there are so many times that I end up going to functions and stuff and I reach on the given appointed time and I am the earliest person in the place and I am berated by everyone around saying kyun karte ho, kyun jate ho but I just find that keeping a good work ethic and a professional work ethic is a very important thing that somewhere in this jugaad, shortcut let me tell you five life hacks to do the following nahi the simplest hack in the world is put in the work, just put in the work keep putting in the work and it will ultimately bear fruit to that whatever and it's an important thing I think for people to do the other thing that I have actually now started and I think a lot of it is actually realization is Angad Daryani is this boy who I we were doing something for DRGO and we had to get a bunch of, so we do a couple of these culture immersion, so we wanted people from various fields, so Masaba came and spoke about fashion, then we had Ankur coming and talking about music and from Gully Boy to Gehraiya, I mean look at the diversity of those two albums and how he did it fabulous, we had a gender activist who came in called Durga amazing again, great conversation and then we had this boy Angad Daryani, all of 20 something and whatever and Angad has set up a company called Praan and they are actually building these large format filters which, sorry they are actually taking carbon from the atmosphere and in a filterless technology because his logic was that even creating the filter one of the biggest polluting processes is creating the filter which absorbs the carbon, so why can you not have a filterless process which he's built, a very interesting model where you don't have to pay for the machine, you pay per person per month etc and stuff now being adopted by the Tata's just today the government has taken up a lot of this and all brands wanted to know about the metaverse and what's going to happen and whatever so I turned to Angad, what about the metaverse he says let's first save the universe then let's think of the metaverse you know and I genuinely felt that this generation as I say, this generation unafraid, doers you know, really putting themselves out there and he said it in such a simple way that I just carried on that conversation for one hour, it was a beautiful immersion of knowing how they're doing it, why he's doing it and today, like two days later I turned and said anyway I can help you, I'd love to be a part I'm now invested in the company, very very small minuscule amount but I'm invested in him and that idea because that idea for me is a world changing idea, all world changing ideas will not be yours you don't need them to be but if there is somebody else doing that you can either get out of the way or you can actually push them along the way or help them along the way and I genuinely feel that that is so important to do in a hyperconnected world when nobody is unreachable, you know when we wanted to get spoken I once wrote to JK Rowling she replied, she said listen currently I'm not available but I do want to come to India, great we this thing about wishful thinking there is only one life whatever you want to do here you want to learn a hundred new things you want to, it's all available, Prasoon said something very nice at a conference that we attended, he says this generation that you have given a device in which you can do everything you can even create whatever and he gave an example of a mixtape, he says you know many of us grew up as the mixtape generation, right I used to earn money in college by recording mixtapes with voiceovers in between and poetry I used to write everybody was love-loving everyone had tears in that conversation he said, you know we used to measure the exact amount of time in that tape, 45 minutes there would be a calculation you would do of saying this song is of 8 minutes this is of 6, if we add 6 and 8 and 5 and 7 then 45 will come and you would do that permutation combination and then do that recording that importance of choice and curation was so much that you curated that, you took the effort and that effort made you value that object limitless choice is killing that to a certain degree, algorithmic choices when Spotify Unwrapped came out there was a huge thing, everybody posted and then a bunch of people posted what they said, Unwrapped did not come we just said, what about natural selection, what about just going and finding something unique, what about discovering something and I am trying to do a festival around this in February next year, you know building around this entire concept but I just think that it is important and Prasoon was saying was limitless choice and the option of limitless creation he says, beside the record button there should be a bigger pause button so that you don't put up everything you think I am a little scared of the amount of problem solvers that are available on your feed of everything every well talking semi good looking person is a friend, philosopher, guide, making money when they really don't have knowledge as a base sometimes, so somewhere I think that this mass consumption, mass creation is both a solution and a problem at some level but I really feel that the world needs a lot more of curation at that level as well and before you record, before you write press that pause button and think for a bit"

        "message": "is an equally important bit. So I have a couple of questions based on that before we go back to cricket lessons and life lessons from Vikram, which is number one, of course it is a great advantage that the youth of today have the world at their fingertips, like I was just in the break I was telling Vikram about Robert Sipolsky's great biology lectures on YouTube and how we never had anything like that at our disposal in the 80s when we were in school and college but the flip side is that the mode of how you experience a world has become much more, sort of much quicker and you know, you're always swiping, swiping, scrolling, scrolling that's the mode, it's in a sense made for short attention spans, which I know of course is a cliche and people do listen to my 7 hour episodes so it's not all that but a lot of how we experience a world is in little slivers without really going deep, like Jonathan Haidt once spoke about how despite having all of knowledge available to us, all of us are consuming something that was produced in the last three days, except those listening to this episode because we are recording at the start of December and it's releasing later but you get what I'm saying so one, there is that because as a creator I have, you know, in the past written about how the form of what you're doing changes the content changes the character, so because I do 5 hour episodes or whatever I have to listen better, I have to keep my ego out of it because I'm now listening not to respond but to understand that makes me a better listener, that makes me more empathetic and it makes me a different person if I was doing 5 minute episodes it would be very different, but that's as a creator, but even as a consumer I think that applies, that if every time I was itchy and instead of reaching for a smartphone, I picked up a book and I read that for an hour, instead of scrolling through Twitter and Facebook and whatever for an hour, I think I would fundamentally be a different person right, so that is sort of one question about where the youth of today do have something tremendous at their disposal all the knowledge and wisdom of the world they are also going from immediate gratification to immediate gratification one dopamine hit after the other and the other thing is, earlier when you were talking about the youth Roshan, you mentioned about how the kids of today are evolved in different ways and all of that and I wonder if there is some selection bias in that, which has to do with essentially interacting with a certain kind of English speaking elite in a big city because, you know, India is full of multitudes in that sense and these are multitudes who are really responding to incentives and algorithms in the sense that, if today there is a 15 year old kid, he gets a video that this has happened in Bihar and a cow has been mistreated or there is an attack on a temple, and he sees one video like that, then the algorithm will make sure he sees more and more like that, till everything he is getting is from there, and the odd thing that he might hear from somewhere else seems to him to be completely crazy it doesn't fit, that would be anti-national what are you saying, you know, and then they get drawn into those echo chambers and those are possibly people that we would never come across, now both of you have travelled much more than me and you've actively worked with young people beyond, you know, whatever little urban conclaves there might be so, it's like these two questions in one really, that what is your sense of how the quality and texture of our lives is being affected by this, because I certainly think that if I, like, sure in the childhood, I didn't have all the knowledge in the world available to me, but instead of reading all the books I did, if I was scrolling on Twitter and Insta all the time, I think I would be a different person, and therefore I think this generation could be a different generation not just in terms of you know"

They are aware the person in the B and C town right now, I mean there's an amazing study that we were currently looking at which said that this is a generation of vertical invaders they are people who are going to, they don't want to stop for anything on the way, there is no, if this ladder is taking me too long, I'll find a new ladder I may not take a ladder, I might find a pole vault and I'll figure my own way up there so I think they are making their own rules, they are doing it their own way definitely yes there is the WhatsApp part is what I am scared of because I find that to be too controlled and manipulated. Twitter is really not their medium, I mean the younger lot I don't find Twitter to be their medium at all their largest consumption actually currently is on either viewing where they are viewing content so therefore they are seeing long form content, so while there is the real short form content and stuff and when I see the smaller Indian TikTok look alike I genuinely find them to be poor cousins at the moment because what that is doing is next level and there again the choices I see young people make and I am now talking other geographies as well because I travel globally as well and I interact with young people there and many of them are making choices that are very different, I mean the kindest, I saw a lot of activism happening in the Middle East which girls were doing online in smaller groups that they were building.

        "message": "I am not really sure. I will just add to that or whatever because you know I will tell you, pre-pandemic I used to come across a lot of people and one line which we used to use in common very often was that we know in a hyper connected world we are so deeply disconnected internally, you know and the fact is that your social dyslexics was in fact something that I used to turn and keep talking of saying that I met a boy who used to blog beautifully, write beautifully and when he came in person, he was not able to even talk properly and I thought that ultimately schools, colleges were a lot more about social behavior and understanding how to be around people and a lot of these people ultimately don't have that ability or whatever. The pandemic I think actually put a lens to even young people to realize a lot of this the behavior that we are seeing and I am going to talk of a completely different world, you know in the concert and going out space we were very worried that oh this behavior has changed people will want to do everything virtual or whatever complete rubbish. People are spending 5x of what they were spending before but they are a lot more conscious of their choice earlier they would have gone and said let's try 10 things experimentation has decreased, genre definition has become very strong I want to listen to independent music, I will go I want to listen to Daler Mehndi, I will listen to Daler Mehndi I want to listen to Mikka, I will listen to Mikka I will vote with my wallet and they are doing that and doing a lot more of that. In fact it's an under serviced market I believe and people are really stepping out because now they know they are lonely, yes but now they realize it also and I think that they are trying to do enough and more things frankly there should be a lot more things in that space for them to interact the one thing that people are not being able to handle is the empowerment of women women you know have changed that entire gender is a lot more aware they have a lot more opportunities and they are using them and that is creating a certain amount of problems where the coding of that middle class patriarchal coding or whatever and I mean Nikhil's episode says a lot of this, Mahima's episode talks a lot of this so we don't need to go into it in depth but that is where I still believe that there is a lot of friction and people they just don't know what to handle because the other definition which I really resonated with what Nikhil has said that if you want to do everything then why do I need to make that choice why do I only need to do engineering remember that whole bit which was there, I thought it was a lovely bit saying that you told me to make these choices because these were safe bets for earning but now you are also earning so why can't I make crazy killer bets or whatever the other thing I must tell you is that YouTube as the university for learning is a crazy phenomenon somebody who works with me, Siddhartha Garwal his family is in Nainital he has learnt everything on YouTube, his brother is the programming guy for Arijit Singh, learnt music on YouTube, not done a formal course but learnt everything there so for those who really want to learn, I think that this thing about the availability of choice now what is the use of it and this is where I have a problem this thing of becoming luddites or lotus eaters to a certain degree, sitting, sleeping not doing it when the first time I had gone to Kashmir just after mass communication I met one or two people who are very well known in the intellectual circles or whatever over tea and every evening I used to think that this world will change tomorrow morning but it didn't come in the morning then the next day the same discussion used to happen, then the next day it was groundhog day, they were just stuck in that cycle and that's the only place where I believe that if there is over consumption and you are just consuming and not acting, doing things that's the only thing that really worries me at some level but I have loads of faith in this generation, of course there is always friction, wasn't there friction when you were in college I came in from Lucknow and came to Delhi and suddenly I am standing and there is an SFI guy saying politics, decide your life, decide your politics"

I mean you look at a Hardik Pandya and I remember him seeing years back in Baroda, look at his transformation and that's what exposure can do right? Today the captain of Lucknow he's led the team beautifully because native intelligence in these guys is a lot if he gets a channel then his intelligence is way ahead of the urban intelligence so the hunger definitely is there I don't know what Ronaldo is talking about because Europe is a different ball game, in Europe no one works so maybe in his context he might be right that you know I was watching a test match in Nottingham years back and there was this English teacher sitting next to me and we were talking and I said what's happening in education and what do you teach and he was teaching in a school in Nottingham, he said how do you communicate with the young kids?

Seriously what happened is that there is an entire, remember there is a 23,000 crore economy which exists on doing the same things because at the end of the day, does the marketing director want surprises? Does the CEO suddenly want a surprise? What did you do? There are so many articles I read about where is brave new marketing? Where is the brave new campaign? Imagine the number of celebrity endorsements we see in India during an ad break. Where is the brave new ad? Where is the storytelling ad? And when you see the storytelling ad, it does brilliantly. The Google ad by Ogilvy, the Facebook ad by you know, Aggie. All of these are recent things that I remember. And then of course, just before you'll have something called a flurry of advertising. Right? And it's become like, it's called advertising season. People just keep looking for you know, I'm very sorry to say but they actually look out like that. It's horrible. But in that entire thing you're looking for, 80% of the time, I did what everyone else was doing but I did something different. What is the something different? New celebrity, you know, signed a new artist. The number of brands that have come to me saying, you know what we're doing? We're doing a brand revamp and we're doing a new music video. Okay? Why? Because you get the reach of a music video. Why? Because if you play it on T-Series, it's the maximum played YouTube channel in the world. Let's at least see this percentage, sir. This is told to you later. But did you really invest in making a unique video? Did you really get, did you get a, like I mean, there's this lovely director called Reem Sen who's been doing some fabulous work and you see her work or whatever and you know, she did that, you know, that da-da-ding, that lovely, I think it was a Puma commercial that she did or what. Brilliant. But that requires bravery when Piyush, even today, you know, you sit with Piyush, Piyush sir does so much work with us. He says, it's a two-way street. At least discuss, at least create something new. They don't want to do that. The other thing is, if you want to get into the good jobs of a marketeer, is win them an award. Because awards shine on CVs and are very good for getting your next job. Awards, our industry has made so many. I sometimes tell people saying, if you really want to value an award, don't enter so many. Nobody does it. Because everybody wants to see their name somewhere. Right? So, Kanpur, corner, you know, agency, so-and-so awards, I won. It feels good. So, I'm constantly building these safeguards around them. I believe that the brave new marketeer is returning. I'm seeing it. I'm suddenly noticing it. Don't know whether it's a post-pandemic thing. People are taking more risks. People are working with organizations. Maximum number of people advertising today in India are digital companies. Right? They are mostly digital brands. These brands have always dreamed of interacting. Firstly, they dreamt of legitimacy. In India, what's the biggest legitimacy? Standing next to a celebrity. The minute you hire a celebrity for your brand, screw what it does for the brand. The next thing that it does is, you have a picture with the person in your arm and all your relatives say, my son is Avida Bachchan's friend. Exactly."

I attend so many of these media events and then I stopped doing it recently because they said that it's the same everywhere. Same conversation, same thing, same set of people, whatever. But really, it will require a bunch of people who will break that. And they do. And again, I mean, you know, TVF has really come back. And I say that because I'm noticing it. You go and say, you know, I want a narrative like TVF. I want something like this one did. I'd like an ad that looks... Then you're... Some change is happening. It's happening with a bunch of creators. And I keep telling people, rather than put all your money behind one idea, put 50% of your money around 20 ideas. See which one is working and then pump in the media money to make it big. The remaining 50%, do whatever you want. Let people... Work with new people. This thing of working with agency of record. You know, that concept Oh, because they understood the brand, the agency invested in it. Agencies are so... I mean, they're just so broken down today into functions. So JW was known for strategy. Ogilvy was known for creative. So and so was known for media muscle. Right? The young creator today knows so much more. I keep saying that have a culture council. Have people... You know, we were chasing at Commune for a long time. We thought content, content. And pandemic, actually, because the only thing we could do was generate content. So everybody became a content company. I believe every creator is a content company by themselves. But the issue is, what kind of content and in which medium? I realize that our strongest play is live and culture. So I've turned and said, for making great content, I'll hire great people and work with them. And if I even need to put it out beyond the Commune network, I'll find you five great networks which give you efficacy and return. But in live, nobody is able to create the engagement and experience I do, which is why Commune will build far more physical IPs. In culture, because I deal with so many creators of such diverse interests, I am building culture councils and going to brands saying, come, we will be your culture. We'll be a culture lab. We will come and tell you what to do in culture. Who should be executed? No. The best person should be executed. But typical advertising behavior is, do all this with me. I'll make the song, I'll write the ad, I'll do this. It doesn't happen, boss. A lot has changed and to do that, you will need to actually spread your wings higher and ally with a lot more people. Break these big walls that you are doing or whatever. And I'm telling you, it's happening. Marketers really, and some marketers are really waking up to it. I genuinely value them. I value them by giving them more time. I value them by sending my best ideas to them, provoking"

You know, the first time they were at a balcony and a group of people were going past in the early 50s and she asked her mother, what is that? Or her grandmother, what are these people? And the grandmother said, Re-pu-jis. You know, and she repeats it like that to me 70 years later. And for me, those moments are magical when you have a person revealing themselves. Like Nikhil did so much in his episode. Nikhil Taneja, The Loneliness of the Indian Man. And I think that, for me, that's kind of special. Just listening to these and these human connections. And many of my listeners agree, you know. I'm sure I've lost some listeners because I don't do two hour deep dives into subjects, I do five hour deep dives into people. But that's just a direction that I like to go and I think that's kind of value to me. And I'm wondering if that's also something that happened with you Vikram, in the course of, as we get back to your cricket lessons, but in the course of your interacting with cricket, where at one level when you go into it, you see that these guys are almost larger than life, right? Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumle. I mean, they're just, you know, I still remember Kumle with you know, we were doing live bulletins for a test match in the West Indies where he broke his jaw and he went out to bowl with that, you know. And that makes him so much larger than life. But then you're responding to them as people and you're seeing their frailties and their weaknesses and you're learning lessons from that, which of course we'll go back to now. But what has been your sense through this time of relating to people as people? And the reason I ask that is that I think what I did when I was younger, and I don't want to generalize about whether young people do it, but I think all people do it to an extent, is that you are the center of the world, right? You are the, you're playing the lead role in the play in your head. Everybody else is a prop or a side character, but you are everything. You look at people only in the sense that they are instrumental to you or they are important for your story, but not as people themselves. And then I think what I have learnt most of all through my journey is to just have that humility and to respond to people as people, which obviously listening to their stories helps me do a lot. So how has that"

And the joy that you get unraveling people and kind of understanding their stories is exactly the joy I got in the journey of covering cricket is because when you meet people who you admire because of the nature of the profession they are in, you realize that you in your normal life are noticing people in relatively low pressure zones. But sport is, it's gladiatorial, right? You notice people in high pressure zones. And unlike your profession, that is why, what is the most exciting thing about high performance careers, right? People who are astronauts, or for that matter, mountaineers and cricketers and stuff like that, that when you unravel them, the quality of the insight is phenomenal. It just opens your mind and says, Oh, this can also happen. In normal circumstances, how much do we visualize? But when you hear a story of a cricketer or a basketball player visualizing, the impact of that concept hits you harder. So when you talk to maybe an economist or for that matter, somebody who has been a foreign secretary, you know it's a high pressure zone that the person has performed. And therefore, the higher the pressure, the more interesting the story gets. This is what I have realized. And because you love a particular sport or for that matter, a particular profession, when you start entering their world and what is our joy, right? And I think we share this thing. We like to go into other people's world. And that's why you read so many books, right? What is a book? A book basically is transporting you to a different profession, a different person, a different thought process where you are saying, Boss, if I read a book by an economist, I became an economist. If I read a book by a cricketer, I became a cricketer. So somewhere it's a voyeuristic way in which you live other people. And that's why I like autobiographies. And that's why when I went into his world and I'm saying that, Boss, I'm sitting with a guy who's actually scored the 100 100s. And now he will tell me, Boss, what happened? Now when he tells me what happened, my dopamine goes to the dope level."

One day, while collecting the ball on my left hand, when I came home, Baba said that son, come here. Your hands are not made to collect the ball. What you can see your hands are made to collect the ball. And he said for me that was a day where I felt really hurt because my cricket was being taken away from me because I loved wicket keeping. And then they had a conversation about the sound of the tabla. And then Sachin said, for both of us, sound is important. Because there is twice in the net when you get that.

When you sit on the tabla, it comes out. But when you practice so many ragas in your mind, then there is no time for you to not be in it. When you sit on a concert, your image is already there and you join it and it comes out through the tabla. So work ethic is the same thing in whose mind it goes on. Imagine Sachin Tendulkar said, yeah, you are always batting. And to me, he making one point, this guy making and he said that, you know, as a kid, I didn't know when I was stopping batting because I was always playing the ball in my head. Even Kohli talks about it. The fact that my success he says is because of the fact that I am constantly practicing. Whether you are practicing actually or practicing in your brain does not matter. And that kind of you know, this entire journey of experiencing both professions but reaching to the common goal of excellence.

He said Chapelle when did you retire? He said there was a match in Adelaide when I was in second slip. And at around 4.30 I looked at the watch. And I looked at the watch again at 4.45. 5.15 I had decided to retire. Because Martina said the human mind has the ability to focus only on one thing. It's the past, present or the future. If something is disturbing your current moment it's an area of concern. And you have to evaluate it and you know that it's not the right day. And that brings me to an amazing story of Virendra Sehwag. Everybody knows about Veeru singing. I had a chat with him one day and said what's the theory of singing? Before this I had read a very interesting book by a guy called I think John Galway. He talks about the mental state in tennis. So it's a very interesting thing. He said when you are playing tennis you will normally hear players say what are you doing? Hit the shot. I also play tennis so I know that what he is doing. So he said there are two states of play in a human body when you are playing sport. One is that self-one which is that guy who is playing tennis who has honed his skill over the years and he has allowed the body to react. So your ball is coming, you are reacting because you have learnt it. The whole system is geared to pick the ball, length, drive, play the drop shot or whatever. Now this is what is the machine. Second is a guy called self-two which is there in the body which is the mind. This is the most dangerous guy because this is the guy who is creating self-doubt in self-one and disallowing him to play. So the whole journey of a sportsman is to keep self-two away from self-one. And sledging, and my analysis is sledging is exactly to activate self-two. So the moment a batsman comes into bat and a wicket keeper says, hey mate, yesterday you couldn't take the bouncer. Will tell self-two. And the moment self-two has said boss you can't play the bouncer the entire mind will shift to the fact that you can't play the bouncer and you will get out on a bouncer. So how do you deactivate this self-doubt fellow to allow your body to be in the natural state so that it reacts to the ball at play is the entire journey of being in the moment. And that is what a sports person is trying. And now in that context, I had read this and that's why if you see what you have to do is once you play a tennis shot, tennis players are told to count the strings of the racket. This allows you to worry about the bad shot that you played and you reduce the anxiety of the next shot you are going to play. So that's the logic of being in play. So when I asked Sehwag he said, Mr. Sathe, see what happens your wicket goes between one ball and the other ball. I said, explain. He said, what happens is when I play the ball suppose I hit it on the cover point so I am thinking if the next ball comes like this Gillespie did this, he did that and I am seeing that as my thought is swinging I go and the next ball comes like this. So I asked Dravid and he said that I do deep breathing in the square leg position. So I told Dravid that I don't know how to do meditation"

On a film set and Quentin Tarantino said this, he says you know I am the Pope at the altar that you worship so in this moment main hoon Bhagwan main jo bol raha hoi hoga chahe mujhe khud nahi pata. Imtiaz has told me the same thing at times, saying that I am on the set and suddenly somebody will ask me saying ki sir my cinematography, I didn't know nothing about cinematography so often I would have a shot being done and in the middle of the shot my cinematographer would come and say Imtiaz I am thinking of doing a mid shot moving from here to here, what do you think? So I used to listen to him pause for a bit and turn and say ha sir maybe you could start a little longer because I didn't know what to tell him. Toh main karte rehte the but I couldn't show people that I don't know I would very often naively acknowledge the fact ki yaar achha tum kaise karoge and I realized that on a film set na everybody wants to make their own film and they are dying to and they will never get that opportunity so you open up that opportunity once and everyone from the gaffer to the AD to the actor to the makeup person will tell you his version of your film and that is so hyper confusing unless you are decisive so you can hear and make your decision so now shut up main kar raha hoon, yeh ek problem type tha and dhai saal, teen saal film pe kaam karne ke baad na main nichud chuka tha, mere andar se sab nikal gaya tha, koi kahani nahi bachi thi, nothing was left so when Commune started and Sathe knows this, I said every time a session happens I am richer because main das kahania sunta, main das logon ki vision se sunta and because I hear them and I don't see them I visualize them as a film so every time I would say yeh aisa hota toh, aisa ho jata hai now this has been happening from 2015 onwards roughly, 17 actively and I am now absolutely, I am now set again I have written a book which is going to be a film, writing two OTT shows but it's all because I have been so enriched by these stories that I have listened, so as you said being a great listener is a 101% something that I have actually re-picked but I feel I picked it till I was 23-24 then I implemented it for a good 15 years sab nichlo gaya, ab phir bharna shuru kara tha, did all that this being present is something that I, again recently in the play I realized because I was there, an MC acting as an actor play acting as an actor, till I realized in the first 20 days ki mere charo taraf sab actor thi, unka profession sirf acting tha, there were one or two of them who were, like Namit is a great singer and an actor and he used to have a band and everything else but everybody else was just an actor and so their craft was at another level, so the first thing was that on the 10th day or something I actually went up to Sagar and I said Sagar will you do my lines with me, and he was like kya baat kar rahe hain aap, and I said nahi nahi bhai yeh main aapko guru maan ke keh rahe hain and he was like arre Roshan bhai aap aisa baat kar rahe hain and I was like nahi, I am not joking I am not trying to chadhao you, I am being honest in telling you, this is your craft I am a learner, teach me and I said you do it, you do it, you do it and I would keep observing him and seeing this or like Sharwari was in every scene and I found her to be so and I went to her and said to me how are you so present, and then she told me this thing about saying that you know how she she uses breath and said it's not just my breath, it's your breath because we are in the air, hum dono ek hi set of hum ek hi envelope of air me se aap saas le raha hain toh agar aap zyada lenge toh mai kam lungi aur agar aap kam lenge toh, you know like it's this thing and to think of something so deeply, ek dikh khushi hoti hai to know ke kisi nein itna socha hai, phir aap usko implement karte hain, you know, there is a scene in which Lalit has just realized that the house is crumbling and he's got to make this big decision between you know, can he banish the magic child who is his cousin's daughter or does he manage to banish the brother what does he do and there was a moment and Meera kept coming to me and explaining because I was so I would perform the thing perfectly and then there was a point where I would suddenly have to say where's the scene is over and it switches the tone to where's the photographer and I would say it and she would keep saying no I'm like, I think I'm doing a great job, the scene is killer and she says see if you were present you cannot switch emotions so quickly you've just banished a man who meant everything in your life, in 3 seconds if you're saying where's the photographer you can't be all hunky dory your emotional residue would still be there and I couldn't feel it couldn't feel it, couldn't feel it, kept asking you know, I asked the other actor, asked the other actor and everybody said, tum kaise karte hai, tum kaise karte hai tum kaise karte hai, tum kaise karte hai ultimately you know, so I had to develop my own thing and I remembered this breath thing so from the point of the banishment which is about a minute and a half of a scene I start holding my breath you know, and my voice gets more constricted because saans kam hai, toh you know, wo barti jaari hai whatever, at this point I used to have to take such a deep saans that usse wo emotional change automatically aa jata tha and then when I said, where's that photographer you know, and I was still and the day I did it, she said yeah, you're there wo understanding jo hoti hai na by listening, by being present by rehearsing that craft and I just feel this, that you know, we're always a work in beta and you must believe that, you know your craft, you can only keep improving the amount I picked up you know, and I'm telling you, ever since I started listening to the podcast, then the classes then our conversations, and I'm a I'm a sponge, main wo kheechta raunga nichod uska kam nikalega, mujhe nahi pata hai"

        "message": "dopamine through various Amit, you are at least a thousand times better than me. I have had this problem since I was a child where my ability to read more than 10 minutes is not there. And I've struggled but because I've been a lazy person, this I could have won over only by discipline and routinizing, which Roshan now it comes naturally to him. So if I would have practiced, maybe today I decide to go home and I do the routine like, you know, you look at any cricketers post-match interview, it's the two words routine and process because that's the only way to come to the moment. There is no other way, right? So if we for example, you and me have to come to a point, we will have to design our life from 6 am in the morning, do that for 100 days to get that behavioral delta going and only then we will be able to get that, you know, as Gulzar says to one of my friends that irrespective of what I do in my life 8 to 12 I write. That's routine. So once you write for 4 hours every day, you might write the worst thing in the world, but on your 100th day, you'll realize that the quality is improving. But I don't reach that process. I don't do it for a day and then I don't do it again. That is purely work ethic and discipline. And the moment you do it, I have been told by people who are performing at the highest level that you will be surprised with the power of routine. And that's what Atomic Habits also talks about, right? It is just about doing that drill again and again, playing those 200 balls on a daily basis and then you are also surprised how you hit that. That's why if you see Virat Kohli after that Haris Rao shot, you see him react in that post-match interview and I do post-match, I listen to post-match interviews very clearly because it's a good representation of the state of mind of the player at that point of time. He says, I don't know how it happened, which means he's in the moment. The moment you are in the moment, that's what in sporting parlance is called a zone, where you actually are not able to think of anything and that is where your anxiety is the least. Why do people say that, boss, in the moment when you are there, then there is no anxiety and stress in your life because the past and present have been eliminated. So philosophically also, Patanjali 4000 years was trying to tell you the same thing, that if you stay on your breath, then you can't stay anywhere else. Humanly it's not possible that when I'm talking to you, I'm on Twitter. Roshan is different. But I'm saying generally for a person, one thing at a time, but you have to come to that work and look at that ball. Once Tendulkar told me that at 30th over, by the color of the ball, I could pick at what point Magra would reverse swing. And that I had done by observing how color of the ball changes. This is genius, right? I mean, how can you figure out color of the ball and the nature of the reverse swing? That comes because the guys see and there is a huge significance when the commentator says that he is seeing the ball like a football. We think that this is it. That big look means that he is in such a zone that his pupils are also dilating. And as they say when your adrenaline is high, when you come in a fighter flight, then your blood pressure improves and that's when your body is the best to react. That's why you are in that state of and I'll come to that last point of pressure, right? That the pressure handling is when the adrenaline output is the most optimum. When it is more, it means you are in over analysis. When it is less, it means you are not nervous. So at a stand-up comedian level, when I am a little nervous, that's when my best one-liners come. When I am complacent, my adrenaline is not there so I have just done this thing. When I am super nervous and I prepared so heavily, so the amount of preparation, which is process and routine also, it has to be calibrated. And that is why most sportsmen say that the best time I have performed is when I have rested well. So that combination of how much output to rest defines a good sportsperson. And my last point before the great Roshan Abbas tells his routine is the pressure point, right? That there are two perspectives of high-performance athletes to pressure. One is where they say, shit, tomorrow India-Pakistan is the game, boss. And that's nothing to do with your prowess. Whereas the other thing which you'll see Virat Kohli mentioning that I am waiting for an India-Pakistan game. Rahul Dravid would say in India when you met him after a test match, I am waiting for England to begin. Now these two perspectives define a champion. Because the moment you say I am looking for pressure, pressure does not affect you. The moment you want to run away from pressure is when you give a catch in the second, slip in the second over, knowing that this batsman could be actually better than this batsman. And that is why the greatest philosophy I have heard on pressure is Jimmy Connor's statement when he was asked, how do you deal with pressure? He said, I used to crumble under pressure. Then I made a perspective for myself and I said, when is the time when I became the richest? When is the time when I was the happiest ever? When is the time when I got the most attention? It was when I performed after a high-pressure game. Which means if I have to get rich, it means I have to be under pressure. So if there is no pressure, what a boring thing to play. So he calibrated his mind in such a way that pressure is where my incentive will be the highest. And I'll get the most return out of my profession. And he said that the only quest now was, after I had that perspective, was wait for a high-pressure game. And that is why my last submission is that you see the greatest players in the world, they don't perform in Ranji Trophy games."

        "message": "that I'm so work oriented, I've made my life so much about karma that have I somewhere started losing out on the emotional aspect of life? I'm so work fulfilled that am I fulfilled by the relationships around me? Because my work relationships, my friends extend from my work relationships only. Frankly, all the work that I do is work that I enjoy. So I don't think it is work. It is really a great environment to be in. And so maybe the other thing that happens is that in that other quotient, am I either incapable or inadequate? And this is... So after Nikhil's episode, I actually called him and said, Nikhil, give me your therapist's number. So I said, I just want to discuss this because with no therapist have I ever been able to discuss this aspect that do some of us become so well adapted in that space that we are maladjusted elsewhere. And Satya has known me so long and he knows that I genuinely try my best to give time to family and friends and you know whatever. And I really do it. There was an app I found some last year called Garden. And Garden is an app actually which says almost how to nurture your relationship. So it says it allows you to divide people into family, friends and business. And then accordingly it allows you to set reminders when to connect with them. So automatically it will do family once a week, friends say you know once a fortnight, business maybe once a month and you can keep varying that. And I used it for 2-3 months and I realized that I do it automatically. I stay in touch with these three networks. I call my parents every morning. My son is in America. I normally wait for him to get in touch with me or whatever because I know he is in that phase where I was in college that I didn't want to be in touch with anyone. And I am okay with it. Shaheen is not. Aayital you know is 15. Whenever, whatever I can do, I do or whatever as I said there are lots of topics that I might end up discussing with her because we are trying to lead this two country life at the moment and I have just been taught this new thing about a three flag life which is can you chase the season of your choice across three countries which is the best life to lead. But then it is a nomadic life and I am okay with a nomadic life. I think somewhere we are still struggling with the fact that we are in two countries nowadays we are spending a lot of time where Shaheen is running her business there, I am here or whatever. And we have been a very very close family overall even otherwise. Now with age you are realizing that there is all of these aspects and sometimes I have been just trying to understand that is it a man thing? That we are more work oriented and are we emotionally a little dissonant? Are we always brought up not to show our emotions so often? For example I cry at a patriotic film but normally most other things do not make me cry at all. And again I am saying all this because otherwise my work routine and ethic is very clear. I wake up really early, I normally get up with my daughter in the morning so that I can see her for that one hour before she goes to school. She is very grumpy on certain days and I tell her listen I am waking up an hour before just to be with you. Please at least try to be happy. And then she says it's not you, it's me. And I was like I understand and she has found it. So there are days when she will give me that happy radiant smile and hug me and whatever. And there are days when she will sort of just slink out of the door as if somebody was the cat is dragging out. But it's that or whatever. I then because nobody else wakes up really early I get those two hours with myself. Which is when I am doing all my browsing, gallivanting, portals, going into trap doors, new worlds and I just do that. I don't note all of it down or whatever as it were. Right after that in the morning with breakfast and if I can I try to work out three times a week. Sometimes I will do five days. If I am in Dubai I will just go and cycle for 15 kilometers while listening to you half the time at 1.5x which now I have managed to get to 1.5. And I know that my 15 kilometers in mean that it will take me 45 minutes. And in those 45 minutes I have almost covered two hours of the podcast. So I have done half. Then I try and do it the next day and that's one routine that I follow. After that I have got these two calls that are normally scheduled. One with my internal team. So which is my left brain, right brain and I say I have to do this today. Very often I don't need to do that call because they now know it so well that they know and they will just tell me what to do. Then the rest of the day normally will end up being things that I have to engage with. So for three months when I was doing the play I had just changed that entire day. But I informed everybody saying guys I will be sporadically available in this time. And because the biggest commitment at that time was spoken I had also just given up on Encompass which was my event company and I exited it 100%. People were like oh my god but that was you and the umbilical cord and I said no. I had sold the company in 2008. You know I was taking care of it externally. I don't need to anymore. At some point we need to cut this umbilical cord and I did it and whatever and now the decision is WPPs are they continuing or not continuing their life or whatever. There's a bunch of people I mentor and I don't think I'm only mentoring them. There's a lot of times that I'm just listening to them and getting. So whether it's a Pooja who's a very dear friend and who was running Glitch or whatever Varun is there Nikhil I consider more. And again I will not say these are all mentees. These are all people I love to interact with because our work intersects and stuff and there's a host of these people you know. I spend time with all of them. Occasionally then I like to take a little snooze if I can in the afternoon doesn't happen more often than not but if I can take that half an hour siesta I think that thing beats it. I'm a tea addict. I have 4-5 cups of tea. I've had 4 with you. And that's how it continues and then I like to engage with a certain amount of you know that famous book The Artist's Way had two things. One which Sathe in fact said that do something and do it continuously so with her it was morning pages. I did morning pages after the film just to break that block and it did help me. I did morning pages after clear writing as well. And again that really helped me because that's how I got a lot of work done I think. But there's a beautiful thing in that which says you know date an art form and I try to do that. Like yesterday I really wanted to go to the Thespo festival that's happening at Prithvi because I wanted to see Sun Behen because it's a very good play. I couldn't see it but I will do something or whatever. So I think this is how I try and break up my normal routine is this. Earlier I would say yes to a lot of just random meetings. I have filtered that down so people I was so and I'm normally very very polite so I don't normally tell people say fuzz off. There's a simple way of knowing if I'm interested or not now which is that if I give you a reply which is a that means if I give you a reply I'll say which means if I give you a definite yes or no then I'm into it. My spheres of work and again I don't call it work because I want to make a film, I want to write a book, I want to grow the commune, I have started experiences in Dubai I have started a company, I will extend it to India because again I feel that there are really no quality experiences and the more I see them the more I realize the gap and I want to fill all of that and I think this is pretty much what we do. Shaheen makes sure that in the year we get enough breaks, we have enough time to connect with family and stuff and whatever. She is the love laughter fun department in many of these things and honestly I think she is a lot more emotionally grounded but this is an area which currently I'm trying to explore because I find this to be somewhere an area which either I'm under servicing or is it truly under serviced in people like yours is the thing that I don't have an answer for but otherwise this is the way I sort of exist I have a few goals that as I told you that when I discover like I mean see for example this whole a few money goal was a very clear 10 million dollars, I mean I was very clearly told it's a 10 million dollar goal or whatever etc. I think I achieved it. Yeah and it's fine it's not liquid. In an ideal FU you know money thing, it should be liquid. It's not that, I didn't make that much liquidity but I have made properties, houses nobody is you know there's no hand to mouth, you can make your choices or whatever you want to do. The F off which I recently discovered in Dubai because Dubai is now filled with billionaires and billionaires and whatever. I try to avoid one or two of those circles because it unnecessarily creates it exists as Sathe said some of these networks exist on a mere paas yeh hai, tumhare paas kya hai kind, which I hate as a conversation I don't understand anything. If you want to share then it's a very good thing let's do this together, I have such friends they are billionaires but they are like let's do this together which is great, it doesn't come from a place of privilege, it comes from a place of let's do this together and that could be sitting together on a ukulele and singing stupid songs while having wine and it could also be going and seeing a play together or doing something you know to a certain degree but I just find that this three flag life concept is something I currently find very intriguing right, when somebody said that if winter is your favorite season would you not be able to want to chase winter through the year and if you could you'd be living in the season of your choice, that is F off level, what's F off I am choosing my season, so what's a F off number, so I was told it's about 25 million USD"

Toh Bawaraj shuru hua, Krishna Patil, actually bahut emotional story thi, ki Shantanu aur hum log baithe the, toh Krishna ko poocha ki kaise lagta hai to be on Mount Everest. He said I climb Mount Everest and when I looked down, I said how am I going to repay this loan? Because she had been given loan by I think Saraswat Bank to the extent of 30 lakh rupees, very expensive to climb Everest. So that kind of you know, I said that you know, after climbing Everest, if you are worried about how to repay the loan, then we got to do something. And that got me thinking as to what we should be doing and we said chalo let's start with a Bawaraj concert. And we did that concert at Rang Sharda. I got Aditya Birla to fund that concert and all the money, thankfully we had Roshan supporting on the console."

Probably the Andhra government had given him all the infrastructure but running costs and all is not easy to build so many champions. So Gosports said that can you do an event.

fact but the idea was it's a festival of creative curiosity and everybody said you know what 2-3 people who worked with me said whatever you have to do at home, you expand it and make it a festival but this need to satisfy curiosity to a large degree and creatively because you know when you make a little bit of money you get approached by so many of these funds and everybody who comes and says sir I will make it 100 I say sir you can't give me a return which my brain gives my brain makes 0 into 100 so you can never get that multiplier right, where does that multiplier come from that multiplier comes only when you go out and find new things to do now I am a child when it comes to learning and I have childlike enthusiasm about these things so this year it had started with me after Dubai when we did one or two concerts and actually I spent a lot of time with Veer and Veer has a lot to do so the day we were doing the Veer Das event the first day unfortunately his excellency the head of Abu Dhabi passed away and they in the day it happened and by the evening they said no shows will happen and we had already said we won't do an event so Veer came home and we were talking and then in conversation he was telling about the television show he is making and about his New York special and I mean the most amazing story about Chris Rock where he went to the Comedy Central performance place in New York and he said you know I was there and I was going to perform and they had about 5 performers with 5-10 minute slots and they said you got a surprise act for the rest of the evening and suddenly they came and said guys we are knocking off all the acts before because Chris Rock is performing and he is going to come and Chris Rock is legend in life he said ultimately I went and I was like you know they said will you just introduce Chris Rock so he went and he did the 5 minute set before Chris Rock and then when it finished they said will you also close so he went and did it so he said you know I closed for Chris Rock so his wife was sitting there and he said no he opened for you and I love Veer's the same thing about Veer his bias for action and his ability to keep doing new things so while talking like this he said Edinburgh Fringe is happening, let's go and I have always wanted to go to the Fringe and every year I have had this thing because August used to be work time and kids used to come back from vacation so I said I am going to go for a fact and I went for 10 days when I was there I saw so much experimental theatre I saw 21 shows in 7 days I had a backpack I used to get up at breakfast and go you can't pre book and I stood in lines for 2-2 hours humbling experience, you are meeting waiters who are trying stand up comedy from New York who have flown down to do their experimental set a girl who is 19 who has written her first play and been called somebody who has been their thespian for 30 years standing on the road and distributing his tickets it is for any creator you have to go to a Fringe just to experience this madness of a city coming alive with the arts I think somewhere there in my head this wanting to get back to theatre became a big urge but not any play because I have been offered a lot of plays to do here in Bombay but I was like whatever I had to do here I did it because honestly after doing Aladin and a lot of other things I was like what will I do after this I did Prithvi, I did single play I did Aladin, I wrote and suddenly this call happened from Dilip Shankar and he said Roshan they are looking for somebody to do this and I called Amol who sort of manages my work at Commune and many other artists and he was like sir three months and that is when the first big thing was three months, two months in Bombay and this was premiering at the World Cup at Doha because it was part of the Qatar Creates thing and then we were told that next year which is in April, May it will go off Broadway which is the process you go off Broadway then producers come then if they selected then it goes on Broadway then there will be an India tour and a global tour and the way Meera has lived with this story ever since the film was made and the play has happened twice before but in smaller avatars, so Berklee they did a show where Javed Jafri played Lalit and Javed is a very good dancer but you know sings and is also so he was there and Namit was there from that show only and Sharwari was there and many other actors I think at that point in time Ali Sethi was being considered for something as a role and beautiful so they did shows there for 6 weeks, it was a housefull show that I had heard of the script was still evolving then in 2019 they did Delhi, they did 12 shows again completely new and with theatre, unless you are in a resident theatre space the play changes to adapt to the place and Qatar was going to be a revolving stage, LED screens it was Meera's biggest vision and therefore the fact of being part of that vision, being part of a film that I had loved to watch and experiencing the triple threat, as I said acting singing, I could do that, I had to do dance as well and it was clearly told and I was also told by you know Meera's partner, he came and he said that Roshan, we are treating this as an ensemble cast which means that while you might be playing a very significant role, there will be other scenes where you might be playing a PM and walking on with a suitcase and whatever, are you comfortable with that I said I don't have anything like that so I said I don't mind, let me see if I fit in, so I did the audition, I was by myself in Dubai, there was no one there, I called my friend who used to act with me in theatre 25 years ago in Lucknow, who came, we did a printout of the script, he sat opposite and read the lines, I did a decent audition, then with the songs I had to sing, I took 2-3 extra days learned the songs, my daughter reviewed them online and passed them saying ya it's decent, and I did that, and that's when I, there was a song which is towards the end I'll just tell you, so it has the original line"

Or Malaika Arora's clothes are not ready backstage. Or the dancer is not here. Or the lights are not on. Send me to Roshan Mas. I have to handle the boss. I don't know how long. I don't know. I don't know means. Because Jekyll and Hyde is me doing Jekyll and Hyde. In as many singers as possible. If I have heard the singer. People respond to the tune. Because sometimes the tonality obviously I don't end up getting. But they respond to the tune. If I can do it. And the story used to be that you know. Just like the stars are gathered in this hall. So it would be at a conference. Or if it's a show. All these lovely people are gathered in this hall. Just like that once there was an auditorium. Which was filled with a great audience. But there was another auditorium unfortunately next to it. Which was filled with children. And all these musical stars had to go and collect their awards. At this galaxy of stars. But they ended up at the children's auditorium. And when the curtain went up. And they said boss we are entertainers. And we have to entertain. So the children don't know our lyrics. But they must know Jekyll and Hyde. So we will come in our own style and perform Jekyll and Hyde. So I will say 2-3. After that you can request. So various singers. And Vikram you can always give us your requests. As we go along. So the first person who got up to do Jekyll and Hyde was Elvis Presley. And Elvis reached up on stage. And this is what he did."

But if it is to young people at large, as I said that there is a lot of hope we all have in this generation for the simple reason that remain unafraid, keep experimenting, keep doing. You know, in this digital ether, in this digital world, that virtual like, that virtual heart, that virtual share is a small dopamine hit maybe for you and for others around you. But if it doesn't get translated into action, it's a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing almost by the end of it. If you really want to go, there is no better, there is no generation which will be as empowered as you, no generation that will have as many tools as you, no generation where the ability to break down all those old guardrails, you know, all those guardrails you can break so easily. We had to knock on doors of All India Radio, stand outside film studios, read 20 scripts, do auditions, do all of those things. And I did a very small share of it, but then thankfully the success was incremental. But do that. Also in the initial years, work for experience, not for money. I know this sounds very easy from where I'm sitting today. But I can tell you about 50% of the jobs I did in my first seven or eight years of working, and maybe even more than that, were done for experience, not for money. They gave me all the skills I have to make the money. They gave me all the bad experiences in small doses, not being paid, not signing contracts, being cheated, being stood up at an event, having to suddenly, you know, see be replaced by another person, all of those things. Everything, those small hurts, because till the age of 25, maybe your brain is still learning how to process and how to react and respond to things. Delve into as many experiences as you can. Life is there to make money. Don't fall for this trap of money today, money today. Don't look at only the success charts. I genuinely feel that there needs to be a failure slash stumbling chart as well. And every stumble is a learning. Go for those, because there is so much to do that. Along the way, don't forget the people who build you, ever. Don't forget your family, ever. Because in the end, they will be around you. Whatever you do. I'm going to end with a line that I just heard in Tathastu from Zakir, because I absolutely adore it. He turned and said, professional loss is temporary. Personal loss is permanent. Just make sure that you give enough time to those. And there's another line from his show. I think he's a soothsayer for this generation to a large degree. He says, don't ruin anyone's magic. There's no need. Be gentle. Everybody has had a bad day. Everybody's done that. If you can, if you can find that empathy within you, that's all that everybody needs. Beautiful words."

        "message": "Amazing. Don't ruin it. One thing I've learned is don't give advice to youngsters. Actually, they may not take it. But having said that, I would have taken Roshan's advice to myself if I was young, is that I don't want to change anything, especially my mental state and the fact that I live without any goal and stuff like that. But still, I'm curious enough to, I think curiosity is the fundamental thing. If you're curious, a lot of your anxieties, your stress kind of gets canceled because you are anyway in the moment. You're trying to seek out of life and others. And I would have taken one piece of advice from Roshan to my younger self, that yes, you live the life that you have chosen to in the way you are doing right now, but just get a little more execution friendly and put out more creative in the universe so that, and take it to the logical conclusion and just don't get away from it. Beyond that, nothing."

        "message": "Yeah, I would just say that I disagree with you in the one sense. In the context of my own life, that I would do things differently. I would do a lot differently. And I think my advice comes from there. Advice number one is respect the passing of time. Time passes quicker than you know it. You know, there's a saying, the days are long, the years are short. The years go by before you even realize how fast they are moving. So respect that time. Don't waste any of it. I would also say bet on yourself, right? If you grow yourself. Kids today are so fortunate, not just kids, we today are so fortunate that we live in a world where you can learn anything. You can go online and you can pick up any skill and become good at it. So respect time, bet on yourself. You know, compound yourself, as Sam Altman says. You know, always try to figure out ways in which you are getting better at something and ask yourself every day, every week, what have I learned this week? How am I better? Also, look within yourself for happiness, not outside. I think too many people spend too much time worrying about what other people think of them, where really nobody's thinking of anybody else. We've all got our heads up our own asses, right? So just, you know, look within for happiness. Validation doesn't really matter. And the words from James Clear and Atomic Habits sort of ring really true to me when he says everything you do today will impact your future self. And I think that's supremely important. You know, I'm very angry at the young me because he didn't compound himself and he wasted too much time. And I think that impacted his future self. And what I think we all have to remember is that everything you do today builds the person you are tomorrow. Think of that person. Be compassionate towards him. And this doesn't mean that you work, work, work all the time. Leisure is also great. Being in the moment is great. Listening to a piece of music and giving into it and not looking at what your calendar says is also great. But the point is that overall, you've just got to sort of think about that. You know, there are many ways. Like one good metric is that if you think of your ideal self, what is the perfect version of you doing that you don't do? And what is a perfect version of you not doing that you do? And if you just, you know, do a journal entry. And in fact, writing a journal every day is also great advice that I would give. And I would say that, you know, make that your first journal entry and write about, you know, that ideal self. You know, what are they doing that you are not and what are they not doing that you are doing? And I think they would also listen to this podcast. So it's fine. Basically, what you're saying is find your own Baljeet. Find your own inner Baljeet and make him your Bhayna."

But if you get a little meaning that you have to do this, then I have seen that psychological issues are also solved a lot, which are likely to come in the younger generation. For that matter, even just, I mean, to this thing, even when my mother was unwell, when I, she has lived her life, she has taught me the things. But the moment I triggered that, you know, you should do this and that will this thing, suddenly her healing process got better. I know, I don't mean to say the why is a very philosophical construct about your existence in the universe, but it is that small, that I should do this, that kind of solves a lot of problems before."
