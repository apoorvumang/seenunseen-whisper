        "message": "The Economist magazine coined this phrase in 1977 in the context of the Netherlands, which had a stroke of good fortune when natural gas was discovered in Groningen in 1959. Or was it really good fortune? Because of this natural resource, foreign exchange flooded into the country and their own currency became stronger. This meant imports became cheaper and people could now afford the best goods from across the world. As a result of this, the local manufacturing sector went into decline. What initially seemed like good luck, later appeared to be not quite so lucky after all. A classic modern case of the Dutch disease is Venezuela. Large reserves of oil were discovered there more than a century ago in 1914, and a relatively poor country, suddenly sitting on humongous oil reserves, became quite rich as the years went by. But what this also did was that it lowered the incentives for the governments that ran the country to learn the good habits that take a nation towards prosperity. There was so much oil wealth that governments quickly developed patterns of patronage and cronyism. Bad governance and poor economic policies did not have the cost they should have because there was always so much oil wealth floating around. In a situation like this, sooner or later, something always has to give. Venezuela is now going through an enormous humanitarian crisis, caused by bad economics but enabled by the bonanza of oil. I'll explore some of that in this episode, but before I do, here's a thought. Does the same process by which too much of a good thing can be bad for countries, can it also be bad for individuals?"

So you learn to be rigorous with your facts. You learn to check with sources. You learn to question everything. You learn to be fair. Of course, all these issues are deeply philosophical, and we can debate them at great length because there's no perfect recipe for it. But especially, I think, as a foreign news outlet in countries where sometimes the local media is coward or doesn't have the resources to cover something as well as it would have otherwise, you become a frame of reference.

Your job is to open the curtains and tell readers what's going on. Now, that's a clean-cut example. In the real world, it can get muddier than that. But I think trying to find the sweet spot between being fair to the different sides and ideas involved, but also, you know, not just being a robot who's throwing out the facts coming from different sides and actually assessing how the situation is evolved, how politicians or whoever's claims stake up to what they've actually done is in essence an essential part of our job."

Venezuela has rampant corruption. We know that is one of the fundamental reasons this government has been so inept and has basically left Venezuela penniless. For a long time, it was very difficult for us to say that. We knew money was disappearing, but if you don't have the proof, you don't write it if you're a rigorous journalist. Of course, now there are multiple cases across the United States and in Europe where, you know, a single businessman has been accused and has pleaded guilty to embezzling, say, a billion dollars. That gives you an idea of the scale of graft we're talking about. But for a long time, it can be frustrating because to be a rigorous reporter, you can't just throw around baseless claims, but that also means you're missing a fundamental part of the story that you're struggling to tell the readers, and I think that's the deepest frustration there can be."

So after Chile, which is a much kind of more dour, closed society, it was a treat for me to just go out and be able to interview people in the supermarket lines and have them genuinely tell me about their lives and their sufferings. Because they wanted to, they wanted to be heard, and that's the way they are. Conversely, the government is fairly shut off. At the time, we still had the occasional press conference. Sometimes they would answer questions, but it was the kind of situation where GDP, inflation, crime data, emigration data, none of that was being published anymore. As you mentioned at the start of the podcast, I covered oil, and that meant covering the big, omnipresent state oil company. I spent four years in Venezuela, and I genuinely don't think they ever answered one of my questions. You know, when you're writing a story, you send in a request for comment by phone or by email to give the person concerned a chance to respond, and I never got a single answer to my emails. I mean, it's that kind of black hole situation you're talking about. So it forces you to be a kind of creative, enterprising reporter to get to the stories, which always means you're missing a significant chunk of data and the government side.

So tell me a little bit about how Venezuela got here, you know, starting from before Maduro, like when Maduro was president, starting from maybe even before Ch\u00e1vez, like a lot of people lay the blame quite correctly for what's going on to the bad economic policies in Ch\u00e1vez's time, which have continued with Maduro.

So Venezuela was, by some metrics, one of the richest countries in Latin America where this elite, this filthy rich would travel to Miami and famously say, give me two of everything, it's so cheap. Of course, that fueled a lot of inequality and discontent and a sense that the political establishment, which was basically two political parties that would rotate power through democratic elections, but rotate power amongst themselves, wasn't representative. And there had been sporadic violence and turbulence in the country for a long time. And Ch\u00e1vez, who came from a poor family from the Savannah lowlands, really spoke to the people who felt marginalized by the system. And because Venezuela is an oil rich country, there's this idea that we are a rich country. We should not be poor. This something has gone wrong and someone is to blame for it. And Ch\u00e1vez diagnosed that problem brilliantly, as many populists do, and was elected in 1998. There was immediate virulent opposition to him from the elite in media and politics, etc. And that culminated in a series of marches in 2002 that led to a brief coup against him, where he was deposed for three days. It remains a very complex, fiercely argued about episode about exactly what happened to him. Ultimately, he was reinstated by military loyalists. And after that, some would say, he became much more paranoid about any attempts against him and clamped down much more on institutions, the press, and any opposition he could see."

And Ch\u00e1vez detected that correctly and got to power. But what I always find kind of interesting is that for the first five or six years of his time, he professed himself to be non-ideological, where he said, I'm not a communist, I'm not a capitalist, even though, I mean, he had communist influences.

And then they have these 50-50 arrangements where they get, share 50% of the profits with the state. And then that tilts further to the state. And then it's Venezuela, which actually forms OPEC. So all the power goes to the sort of \u2013 that actually pushes for the formation of OPEC. So all the power goes to the states rather than the companies. And then gradually that in the mid-'70s leads to the formation of the state oil company PVDSA. So tell me a little bit about the role oil played in politics through the decades."

You mentioned the Dutch disease, and that impeded Venezuela from having enough efficient industry and agriculture, although it did have those sectors in the 70s and 80s. But Ch\u00e1vez's big criticism was that the foreign companies were getting too sweet a deal in Venezuela under the former governments. And so very quickly, when he comes to power, he understands that PVDSA, the state oil company, will be crucial to his fortunes. And, in fact, the lead-up to the coup, there's a strike by PVDSA workers and engineers against Ch\u00e1vez. So they bring the oil industry to a standstill, which again shocks the oil market and completely attacks the Venezuelan economy. And ultimately, as we know, Ch\u00e1vez prevails, and he absolutely purges the state oil company. And so all these engineers who supported the opposition and walked off their jobs are fired. There's huge turnover. A lot of these people incidentally ended up immigrating to Colombia or Canada and helping basically create the Colombian oil industry, so benefiting other countries. And gradually, over time, PVDSA becomes a fiefdom for Chavismo. For a long time, it maintains operational capacity, even though it's highly indebted, inefficient, and corrupt, but it still kind of has the veneer of a functional company. But throughout my time there, you just saw it close off. And in the last year, Maduro put a general in charge of the state oil company because the military is absolutely the other kind of crucial part to understanding Venezuela. And generals have been sweetened by all these deals that Maduro's offered them, you know, mining stakes, control over imports, and the oil industry, which is the crown jewel, as a way of rewarding them for their loyalty and ensuring that they continue to be loyal to him. And it's led to an exodus of your low-level workers who are already unable to eat three square meals a day because they're just earning a handful of dollars a month. Of course, you know, any engineer or chemist has fled because they're not earning anything more. They're often working in dangerous refineries that haven't had proper maintenance work in years and are a big threat. And it's also actually very dangerous out in the oil fields because large parts of Venezuela are essentially lawless. And you're very exposed to theft and gangs looking to rob copper or rob you in the oil installations. So the whole industry is completely unraveled, which is a huge threat for Maduro given that more than 90% of the income, the country, comes from oil now because all the other industries have fallen by the wayside. And now, with the new sanctions from the Trump administration, it's getting even harder for him to export oil. So yet again, oil will be one of the big deciding factors"

But when I arrived, first of all, your bank card doesn't work. No foreign cards work. You could take money out but at an extraordinarily unfavorable rate so you'd be getting a dollar out, effectively getting what's worth a dollar on the black market but spending maybe $50 for it in your bank account. So what someone like me or others get is a middleman, right, who you wire money to from your bank account abroad to his bank account abroad and then he wires bolivares from his account to your account in Venezuela and that allows you to navigate the system. But it creates an enormous amount of distortions. So, for instance, for a long time, foreign airlines priced their airfare in local currency but at the pegged official rate. So that meant people could fly literally from Caracas to London for the equivalent of $40 if they were buying their currency on the black market, right? So it was a free-for-all. It was this bizarre distorted party that people were taking care of. Of course, someone has to pick up the bill and foreign airlines are now owed a total of about $4 billion because the Venezuelan government never then reimbursed them as promised. So that's the kind of distorted magical realism side of it. The real-world impact of it is that nothing worked, right, because what you're supposed to trust, which is money, which has a certain value and creates trust and creates your chain, was completely distorted. So things just didn't function. Importers wouldn't import because they wouldn't have access to the official currency because that was reserved for cronies and so had to go to the black market rate if they could afford it and then pass that cost on to customers. If not, they folded shop. So that was really the deathblow to the Venezuelan economy, the incredible distortions in the currency."

And one of the things that I realized was, one, that inflation has been a common part of Venezuela for decades, not just a Chavez issue.

It's wild, and it's really the only thing people talk about because it is such a disorienting and life-destroying phenomenon. It destroys your salary. It's as if you walked into a supermarket tomorrow and a sack of rice was priced at 18,000 rupees. How can you talk about anything else? It's your livelihood. It's everything you thought was stable that is being cut out from under you. And what's particularly fascinating about this spate of hyperinflation is that it seems to be the first one of the digital age. So Venezuelan government can't even print enough physical money to keep up with the money it's creating in general. So there's a perennial shortage of bills. So prices are going up all the time, but no one has any physical money, which is insane because it's not the kind of wheelbarrow image you have of hyperinflation, right? So what does that mean? That means every ATM you walk in front of has tens of people queuing up at any given time hoping to get a few bills out, even though the maximum is about $2 that you can take out of the ATM."

So there literally were times where I could not pay for something. I obviously had the money in my account. I wanted to pay for it, but nothing worked. I had no bills. The power system was down.

So what happens is when a government decides that it needs to up its spending or pay back its debts or whatever and it starts printing money, the amount of money relative to goods and services just goes up and therefore you have more money chasing the same number of goods. So obviously supply and demand, the goods and services out there become more expensive. And if you just keep indiscriminately printing money, this just gets worse and worse till it spirals to, you know, unmanageable proportions till, you know, what you used to buy a house with. One year later you buy a loaf of bread with that and the poor are most hurt by it. But what kind of surprises me is that despite a lot of this happening for even the early, since the start of Chavez's regime in a sense, he had popular support for a much longer time than you would have. I mean, is that because people disconnect what is happening to them from the economic policies that a government carries out?"

So he said that all the economic woes were to do with an economic war being waged against him and Maduro's government, right? So the evil businessmen are stockpiling goods, the evil businessmen are upping prices in a speculative manner to ruin your life, etc. And, you know, hyperinflation is an abstract concept and it's not that easy to understand. And if the government dominates the airwaves and you don't have a background in economics, or perhaps not a background in anything because you weren't able to pursue your education, it's actually much easier to blame a speculator. And once the situation became really difficult in Venezuela and we had those hundreds of people banging on supermarket doors, demanding food, which happened all the time, you had the creation of these men called bachakeros, which is actually a name that derives from ants that can carry a lot on its back, which is lovely poetry, but in practice was terrible, right? So these men who queue up, buy up products that they then resell at a heightened price, right? Because not everyone can stand in line all day waiting for food. They have to get to work and some of them do have disposable income to pay more. So it's a lot easier if you're poor, stuck in line for hours, waiting to buy a pack of pasta, and you see these bachakeros slip in line in front of you, threaten you, buy up the products, and then you see those same products on your street corner the next day for five times the price. Well, who's to blame? The bachakeros, right? Of course, bachakeros don't exist in countries where you have enough supply and you don't have controls, but that's harder to remember when you're in the thick of it and you want to survive.

But, you know, not cut out to be a president. So he takes on the approach of, Chavez was loved. I was designated to be his successor. Therefore, I shall not tweak any of his policies. And he stands firm, you know, backing these increasingly ludicrous and destructive policies as Venezuela's economy utterly unravels. And there starts to be increasing pressure for, look, you have to devalue, you have to let private investment in, you have to start to lift the currency controls, you have to increase gasoline prices, and Venezuela has the cheapest gasoline prices in the world. It's essentially free. Another one of the wild distortions of this magical realist place. But Maduro does not do any of that. So progressively the situation just spirals entirely out of control.

Cancer patients couldn't find their oncological medicine anymore. Even people who had successfully overcome things, like gotten a transplant for a failed organ and were living and happy suddenly couldn't find the medicine they needed to help stop their organ from being rejected. So just the humanitarian crisis balloons. And Maduro and his acolytes just dig in, essentially ignore reality. They both ignore it and blame it on the opposition without ever kind of acknowledging how dramatic it's gotten. They undeniably live in a bubble. They limit their outside interaction with the people. Everything is very choreographed and stage managed. And, you know, it's gotten to a point of no return where it's so difficult to reform the economy now unless you have a major bailout. Because anything you would touch could be dynamite, right? If you lift currency controls now or something, it could just completely destabilize and wreck the country in the short term. And they don't have the economic know-how or the wherewithal to do that. So he's just dug himself into a complete hole."

But they left, you know, they took a plane, they had their money, they settled in Miami and Madrid and continued being doctors or engineers. It was sad, of course, but their life went on and they're doing well. But what happened under the Maduro government is the poor people suffered the worst. The poor and the middle class that got thrown into poverty because of hyperinflation and the general economic situation. And initially a lot of them left by bus or short-haul flight to the rest of Latin America. But increasingly what we're seeing is dirt poor people just walking across Latin America to as far as they can,"

And for most of Chavez's governance, much of the rest of South America was also ruled by the left wing. It was very cozy with Chavez and in some instances possibly benefited from his oil largesse or just private funds for campaigns. So there's very muted criticism of him. Over time that pink tide, as it was called, has ebbed over Latin America with the commodities price crash. So now actually you have a string of right wing governments. Still there was wariness about confronting him directly but the fact that so many migrants and refugees were spilling into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Chile and because the situation has deteriorated in terms of human rights and democracy so much in Venezuela those countries have spoken out. But there is still this unease with having the US lead the charge. And for a long time at least under Obama, the US administration was pushing Mexico or Brazil regional powerhouses to lead, to avoid having the US be at the forefront because the US has had a track record of supporting dictators or even coups in Latin America during the Cold War and there's a huge amount of resentment against the United States for that and that helps explain the rise of people like Chavez. I think now because Latin America is dominated by the right and because there's so much sense of such urgency"

Bush in very funny and amusing ways, I'm not going to quote any of that but some great quotes Google it, although he kept ranting about the imperialists and the neoliberals and the Americans and so on when it came to oil, it was business as usual.

Chavez was clearly problematic for institutions from the start but the opposition would be wildly exaggerating what was happening and lose credibility in the process so by boycotting the elections and saying this wasn't a democracy and Chavez is the dictator when I think a lot of political scientists would say he wasn't, he had autocratic tendency but it wasn't a dictatorship. They actually facilitated his road to creating a much more authoritarian government Over time the opposition has done some soul searching and Enrique Capriles who was a two time presidential candidate for the opposition actually said no we cannot demonize Chavistas Chavez supporters we must talk to them, understand why they voted Chavez and show them why we're the path forward so he actually did crisscross the country go into the slums and the poor villages and talk to people and won over a lot of them not enough to win the election"

It's been a whirlwind since January so Maduro was sworn in for his second term in January after a very again a decried election where all the Western powers said this was a fraudulent vote and everyone kind of expected it to be game over after that but then this new kind of fresh-faced opposition leader, Juan Guaido who had just become the head of the Venezuelan congress which is still led by the opposition and incidentally he became head of the congress because most of the people or many of the leaders in his party are either in exile in prison or holed up in the embassy so he was kind of the last person standing and no one expected him to become the face of the rejuvenated opposition so Juan Guaido was 35 swore himself in citing the constitution, his constitutional right to do that and declared himself president and that just set in motion a whole chain of events the US supported him, other European countries and Latin American countries also recognized him, it sparked a huge wave of protests and we thought the Venezuelan people were kind of broken, right? Immigration was the way out, everyone has just lost hope that anything could ever change and almost overnight it seems that people took to the street with renewed hope there was hope in the US and amongst the opposition that the military would immediately defect and support Guaido that did not happen the military in Venezuela is essentially an extension of the government, it has control over whatever lucrative business is left in the country. Plan B was to try to force in humanitarian aid so we had a standoff at the Venezuelan border a few days ago where the opposition tried to drive in these trucks full with food and the Venezuelan soldiers blocked them and there were confrontations, tear gas and Molotov cocktails etc, but it failed there was a number of defections, an increasing number of defections from rank and file soldiers, I think we're at about over 500 now, which is interesting and it's increasing every day, it's not a groundswell and we're not talking about the big fish, but it's something to monitor. Guaido left Venezuela to see the aid through from Colombia and is now in Brazil, meeting the president there. He's vowed to come back to Venezuela but Maduro has said there was a travel ban on you, if you return you shall be detained. So there's a big question there and possibly"
