Too much of my commentary on the show in recent times has been all gloom and doom. But what to do that is indeed the state of our nation and our economy and our governance today. So I thought I'd do an episode where I get some of the sharpest thinkers I've had on the show to get together and propose what I term dream reforms. I have three guests on the show today, a record, and each of us will propose three dream reforms that we'd really love to see. And so will I. So that's a total of 12 dream reforms, each of them proposed by one of us but discussed by all of us. My guests today are Vivek Kaul, Shruti Rajagopalan and Rajeshwari Sengupta. I take their names in this order, because I am grouping them by the frequency of their appearances on the scene and the unseen. Vivek has appeared on a whopping 16 episodes of the show. And I'm beginning to think that he and I should just get a, not get a room but a separate show of our own so others get a chance on this one. Watch this space. Shruti meanwhile has appeared on 11 episodes of the scene and the unseen and was delighted to get an invite in this episode so she could catch up with Vivek till she realized he was also on it. Tough luck Shruti. Rajeshwari has appeared just once on the show. But Sachin Tendulkar had played just one test match at the time of his second test match and we all know what happened next. Before I begin my ludicrously exciting episode with these remarkable peoples, let's take a quick commercial break. Did you know that Parsis in Mumbai, instead of being left at the Tower of Silence after they died, are now cremated? And why? Because a cow fell sick in the early 1990s? Did you know that the smog in Delhi is caused by something that farmers in Punjab do and that there's no way to stop them? Did you know that there wasn't one gas tragedy in Bhopal but three? One of them was seen but two were unseen? Did you know that many well-intentioned government policies hurt the people they're supposed to help? Why was demonetization a bad idea? How should GST have been implemented? Why are all our politicians so corrupt when not all of them are bad people? I'm Amit Verma and in my weekly podcast, The Seen and the Unseen, I take a shot at answering all these questions and many more. I aim to go beyond the scene and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private action. I speak to experts in economics, political philosophy, cognitive neuroscience and constitutional law so that the insights can blow not only my mind but also yours. The Seen and the Unseen releases every Monday. So do check out the archives and follow the show at seenunseen.in. You can also subscribe to The Seen and the Unseen on whatever podcast app you happen to prefer. Shruti, Vivek, Rajeshwari, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen."

        "message": "This is no surprise. I think the biggest thing going on is the jobs crisis. It's very strongly linked to the economic downturn. And it's going to become more acute because of the slowdown that the economy is experiencing. So I think the very first thing that we need to do is address the fact that we have too many people entering the job market and not enough jobs to go around. And this seems to be true pretty much at every level. So just in broad terms, the country is incredibly young, right? 50% of the country is below 25 or thereabouts. And all these people are young, fresh out of school or college or whatever their skill level is, they're all looking for jobs. The numbers were about 12 to 13 million people looking for jobs, plus another 6 million odd attempting to leave agriculture. And you know, so it was estimated about 20 million jobs a year. Now, because we failed to create 20 million jobs in the last five or six years, there's a further backlog, right? Because just because they didn't get a job the first year, they might be underemployed or sort of looking for employment. But those people are also sort of looking for a job. So the numbers, we don't have clear numbers on how many people are looking for a job each year, but it's about 20 million plus is a conservative estimate entering the workforce every year. And we are creating nowhere close to those number of jobs, right? And a big part of this is because the regulatory system doesn't allow easy hiring and easy firing. So the easier it is to fire someone, the easier it is to hire someone, right? So that's the biggest problem caused by the Indian sort of wage regulatory structure. Added to this is other things like you have inspection systems. So they really clamp down on industries, mostly manufacturing, where if you don't follow the labor laws, there's a host of labor inspectors who are just sort of, you know, capturing the rents coming out of this regulatory system. So they're incredibly corrupt. They make it very difficult for small firms to function. In response, the government decided to pass quite recently, maybe a couple of weeks ago, the wage code for 2019. All that the code does, to my knowledge, is compiles four previous acts, the Payment of Wages Act, the Minimum Wages Act, the Payment of Bonus Act, and Equal Renumeration Act, right? So they've just sort of done what they do best. They've given it a new name. They haven't made any real reform in making it cheaper. They've actually made it harder. They've brought in about 500 million people in India under the ambit of the code bill. And it comes with a penalty, including domestic work. And there's a penalty for not paying minimum wage, which is well above market wage. Like the minimum wage seems to have no relevance in reality to what's actually going on in the market. And there is a huge penalty, both fines and criminal penalty, for not paying minimum wage. And there is no enforcement mechanism. I don't know if that's good or bad. That's probably good. Because that way more people can be hired. But it also because of pernicious enforcement and arbitrary enforcement, you know, it would be harder for manufacturing units hoping to hire more people below minimum wage or something to actually go and do it. So this is the mess we're in. So what this probably requires is sort of scrapping the existing labor laws, and just really simplifying it, right? And the next is getting rid of the labor inspection system. Whatever is a problem should be solved contractually, like any other contract, right? This labor inspection system, which is sort of like the government holding a danda above every employer's head, that is really what's causing the jobs crisis problem. So this, I mean, we can talk about this a little bit more, it's very hard to do this reform, because of the unions. And there is obviously winners and losers in every reform, the unions will lose and a very vast number of people in the informal economy and those who are unemployed will gain. But the unions are well organized. And the people in the economy who are unemployed and those who in the informal economy are not organized. And that makes it very difficult to break this stronghold."

But one question that I had is, and this is just because I'm not very well aware of this particular field, which is that, even I hear that even in the formal sector today, there's a lot of contractualization of labor that's going on. And that actually took me by surprise, because I was thinking that contractualization happens more in the informal sector. But I keep hearing for the last five years, this has taken up massively in the formal sector. And I'm guessing this is obviously not optimal, because you're essentially working around the laws. And this also breeds insecurity, because these workers are not getting pension payments and other kinds of benefits. So would you have any thoughts on this? And if I may also add, and this is a broader point is, I don't completely think that the jobs crisis is because of labor laws, because our labor laws have been rigid and have been complicated and have been many and scattered for a very long period of time. And the jobs crisis, essentially speaking, has been brewing over the last few years. And it has actually broken out of the thing and everybody's talking about it over the last few years. And that perhaps also has a lot to do, and as you rightly mentioned, with the economic slowdown, which is basically, there's a manufacturing sector crisis that has been also brewing for a long time, there is a credit market crisis that's happening for quite some time. And as a result, there is a demand slowdown that's happening, which is perhaps leading to a situation where, because companies are not investing, they don't feel the need to hire more workers. And because they are not hiring more workers, they're not producing enough output. And that is having a vicious cycle effect. And a related point being that not enough workers have the skills required. So there is a skilling gap and there is a so I'm guessing what I'm trying to say is there are many other factors which have probably aggravated the current jobs crisis. And of course, it is perhaps built on the"

        "message": "base of a rigid labor law. So I think I would just add one more thing. I mean, I agree with you, we've always had bad labor laws. But what has made the effect worse and caused the glut is the demography, right? So and that is just something, it happened by chance, right? You don't control, you can control the regulatory system, it's much harder to control how the demographic dividend moves, right? And countries that have tried to control it, like China are in a total mess because of it. So one part of the glut is, we've always had terrible laws, but we never had so many people who were young and entering the workforce. So this is a bad combination of both. It's definitely, you know, we've had a jobs crisis for the last seven years. The economic slowdown is only maybe post demonetization, or maybe even last 18 months, you know, not immediately post demonetization, but I wouldn't agree, but we can debate that later. Yeah. So the last, you know, 12 to 18 months, you could start hearing warning bells and people started saying, you know, things are not good, something's going on. And you know, you start getting the different warning bells from different sectors, saying, okay, the GDP numbers don't quite add up to what's going on with cement, right? Today, the news last week is, it doesn't quite add up with what's going on with auto sales, right, or biscuit sales. So different sectors have sort of sent the SOS signal at different points. But we've had a demand slowdown for a while, right? And the demand slowdown definitely has an effect, you know, when people don't, and it's not just the slowdown, it's the expectation, right? When people form an expectation that demand is going to slow down further, they're even more nervous to hire employees. And that's a very large part of this contractualization that you're talking about, right? So one part of switching from long term labor contracts to this kind of, so you know, there are three versions of it. One is the very elite version, that is the Amit and Vivek version, right? They want to work for themselves, they would rather work on certain terms with different firms rather than have a single employer, and sort of clock in. So that's a very first world sort of and that those numbers are very small. The second group is where firms are trying to reduce the cost of labor, highly skilled labor to avoid paying pensions and provident funds and all the other employee benefits, right? So that you can see when there is economic distress, that's probably the first part that gets cut, because you don't want to lose the skilled labor, which is already scarce in India. And at the same time, there is some cost cutting that goes on. And then the third part is this kind of contractualization caused by uncertainty. We don't know if things are going to get worse, right? We just laid off six people, we don't know if we need to lay off 10 more people. So let's just sort of, you know, rework because it is hard, you know, we think of firing workers as sort of stroke of a pen thing, right? But when you're inside working within a firm, these are real people. It's difficult to fire and burn bridges, and then it's hard to hire them back when things are going well. So these sorts of arrangements are a product of we really want to hold on to skilled labor, and yet, we want to deal with the uncertainty. So I think broadly, you're right, it's not just a labor law issue. But that really, you know, that's the scaffolding that stifles everything else, you know, nothing can expand past that."

So you look at a company like Maruti, and I mean, from what I remember, half of their workers are contract workers, and half of the workers are employees. So on the same, you know, floor, assembly floor, you might have a situation where there are two people doing exactly the same thing. But one guy because he's employed, might end up making probably twice or, you know, two and a half times the guy who's on contract. So that's, and if you remember, there was a lot of violence in the Gurgaon belt, a few years back in an HR manager was burnt by the Maruti by not not at Maruti, this was at one of these auto ancillaries. So that's one point. The second point about, you know, I find this term demographic dividend very, very funny. A dividend, I know, we are assuming that there is a dividend already, it may not be a dividend, it might be a disaster as well, which is what it is turning out to be. The third point is, I mean, demographic dividend at a very simple level is that our parents basically produced way too many kids, right? On 15th August, I think the Prime Minister when he made his Independence Day speech talked about population and the need to control it. And you know, this is a huge misconception that people have, that India's population continues to grow, which is not really true."

So you know, what happens is when you and I, I mean, you know, given that we are so active on the social media, one of the things that sort of gets thrown off thrown at us all the time is, you know, problem, problem, solution. Now, the first thing is, you know, how do you come up with a solution without identifying the problem? I mean, that's as basic as it gets. But having said that, you know, this entire Indian tendency to sort of, you know, solution, but I think comes from the fact that when we, you know, write our exams, when we grow up, a lot of the, in fact, most of the questions have a right answer or a wrong answer. Okay. And that's primarily because of our focus on science and maths and so on. And we look down upon subjects like history and geography where. So, you know, so because of that, what happens is, this solution thing is very, very strong, and which is what we're doing here today. Now, one of the things that I realized while writing my, you know, book, last book, India's Big Government was that over the years, the government of India has constituted lots of committees on lots of issues. And all those committees have come up with recommendations and solutions. Or another, you know, that you have so many economists and experts working for the government. They also write regularly in publications, I mean, which the government sort of brings out. Now, what has happened is that, you know, if you to give you a very, very simple example, now look at the banking crisis currently, if you were to sort of go back to 1991, there was a Narasimhan committee, the first Narasimhan committee, as they call it, I mean, all the solutions are there in that report. And if you look at, you know, various social and economic problems that we've had, and, and the committees that were constituted to tackle them, those reports have all those solutions already. Okay, so it's not like the government does not know what is to be done. All they need to do is if you have a problem, just pick out the last report and go ahead and implement it. But obviously, you know, these solutions have not been implemented. I mean, even when a committee's solutions, recommendations are taken on, they're diluted to a large extent, and then they are pushed through. So the long and the short of it is that the government knows what is to be done. And this is not just the current government, or the central government, I mean, includes the state governments, the governments at the municipal level, but they don't do it."

So, so, virtue signalling is like, I mean, So, look at the current situation, you know, you talk to a corporate, you talk to an economist, and everyone's like, interest rates should be cut, interest rates should be cut. I mean, what will happen, you know, if the home loan is not at, you know, let's say, 8%, and it's at seven and a half? I mean, how will that help in any way? So, this is like, you know, you're just looking at the symptom that people are probably not borrowing. So, just cut interest rates. But you are not looking at why is it that people are not borrowing. So, anyway, so that was the long disclaimer, ki kuch hona nahi hai, but still, since we are here, we need to do our jobs properly. So, the first thing I sort of wanted to talk about is, and this is something a little, it's not really an, you know, I wouldn't call it an economic reform, but it's more of a reform in education. Now, what has happened over the years, over the last 70 years is that even, you know, the government has essentially paid a lot of attention on higher education. But the long and the short of it is that our primary education system is basically pretty much screwed up. And it's been screwed up even more after the right to education was put in place, which we have discussed in an episode. We have, yeah. So, one of the key clauses in right to education, I mean, if you read the Bear Act, is that the teacher has to complete the syllabus. Okay. Now, because of this, what happens is that, you know, students who come to school at a young age and come from a very reading deficient background tend to lose out because the teacher is essentially interested in completing the syllabus. And because of that, he ends up, he or she ends up concentrating only on the best students in the class who are picking up stuff. That's the first part of the problem. The second part of the problem is that there are no exams till class eight. So, irrespective of whether you are learning or not, you keep getting promoted and you reach class eight. Now, what has happened is in 2018 and 2019, you know, the first batch of RTE students who started in, you know, lower KG or preparatory or whatever you call it, in 2010, have now reached a stage where they have to write exams and they have never written exams in their life. So, this is the new crisis which is brewing and the parents don't know, even those who sort of, you know, belong to the well-off categories as to what to do with this. I mean, if a student has never written exams. So, my thing is that this is a problem that needs to be tackled seriously. And it's not about throwing more money at, you know, as a lot of people keep saying, and that includes me, that the government doesn't spend enough money on education. But you have to look at the situation a little more creatively. So, one solution, because, you know, which is what we all love, is something that, you know, Abhijit Banerjee, who's a famous economist at MIT, he shared with me many years back, and he talked about how they had carried out a small experiment in Bihar, in schools in Bihar, where they had hired teachers who were given contract teachers who were trained for two weeks. And then these guys went and taught in all these schools. And they had a very clear motive, as in, they didn't have to complete the syllabus, what they had to do is they had to ensure that if a student couldn't read, he had to be taught to read. If he couldn't write, he had to be taught to write. And if he couldn't do basic maths, plus minus, he had to be taught that. And when they sort of went back and, you know, you do a study, and you have a control group, and you know, you do all that. And when they sort of measured it, they found that the method, at least in the experiment, really helped. So you have to look at the entire problem from a very, very lateral point of view."

You know, so clearly these people, so Alex Tabarrok, and I have written some work on what Lantridge calls isomorphic mimicry, right? So this is basically you go to Denmark or something, you know, you go to the United States, you look around and you're like, what does a good school look like? Oh, a good school has large, airy classrooms, chalo, large, airy classrooms, right? So a good school has such and such teacher to pupil ratio, right? A good school has bathroom facilities, a good school has a separate kitchen area, a good school has a playground, which is at least 40 meters by 20 meters. So they make a note of all this, right? So when the government asked them, and this is where I disagree a little bit with Vivek, I think there is some knowledge crisis also in the government. They, the things they know are not the right things to know, right? So they're like, we know what a good school looks like. This is what a good school looks like. And if you fundamentally think education should be mandated top down, then it's easier to mandate inputs than outcomes, right? Because outcomes mean you'll have to be tested. And then so it is not a coincidence that these kids are not tested until eighth standard, right? We like to think they just kind of forgot and said no child left behind. No child left behind is also an American and foreign import. There are exams there. It's not like there are no exams. There are exams. So the fact that there are, it's completely devoid of any outcomes, you know, you see that schedule, there's not one single outcome, right? Now, all these economists, including some of these, you know, very fine, eminent MIT economists, and so on."

But one of the things that has come out of the, of the halls of MIT is this randomized control trial business, right? So these people now come and measure and what is measurable is inputs, right? So as Vivek pointed out, one of the things is the teacher needs to complete the syllabus. Another thing is that the teacher is a union employee, right? They get paid a lot of money, whether they show up or not. So what all these people found was all these schools are there, they have the correct size window, they have a bathroom, they have a kitchen, they have a playground, but the teachers don't show up. So all there are like RCTs, one after the other, which are trying to figure out how to reduce teacher absenteeism, right? And we've kind of forgotten the point. The point of the schooling was not that the teacher shows up, it was that the students learn. We assume that the teacher showing up is instrumental to the student learning, right? But that was not our end goal. So these people have really confused what the end goal is. They think end goal is delivery of inputs by the state. The end goal is actually that students need to know how to write their name by the time they're in second standard, and they need to know how to do arithmetic by fifth standard, and they need to be able to take an exam. So I think there is much more wrong with the RT and Vivek was actually being very, very generous and kind to the education bureaucrats."

First of all, I really like the point about isomorphic mimicry because I think that applies not just in education, but in many other areas of so-called public sector reforms that we just see somewhere, something very nice and shiny. And we think if we transplant that to India, it will work like a miracle. And we do exactly that. And we don't really, that's a hollow structure and we don't do anything inside. And I think this input and outcome thing that Shruti mentioned, I would just put a little bit more structure to it. So the way I look at it, it is basically input, output, outcome. So there are some inputs that you're putting in to reform any particular sector of the economy or the state, then you need to measure what is the output. Let's say in this particular example, how many students are graduating in a particular class, or how many boys versus girls. So these are the tangible outputs that you can measure. And it is very important for any reform to have this tangible output measure, not just looking at the input. And the final thing, which is very important is the outcome, that not only are you graduating a certain number of boys and girls, but what is it they're really learning. The learning is the outcome and the output is the students going from one class to the other or leaving the school or more students coming in. And the input would be the infrastructure, the teachers. Unless we design all our reforms in this kind of a structure, we'll just keep doing that isomorphic mimicry and we'll keep building the inputs, but then there'll be absolutely no evaluation of the output and the outcome, which is I think what ends up happening. And I have one more point to what Vivek's disclaimer was. I think it's absolutely fine to have committees and committee reports. And that's the way a lot of governments function. And I think the problem that happens in the implementation of the committee recommendations is a vast black box called political economy. I mean, economists will recommend whatever we want to recommend. And like in the banking example that you gave, right? I mean, when 70% of the banking sector is owned by the government, and the banks are regulated, it's not true"

So my reform basically is that we allow schools for profit. Now I want to set a little bit of context here. What really happened in the 50s and 60s was that we had a mindset that private enterprise was bad. Jawaharlal Nehru famously said to JRD Tata, do not speak to me of profit. Profit is a dirty word, stop quote. And as a result of that, there was a sense that there are some sectors of the economy which are too important to leave to the private sector. The government has to do them. And one of them, of course, was education. And there were a lot of sectors which were part of this. And what really happened with liberalization is that some of the sectors in which the government was controlling and there wasn't much private participation, were basically opened up. For example, if you remember, back in the 80s, you know, you could only fly Air India or Indian Airlines, they were prohibitively expensive. If you wanted a telephone, you had a five year waiting list, all of that, telecom got opened up, airlines got opened up. And instantly, you know, we can see the difference all around us. Today, a phone is accessible to anyone. And far more people can afford to fly than was the case earlier. The problem with education is that we haven't allowed schools for profit. And what that does with not necessarily debarring them, but with a host of regulations like your playground has to be this size and blah, blah, blah, and it just becomes almost impossible to run a school for profit. And a lot of private schools that exist do jugars with trusts and all of that. And the result of that is that the amount of choice that is available for parents goes down massively. And what you see across the country is people have this impression that private schools are just very expensive. And they're only for the elites. That's not at all true. What you see across the country is you have budget private schools opening up in slums. James Tully has written a book on this, I forget the name, and there have been studies by the Center for Civil Society. And we know from Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, that you have situations where schools open up impromptu in the slums, and like, poor parents like domestic help and auto rickshaw drivers and so on, prefer to pay 100 bucks or 200 bucks a month to send their kid to that school rather than to a free government school. Now, they're basically voting with their feet, which is as it should be, and which is how people choose bread, for example, by voting with their wallets. And I am often mischaracterized for saying that the government should get out of education, what will happen there, which is not my case at all. My case is simply that the government should do the same thing in education, which it did in airlines and telecom, you allow private players to participate without any conditions. Nobody wants to open a budget private school in a slum in a room only with no playground, allow them to do so, don't harass them, let the market vote with their feet, see what happens and get rid of this mentality that profit is a dirty word because the only way anyone can profit is by fulfilling somebody else's need. That is the only way to profit. Profit is therefore the greatest form of philanthropy. And I think this is like a fundamental mind shift that needs to happen, especially in education, where to add a point and to connect it to the jobs crisis. There is a massive mismatch today between the kind of workers coming out into the field and the kind of skills that are needed. People do PhDs and MPhils and they simply have no employable skills. And where does such a demand supply mismatch happen, where there is no market at play? Allow the freaking market."

Right. And one very large part of not allowing for-profit schools is the optics will be terrible because right now they can show the nice building with the airy windows and no teachers and no students and then compare it to these terribly crowded, you know, they actually look quite bad. Right. I went to maths tuition in 10th standard or 11th standard in one of these rooms where it was like a capacity for 30 people and 90 people were stacked. But the quality of the maths being taught to us was fantastic. It doesn't look good. So they produce these documents in court and say, look at these people commercializing. These children don't have room to breathe. There is no window in the room. They don't get bathroom breaks. Right. So if you really genuinely allowed for-profit schools, those schools would be able to invest. See, right now, the schools are under tremendous uncertainty.

        "message": "Thank you so much. So actually, yeah, I will not talk about jobs and education, but I'll talk about something that is related to government spending. So taking the cues from what Amit said about, you know, government should let the private sector come in and all of that. So my reform is basically about fiscal discipline, which I think is an extremely important thing for the government to follow. So whenever a government spends money, there are, let's say, three ways for the government to finance that expenditure. You can either tax the current generation, which is in a way the most fair way to do because the current generation is also benefiting from the goodies that the government is giving. Or you tax the future generation, which is unfair because the future generation is not benefiting from the government spending. The second way would be to borrow. And at some point, you will have to repay what you have borrowed. And the third is to basically print money and inflate your way out of it, which is a big burden on the poor. So either which way, whenever the government ends up spending, the burden falls on the taxpayer either today or tomorrow, one way or the other. And what the government typically ends up doing is, and this is not just the Indian government, this is governments in general have a temptation to spend 100 rupees today and tax only 90 rupees. This makes us feel very good because we are getting goodies worth of rupees 100, but we are only bearing the burden of 90. But what ends up happening is that 10 rupees gets pushed out to the next generation. So we make our children pay more for what we are enjoying today. And this is basically the classic way that what is called fiscal deficit, right, keeps on increasing and increasing. And that keeps on adding to the debt burden of the government. And that's a very serious problem. Because if governments give in to this temptation of spending and pushing the taxing in the future generation, then this can go on forever. And generation after generation keeps paying for this. And we have recently seen in Europe, for example, what happens when there is a sovereign debt crisis when governments default on their debt and so on so forth. Now coming to India, there is now given that we have Aadhaar and we have Jan Dhan accounts and whatnot, there is not only a temptation for the government to spend, but there is also a very easy way for the government to spend because all you have to do is essentially just keep giving your transfers and direct benefits or what have you made to these bank accounts. And what we have also seen is that the government has practically no interest to listen to whatever our Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management Act, a long thing, FRBM Act stipulated because that has become a farce and there is no real consequence for the government to violate it. And every year when the budget is presented, we spend a lot of time writing and discussing what is the actual fiscal deficit, what has been pushed out of the budget, so on so forth. So fiscal discipline, I think, is a big crisis in India and has been so for a while. So one reform that I can think of is, and it's a bit of a draconian thing, but I think that's what is needed, is something what Germany did. In the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, when the temptation of the government to give a fiscal stimulus was very high, and when Germany was in the acute shock of the financial crisis, the German debt to GDP had reached 80 percent and they were only supposed to be at 60 percent according to the Maastricht Treaty. So what the German constitution, what the German government did, which I think is remarkable, they were decent enough to say that at the time when the temptation of the government to run a high fiscal deficit is so big, we are going to tie the hands of the government. And so they enshrined in the German constitutional law something called a debt break, which stipulated that by 2016, the overall structural deficit of the government will be at a tight maximum of 0.35 percent of GDP. Now, imagine you're starting at a point where the debt to GDP ratio is 83 percent. And technically, you're saying that in the next four or five years, you bring down the structural deficit to 0.35 percent of GDP, which means your debt gradually goes down to 60 percent from 83 percent at a time when Germany is in the throes of the financial crisis. And all the states of Germany will bring down the deficit to zero by 2020. So this was a really, really tight fiscal discipline rule where Germany imposed a balanced budget on itself. And the consequence of that was that over the next seven years, from 2012 to now, Germany has run a budget surplus in each of the years. And last year, the German budget surplus was as high as 1.7 percent of GDP. And now the debt to GDP is actually at 60 percent, it's projected to be 50 percent. So it's a remarkable thing that they have done, and it's not that the German government is not spending. What they have done is you are essentially financing your expenses just from your revenue and you're shrinking your public debt, which is exactly what John Maynard Keynes would recommend, which is exactly what any fiscal sound principle would recommend, that you spend during bad times and you save during good times. And basically, if you save during good times, what it does is when the next bad time comes, you have the credibility and the space to borrow. Otherwise, if you keep borrowing and spending, you are just in that perpetual fiscal deficit mode where there is no credibility and nobody will want to lend you money if there is a war, if there is a deep recession. The only exception the German debt break constitutional amendment has is natural disasters and deep recession. Other than that, you have to stick to this rule. And I think that is something it's high time we introduce in India. And since constitutional amendment is not very difficult these days, we should enshrine that in the constitution and make a meaningful change to say we are going to tie down the hands of our government and that will force the government to prioritize its expenses. Instead of announcing 65 different schemes, which nobody is monitoring, you prioritize that, OK, if these are the five schemes which are important, I'm going to do this and then gradually shrink the size of the government. And as you said, let the private sector, let the market give them a chance and let them work. Otherwise, we'll end up in a situation where the government is so intrusive in our lives that it just keeps becoming a fatter and fatter cat. And who's financing it?"

And then they tend to do the right things. I mean, every other nation is not as lucky. The third point I wanted to make is and I mean, this is something, you know, we've had long conversations on is the fact that the fiscal deficit of the central government, you know, when we say is 3.4 or 3.3% of the GDP, I mean, that's one big sham. I mean, if you look at the total public sector borrowing requirement, as you know, the total borrowing of the government is termed as it comes to clearly, you know, it comes to 8.5%, 9% of the GDP in an era where our financial savings have come down dramatically. So I mean, one is that, you know, fiscal deficit is not represented correctly. And the other point, the more important point is that this is why interest rates are not going to come down. I mean, you can keep cutting the repo rate till kingdom come. But the banks ultimately have to compete with the government. So unless the government sort of cuts its expenditure, the interest rates are not going"

And one point to add to what Vivek said is, ironically enough, our government expenditure is ballooned at a time when apparently our economy has been booming, you know, it doesn't make any sense that if the GDP growth is showing that we are growing at 7.5, 8.2% in a quarter, that is the time when your government expenditure fiscal deficit is not able to stick to their FRBM target and you're going to 3.4, 3.5% of GDP. It doesn't make any economic sense whatsoever. Yeah, if you explain to me, fine, we are in a deep recession, you need to give some real good stimulus to infrastructure projects to yank the economy out of it. And you're going to cut expenses on the schemes. That's a different thing. But we are doing schemes, we are doing apparently some infrastructure, we are doing everything, because the government is doing all the spending, because all the other demand sources in the economy have gone to sleep. So we have no investment, no exports, no consumption, nobody's buying toothpaste or biscuits or cars. But the government is the big giant elephant in the room who's spending, because the government has access to some real secret source of money hidden away somewhere. Of course, that's not true, because we are all paying for that."

We had a very big economic stagnation, we had a slowdown. And that was also the time when the government had given a fiscal stimulus. But that stimulus was in the form of, let's say, an NHEI investment, a golden quadrilateral, like proper infrastructure investment. Now a fiscal stimulus takes the form of building toilets and houses and gases and I don't know what, right. So there is also a nature of fiscal stimulus that is needed. But I think, yeah, the overarching thing is whatever the government does, there needs to be a rule that ties down the hand of the government. And a rule that has real consequences, like if you're enshrined in the Constitution, it's a real consequence of the change that you really have to amend it again. And all off balance sheet fine, if you're a BHAL, if an FCI, if an NHEI, too bad, you also get clubbed into that because you have just been party to this whole thing as well."

And there are parts of the fiscal discipline, which is depending on the kind of spending can be better or worse, we've lost the plot there also. There's a great book on what you were talking about the whole, you know, taxing versus debt. So this whole nonsense of Ricardian equivalence, James Buchanan and Richard Wagner have a book called Democracy in Deficit, which talks about the inherent problems of democratic politics, which push it towards debt as opposed to taxation, basically, because when you're taxing people, they also tend to be your voters. And when you raise money through debt, those voters are either not yet voting or not yet born. So it is much easier to reduce taxes and increase debt, because those people are not yet voting, right. So we shift the problem to the next generation. And because any government is sort of, you know, has no limit in that sense, right, so it's going to be immortal. You can keep sort of rolling it on to the next generation and the next generation, the music only stops when you have these demographic problems or crises or something like that. So it's a lovely book that I recommend for everyone. Now, coming to Germany versus India, you know, Germany could have done this even without the constitutional constraint, because it's Germany. One, they have excellent legislative discipline, right, they have very good separation of powers. They have a very tight feedback mechanism between the voters and taxpayers, who are fairly rich individuals, like the tax base is really big, and the government, right. So all these three things included means that people do get upset in Germany, like regular folks get upset if you're going too much into debt, because they know what the consequences of that are. Now, that's not the case in India. So the temptation in India is let's constitutionalize it. Now I have studied all our 103 or whatever the number of constitutional amendments are. What we like to do is to push things to the constitutional stage, but it's ridiculously easy to amend our constitution, right, a little bit harder than passing law, passing legislation. It's really no constraint. We change the constitution. I keep buying new copies of the constitution in the last 15 years, because it keeps changing."

So now if you put this in to the constitution, like certain parts of the constitution, which are just, you know, there's one of these provisions of reservations, which Ambedkar had initially intended would eclipse after the first 10 years, you know, after 10 years, we won't need reservation. That was the world Ambedkar had imagined for India. Every 10 years, it's extended. It's a constitutional amendment. It is so procedural now, they just show up. You know what the quorum requirement, you know, how many people need to say yes, they just amend and move on. I have a feeling that any kind of fiscal responsibility in the constitution will just become one of those things, while they can still feel good about the fact that they constitutionalized it. So in some senses, it's, I think, even more dangerous. I think what is really important long run, right, I mean, since we're really looking for reform and not band-aid, long run, what is really important is, one, we need to really expand our tax base, right, our tax base is just not big enough. So our government both spends too much and too little, depending on which area of the economy that you're talking about. So and the larger the tax base, the more people will be upset if you increase taxes. So that also acts as some kind of fiscal check or fiscal constraints, because the moment you become a taxpayer, suddenly you start worrying about government spending and, you know, fiscal responsibility and so on. So that's, you know, one thing. The second goes back to our education problem, which is, you know, I mean, forget fiscal responsibility, we can't count in class 10. So the idea that we are going to have an electorate in 20 years from today, or even three years from today, who actually understand these things, you know, I mean, they don't need to understand it at the sophistication you have as an economics professor who does this for a living. But to just understand the basics of, oh, this is the arithmetic, right? And the government can't defy the rules of basic arithmetic the same way we can't. Right? So where does this gap coming from? That is just completely missing in these other people voting for them. So in some sense, I mean, what, what is your fail safe when the constitutional constraint fails? It's the people. Right? So maybe that fail safe is just missing, we've broken the constitutional fail safe."

So the first point about the fact that, yeah, of course, it's very easy politically to spend and of course, unpopular to tax, which is the case everywhere. But it's also and since we're talking of dream reforms here, right? It is imperative for the government to people also vote on the basis of what kind of public goods they have access to, whether they have a road next to their house through which they can go to the school, whether they have a school that they can they can learn to after the school, do they actually have a job, do they have the train connection. So people also vote on the basis of the public goods that they have access to, and not just on the basis of whether they are taxing more or less, right. And so if and given a fact in a situation where there are people who are accessing the public goods, and that's critical to them and not really the ones who are paying taxes, right. So if the government believes in this, that, okay, we have to basically win election on the basis of the public goods that we are providing, and not on the basis of this fiscal jugglery that we are doing, then it's not impossible. And it's not required that the all the people of the country don't need to understand that what the complicated fiscal math is. And this is something that is strongly believe in, we are not running the government in Twitter, we do not and should not continuously care about what all the people of the country want, you know, I mean, all the people of the country will want something that may not be good for the country, because they may not be aware of what is really good for the country. And that's perfectly fine. But if we tell them that we are giving you the services and the goods that you need, and we are not taxing you, that is a very, it's a nice dream world to have. And as I said, you don't literacy and education, of course, it is very important, but because we don't have it does not mean that we will reach a situation that as and when the population is literate, like Germany, only then we can aspire to have a debt GDP ratio, which is 60%. I don't think these two are should be connected. And, and the the last point I want to make is, yes, I agree that Indian Constitution is the most amended one in the world. And it is very easy to amend it. But my point is that what I the German debt break, I was using as an example, that something which is that tight something which is that enshrined in the law of the land, because clearly, there's some kind of a willingness because we did pass the FRBM Act. And we do keep mentioning FRBM every year. So there is some awareness, vague consciousness that okay, we need to be on the fiscal path. But there is nothing which is of consequence, because in any country, it is difficult to tie the hands of the government, because who will tie the hands of the government, the government itself. So it is very difficult, it is very tricky to tie the hands of the government, because the government itself will have to do it. Now, the reason I said constitutional amendment is because even if it is easy, but it's still relatively harder than just violating an FRBM Act without any consequence. But my point is to dream and think of some kind of a structure which will really tie the hands of the government so tight, that to violate it, there will be some consequence. Of course, you can argue that a government can do anything and there's no consequence, of course, with that caveat. Because otherwise, as you said, we will end up in a situation where the government will keep conning us for generation after generation. And we will never be able to move out of this state that the economy is in."

And so, you know, one of the core reasons is there is an administrative federalism, but there is no fiscal federalism. And what I mean by that is our taxes and spending are highly centralized, right? Now less and less so in the last 25 years or so, we have this fine establishment called the Finance Commission, where all our taxes, you know, think of it as sort of, you know, you collect all the taxes in one basket, and then the finance, it would go to the Finance Commission, not physically, but the idea of it, and they would make a split between how much the center gets and how much the state gets. And there are a whole number of ways to figure this out. One was, you know, union government was really under central planning. That's one part. The other part was, you know, depending on how poor the state is, or how much development it needs, or how much infrastructure needs to be built, get more money or less money. This is a giant rent-seeking exercise. There have been papers written on how, you know, this kind of fiscal control was used to punish opposition governments. So if you're the same party in the state forming government as the center, you could, you know, tend to get more money, then I think Stuti Khemani at the World Bank has written on this. And you know, if you're an opposition party forming a government in a state, they deny you the budget, and that's how they hold up. So one of the big, there are three reasons I want to see more fiscal federalism. The first is, we want more public goods. And what we mean by more public goods, most of the time, is we want the garbage outside our house to be picked up. We want better roads, we, you know, we all managed to get here on time. But I got here on time because I sort of accounted for 25-30 minute delay, which turned out to be true, because it's pouring in Bombay, and you know, every road is dug up, and it's a total mess. We would like to have better public infrastructure, right, we'd like airports to be better, trains to be better. We would like public schooling to be better, which is, you know, one function is the reforms we talked about, the other is expenditure. So we would like to see a lot of spending at the local municipal level. And our municipal governments have no money."

But overall, the centre devolves money to the states, and then the state has the option of devolving money. So you know, like, there's a central finance commission, every state has its own finance commission post the 73rd and 74th amendment. And depending on whether you're talking about the rural or the urban areas, the state is supposed to devolve finances to local government. That is not a condition. It's not mandatory. Right? It's a choice. So what ends up happening is, the states are spending a lot of money. And the union governments are spending a lot of money. But they're spending it on all useless things, as Rajeshwari pointed out, right? They're not spending it on the things we care about. So you can have government spending, which causes both stimulus, also builds infrastructure and also delivers public goods to the people who need it the most. But the money never goes there. The money goes to satisfy special interests with these freebies that are highly targeted to capture one vote bank or another, or you know, for uptakes like this whole toilet building thing with just you know, I mean, then I've talked about it just drives us crazy. So one huge, you know, this is one reform, which can sort of kill a lot of birds with one stone. One part of it is municipal governments will be more empowered. So I get this idea from all the condo associations that I see, you know, they collect this common charges of fees that you see in Bombay and Delhi, and actually spend that money, right? And when you go to these condo association meetings, people are really up in arms about an increased charge or you know, you took money to build a you know, water filtration plant and then never got built and there's all this. So there's a lot of local politics, which can be tied to fiscal feedback. And that's an opportunity we're missing right now. Right? So the municipal corporator, no one knows his name. That's one problem. So this will solve that problem. The second problem it will solve is, it will divide the functions of different levels of government much better. Right? So the union government is supposed to maintain law and order at the highest level, right? Interstate highways, interstate river water, right, foreign trade, of course, safety and security of the country, right? That's all that kind of expenditure, or you know, large externalities, like pollution across states. That's really the job of the union government. Everything within the state, which is your, you know, local highway, all your public parks, you know, which are going beyond municipal boundaries. That's the job of the state government and then, you know, lower level further municipal government. And we just don't have that clean demarcation. But the moment you make a demarcation with money, the demarcation and goods will be a little bit more, it won't be automatic, it won't happen overnight, but it will happen over a period of time. Right? And if you look at the state spending in a place like Maharashtra, disproportionate amount goes to rural and farmers freebies, right? Even though Maharashtra has been urbanizing at a very rapid pace, right? And that doesn't get reflected and the spending is at the state level. And Mumbai citizens are underrepresented in votes and overrepresented in revenue giving, but not in expenditure."

        "message": "mismatch between power and accountability. Exactly. So that's the second part, right? So first is we actually get public goods. The second solution is it actually demarcates what each level of government is supposed to do and can do. And the third part is tying the hands of government, which is what Rajeshwari was talking about. I think this is a bottom up way of tying the hands of government, right? You allot different fiscal resources and therefore different levels of fiscal accountability. I would like to live in a world where the maximum spending is done by the municipal government because that has the tightest feedback level, right, at that level. And also that's where we use the public resources the most. You want a public library, you want a public park, you want poor children in your area to have, you know, certain things despite their income level, which is, you know, access to schools and access to water and access to vaccination. So that's what I would like to see. So that's the second part. Now, the fiscal responsibility, because of the tight feedback, you automatically, you know, you first of all create a check between government. So there's a horizontal separation of powers, but there's also a vertical separation of powers, right? So this way, municipal government, state government and union government have to fight over the size of the pie and how they split it, which is a really good check for each other. And the second is, this is a bottom up way of really tying the hands of the union government, which is what is doing a bulk of the sharing of the spending. And that's why it is so mistargeted, right? So you absolutely right, you know, both Rajeshwari and Vivek have said, we've been in some kind of stimulus mode for the last two years. It's just it's not working like a stimulus, because it's all nonsense that we're spending on. So you can also stimulate the economy, you can, you have different livers to pull, you have more sophisticated livers to pull, though I don't believe in that kind of like hydraulic Keynesianism. But even if you were of that school, you have more sophisticated livers to pull when you can split fiscal levels."

So this is one kind of voting with your feet, which is made lower cost, because voting with your feet comes with a constraint, you have to uproot your whole life. So that's one part that makes the feedback mechanism tighter. The second part that makes the feedback mechanism tighter is your voters are your taxpayers. So there is much, you know, even though first of all, all of us are not voting for Modi ji, right, it's a representative system. The second is, all of us are not paying taxes, right? So there is this really big problem of everyone who voted for Modi ji and everyone who is paying taxes to Modi ji. And I say Modi ji because he's the one really, you know, in control, right?

So right now we are centripetal because we have three lists, but we have enough loopholes in the constitution that the center can usurp any of the three lists completely, right?

Since we are dreaming is how about now we all know that the cities of India are really struggling, right? There's a water crisis. There's an infrastructure crisis in Bombay, in Madras, in Calcutta, wherever, right? So how about converting the top 10 cities of India into states? And just hear me out a little bit on this. The model that I have in mind is like a New York or a London, which have their own directly elected mayors. And the mayors are like the CEOs of the New York government and the London City Council. And they're basically responsible for running the institution, the economic development, the infrastructure, everything in the cities. What is happening in our cities is, as Shruti pointed out, is, for example, in Bombay, right? Bombay is generating a lot of tax revenue, so to speak. But how much of that is something that's really coming to the Bombay for Bombay's own development? Now, I come from Calcutta, which was once called the Paris of India, East India, no longer the case. Calcutta is held hostage by a lot of politics of the hinterland. The chief minister of Calcutta or chief minister of Bengal has to bother a lot about what's happening in the rural state, because West Bengal is essentially a rural state. What's happening in the hinterland politics of the districts and villages. And much less attention gets actually paid to what the city needs. And as a result, the city is really struggling today in terms of jobs, infrastructure, institutions, everything. So instead of that, since we have a familiar machinery of the state, why not convert the top 10 cities into states so that they get the autonomy, they get autonomy of financing, they get autonomy of economic development of those regions. But then you can have real good development pockets, instead of saying that there are only two big cities in India, which is Bombay and Delhi."

I mean, you know, you have to have one, you know, capital gain is capital gain, and you tax it like that. I mean, in some cases you have indexation, in some cases you have no indexation. So the point is that you have to have a stable tax system. Now, look at something like GST, you know, every time the GST council meets, there is some change. So there are changes which are happening at the central level, there are changes which are happening at the state level, which is why, you know, if you look at the annual return for 2017-18 of GST, only 20% of people have filed it till date. So I think you need to have a stable tax system. And in case of GST, what has happened is, they've obviously launched it without thinking it through. So they have to keep changing it. Now, you know, you can't keep changing it every week or every, you know, every time the GST council meets. So better thing to do right now would be to sit down and figure out what is wrong, and then make major changes at a single go, instead of meeting every time and tweaking this and tweaking that and making, you know, things difficult for everyone. So like, if you if you sort of, you know, pick up the what is called as the HSN book, which is, you know, the codes for the economic activity you carry out, if you are in the goods part, and then there is something for the services part as well. Now, it's a huge thick thing. I mean, why?"

But then, you know, you'll have the argument on the fact that how can, you know, something that everyone is using and Mercedes be taxed at the same rate. But boss, Mercedes, if it comes to 1 crore, then 15% tax will come to 15 lakhs. This is something that, you know, people don't get, but then they don't want, they're not happy with 15 lakhs, they want 43 lakhs, because they want to tax it at 42% or 43% or whatever. So as long so, you know, this is something that will sort of also help, I mean, along with being a structural reform, it will also have an immediate impact on economic activity."

And it's one of those things that we all know needs to be done, but never really gets done. And we actually end up complicating more and more with this new GST fiasco. The other thing that I think is also very important to understand is if you want to avoid tax evasion, and if you want to expand the tax base, it's very important to keep the tax rates low. I think we just don't get that math at all, because our tax revenue is the multiplied product of tax base and tax rate. Now, if you want to increase the base, you have to lower the rate, otherwise, if you keep the tax system at a very high rate, the probability of tax evasion goes up that much more. And then in order to justify the high rate, you also give a lot of exemptions. And then the exemptions increase the leakages from the system even more. And then in the end, you're sitting with a really complicated system that you cannot monitor because you don't have enough employees in your tax administration. So it's a total mess at the end of the day. So two easy and finite things to do is one is ease tax administration by doing the logistical reforms of filing ease and all of that, and lower the taxes, be direct tax, indirect tax. Our corporate income tax is one of the highest in the world. It doesn't have to be so in a country when we want to encourage investment and make in India and all of that. So lower the tax rate and make the tax administration easy. You will expand the tax base. And with that expanded tax base, again, coming back to the point of anti-fiscal discipline, if you then have a tax base, which is expanded, then you remain within the means of the tax revenue and you spend. But all of these things are stuff that again, we have talked about, but for whatever reason and political economy, etc, there is a lot of inertia to do this."

Palaji's GST rate, I believe is 18% on biscuits, is that accurate? I mean, if Vivek doesn't know, but it's high, it's double digits and it's high. The GST on gold is 3%. And right and the GST on diamonds is 0.25. And if you go back and check the timing of reducing the GST on gold and diamond, it was done for some handicrafts, cottage industry reason.

So it's a compelling read where Tony Joseph uses recent pathbreaking DNA research to essentially trace the history of Indians and essentially the truth that comes out of the book to summarize in a sentence is who we are and where we have come from. And the truth is that we are all immigrants and we have all come from somewhere else. And of course, he talks about the waves of migration, so on and so forth. So now, the reason I started with that is basically to say that there is nothing called a pure Indian. There's nothing called an indigenous Indian, right? We are all from somewhere else. And in that spirit and in a world where there is so much of intolerance now and border closing obsessions and whatnot, I think that we should we should be a country again in the dream world where we open up our gates and borders and doors, whatever you have, to whoever wants to come and live in India. Now, if that doesn't agree with your moral fiber, for whatever reason, then the next layer I would say is open up the borders to those who are desperate and helpless, which would be the refugees. If that too doesn't agree with the moral fiber, for again, whatever reason, the third layer that I would settle down in my dream world is open up your gates to those who are skilled. For example, whoever has an undergraduate degree from a decent university in the world, give them immediately a work visa and let them work in India and after 10 years, naturalize them and give them Indian citizenship or encourage students from all over the world to come and study in Indian colleges and universities. And don't stop at giving them a college degree, offer them jobs, offer them citizenship. I think India should aspire to be a country where people want the Indian citizenship. And that should be the level that we should dream about instead of saying that we are going to be this very insular country where we care about indigenous Indians. And I think we are going exactly the regressive way because immigrants are great because immigrants, they bring knowledge, they bring capabilities, they integrate us with their countries. They help knowledge sharing. They are, research shows, they're low on crime because they are scared of getting deported. So they basically work hard to stand on their own feet. They don't have a political clout, so they don't ask for your welfare benefits. And there are countries which have been built by immigrants, as we all know. I mean, my favorite example is Steve Jobs, who was the child, illegitimate child of a Syrian father who was a refugee, so to speak, in the U.S. and a Catholic mother of Swiss German descent. And that would be impossible today because Syrian refugee would obviously be turned away. The other example, of course, is Barack Obama, who is the child of a Kenyan father and a mother of, and let me remember this correctly, English, Swiss, German, Scottish, Irish and Welsh ancestry. And they got married at a time when Barack Obama's father was a student in Hawaii on scholarship, a foreign student on scholarship. So and there are, of course, many, many such examples, right? So I think India, in my dream world, we should aspire to be that country where we are open to immigrants and we are naturalizing them into citizenship. We will not get the good brains of U.S. and Europe, perhaps, but we will get the good brains of South Asian countries, of Middle Eastern countries, of African countries. And I think that is great, and that's what we should dream about."

If you're only allowing skilled people, I think the numbers will be too minuscule to make a difference to a large demographic dividend, if anything. And if you're really worried about it, then the Indian state should think about or the private sector, the markets that you are not going to worsen the demographic dividend problem by letting people coming in who are probably more skilled. The whole idea is why should we be restricted to our local skill pool? We should be able to access the skill pool everywhere in the world. And starting with my initial premise, there is nothing called Indians to begin with. We should first have a change of mindset instead of having that kind of an insular mentality."

And that's perfectly fine for us because we actually benefit from it. So I'll give you a small number, which will show you how lopsided the thing is. The total number of foreign students who are studying in other countries in 2017 was 5 million. In India, there are only about 48-49,000 foreign students, which is less than 1% of the number.

        "message": "Let's move on now to reform number eight. And it's my turn again. And this is a pet reform. And it's actually a reform I feel really, really strongly about. And the reform very simply is abolish family planning. I think population control is one of the absolute worst ideas of modern India. And this is at two levels. It's at what I would say a consequential level and a deontological level. Let me explain both. One, there is this kind of zero sum thinking where, started, of course, famously by Malthus and now called Malthusian, where the sense is that there are only so many natural resources, we are going to run out of them if there are too many people. And therefore, we have to do population control. And what this completely ignores, and this has been proven completely false over the centuries, but the myth still persists. And what this completely ignores is that human beings are, in the words of the economist Julian Simon, the ultimate resource. And what typically happens is that the more the population density anywhere, the greater the prosperity that you're likely to see. You see this at the level of countries where you have countries like Bahrain and Monaco, which have far greater population density than say Bangladesh or India. You see this within any country, where the most prosperous parts of a country are those parts with the greatest population density, which is why cities are the richest parts of any country and the history of humankind is a history of urbanization. People move from less populated areas to more populated areas because you get the chance to be part of larger economic networks with all the benefits of specialization and division of labor that entails and also because people are, you know, to quote Simon again, the ultimate resource. So with our ingenuity, we get over any possible shortfall of natural resources that happens. And this also kind of plays to the point that Rajeshwari made about immigration, where people might well ask that why should you let people in on a work visa when, as we discussed earlier in this episode, there is such a massive jobs crisis. And my sense is no, the thing is that the more people there are, the better we will do. One of the problems that we currently have, which seems to be because of too many people are problems of bad governance. Many of the reforms that we've suggested play exactly to that bad governance, bad incentives, so on and so forth. If people were a problem, people would not be moving from rural areas to cities. And we would not be constantly logically, rationally urbanizing. In fact, if you're listening this and you live in a city, you've actually, you know, in a sense voted with your feet or by being where you are. My second more important point, and this makes me really angry, the moral point, the deontological point is that our bodies do not belong to the state. We are all individuals, the job of the state should be to protect our bodies, not to tell us how many children we may or may not have. I, of course, have chosen, we have chosen not to have any, but that's a different matter. That choice is something that should be made by all individuals. And to me, it is shock. And I'm not just, you know, I'm not just outraged by the kind of coercive family planning and the Nazbandis carried out by that monster Sanjay Gandhi during the emergency and his equally monstrous mother, the kind of policies they put in place. Family planning still exists in India today. The Ministry of Health still incentivizes local level workers to, you know, still today to carry out Nazbandis and to carry out sterilizations. And the state is giving incentives to coerce people or to, you know, for people often to themselves going and it's always, again, the women who are at the receiving end of this. Very rarely will you find that the man is actually going to a clinic and saying, chalo Nazbandi karwa do. It's the women with whom it's a problem. So these are the two problems I have, consequential and moral. I think Vivek raised this."

You know, economists would always tell you that resources are scarce, but resources are scarce. They're not fixed. Right. And the resources aren't fixed because of human ingenuity. Right. Now, look at a city like Bombay. You have a fixed piece of land in the sense that, you know, there's only so much land. It's a peninsula and there's water surrounding it. Right, because of human ingenuity on things like concrete, right, or elevators, elevators, according to me, are the best mass transit system, right? Because you can go up so many floors in a matter of seconds. And so that didn't come because that resource existed. Human beings had to make that resource, right?

Earlier, there was this idea that growth is a function of some lever you pull, right? Some exogenous shock will happen. You'll get this spurt of growth and that'll, you know, there'll be some spillover effect and that's it. But what you talked about cities, cities are endogenous growth engines, right? There is growth because of something inherent that is happening when a lot of people mingle with each other in a small physical space or a small intellectual space. So and as you pointed out, most of us choose to live in dense places because that's where the opportunities are. So this is, you know, part of the problem. The other part of the problem is we are very poor on service delivery. So the metaphor for the Indian citizen when it comes to life is standing in line, right? That is really the life of the common man. So when you're standing in line, you blame everyone who's standing in front of you. That's really the problem. So this mindset comes for the state from one place, it manifests in the citizen from a completely different place because we have just failed to provide the basic services that you need, right?

You know, we need a fixed prison system, we need to fix courts and things like that. But I think at the very least, even before we improve quality and do police reform, judicial reform, I think one way to stimulate the economy with all this government spending is just triple the police force. Just triple the number of courts, triple the number of judges, right? Triple our entire law enforcement structure. Now I'm going to get trolled heavily for this because anytime I suggest adding to government, someone calls me and asks me to throw my non-existent libertarian card in the Ganges, which is dirty."

So one is, no, but there are, you know, speaking of the unintended consequences, so what's ended up happening in India is we keep passing laws as a substitute for enforcement, right? So the number of rapes are on the rise, right? We don't know what to do about it. There is some moral and public outrage. So we pass a law that will, you know, change the juvenile rape to a normal rape law, or we will change, you know, regular penalty to death penalty and so on and so forth. But that's only one part, right? Now making it death penalty doesn't mean it's being enforced more. So the women are being raped as much or as little as they were before you pass this law, because no one, forget rape, you don't get called into question or even get a slap on the wrist for anything, groping, molesting, leering. Every woman I know has experienced someone, you know, flashing her and groping her and so on. And this is not just about women. It's about everyone, right? So when you have very poor law enforcement, one of the consequences of that is there is selective enforcement, right? And the police must decide what is the most important case at hand. Now when you can choose, you obviously, there is some politics involved in what are we choosing to enforce in society, right? So if you notice, it is always the disenfranchised who get harassed the most. So there used to be a section 377. It was never enforced, but it was used as, you know, the Matunga."

So the selective enforcement allows the government to use the police as a tool to punish any opponents. That's one very poor unintended consequence, or maybe an intended consequence of having weak law enforcement. That's what you see in India. And now with this whole nationalist movement on the rise, people keep complaining that you know, why are these people who are lynching going free and not getting, well, it's basically because our entire law enforcement system is completely broken. We have no chain of custody when it comes to evidence that requires people, it requires, it literally requires more hands on deck and manpower, right? Requires labs, it requires infrastructure. So one part of it is, of course, as a society, we're choosing to look the other way. But even if you have good people in a system that's broken, and is like just barely functioning, you're going to get consequences like Bailu Khan, right? So I think the big one we need to solve is law and order. And I think the first step towards solving that is just more hands on deck. I know some of the laws they will enforce are terrible, but we still just need more law enforcement. We need more constables, more traffic police, you know, just the, we really need to increase"

But I do think it helps to have more police on the streets or in the metro or at the train station to prevent basic things like right now, the system we've devolved into in India is no one's even reporting a mugging. The only time you report a theft is because you need an FIR to get a new driver's license, right? Or to, you know, give it to the credit card company to get out of fraud or something like that. So one of the consequences of just not having hands on deck is extreme underreporting. Because you have no one to report to and no one's willing to write the report. Or there's just no one present, right? Which means all your small offenses. And when I say small, I mean, minor in terms of both punishment and how society views them. They just go underreported. So it looks like society doesn't have these problems, but the deadweight loss is somewhere else. You know, people don't carry as much money as they would like to carry, right? People don't carry gold when they travel across cities to go to a wedding or something like that, because everyone's nervous, right? You don't go out late at night, you don't go to watch a movie, you don't take a job that's going to require late hours. You don't go to a university that's too far, right? So this is how it compounds. So will just having more police solve all problems? No. Will having more judges will go a much longer way in solving problems than more police. With police, there is also a fear that unless we fix the pernicious regulation, this could also manifest into an exercise where police has more control.

So if you look at the pending cases, so one point is that what kind of cases are pending, okay. And very, very interestingly, a lot of cases which are pending have to do with vehicle chalans. Okay. Now that is not something that needs to go on and on and on. So all it needs is essentially a dedicated court, and you put in a few young guys, it's not like a complicated reading of the law that is required there, put in some recruit a few more young judges, put them there. And then, you know, you can tackle this problem at a very fast pace, you can do it by post. Also, the second thing that is, you know, this is something that Shailesh Gandhi had written a very interesting column on in the Times of India a few years back. And what he said was that it's not like the courts are not doing any work, they're disposing close to 2 crore cases a year, which is like a huge number. But what is happening is that the number of cases that sort of new cases that come on are more than that. So essentially, you know, if you sort of let's say, you know, I mean, I remember this offhand, so I may not be very sure of the numbers. So like India has, I think, the number of judges that the high court judges, the number of positions is around 1040 or something like that. And the last time I checked, we had some 600 or something like that who were appointed to those posts. So the point is, even if we don't create extra posts, and we just appoint the number of, you know, the posts that are already there, that in itself will take care of a large part of the problem. And one frivolous point, basically, the police thing, you know, when you want to, the fact that more police may not solve the problem. So there's this movie called China Gate many, many years back, which had, you know, the villain was played by this guy called Mukesh Tiwari, it was his first movie. And there's a line in the movie which said that ki hum se ladne ki taqat toh le aoge, par hamara kameena pan kahan se laoge."

I mean, like, you know, even before I came here, I was reading, you know, the news, in the newspaper today, there was this news about how Air India has asked, you know, the government again for money, you know, some 2,000 odd crores. Now, I mean, it's not, I mean, why should a government be running an airline? I mean, nowhere in the world does, at least not in the developed world, maybe in the developing world, they still do. So the government should not be running an airline. The government should not be making condoms. The government should not be making seven-seaters. The government should be, I mean, as far as banking is concerned, I think that, you know, if they want to be in banking, they should probably run five, six big banks, and then just sell off the, or just shut it down. I mean, you know, if a bank like Indian Overseas Bank shuts down, nothing is going to happen to the state of the Indian economy. I mean, or if you look at a bank like Bank of Maharashtra, I mean, it could possibly concentrate on the state of Maharashtra, where it has, you know, extensive presence. There's no point of, you know, Bank of Maharashtra opening a branch in Assam. It just doesn't make any sense. Or look at the Jammu and Kashmir Bank. By far the best example, Jammu and Kashmir Bank is not a, it's not a nationalized bank. It has branches in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, has access to, you know, a lot of deposits, and then, you know, it lends that money. So you need that kind of model, like Dena Bank, once upon a time, used to be pretty good at trade finance. So it could have specialized and continued to be in that space instead of being, you know, merged away with Bank of Baroda, so as to hide its bad loans rate, very, very high bad loans rate of 22%. So all this merger-sharjah is basically, again, you know, it's essentially trying to hide the bad loans of the bad banks, and it's not going to help in any way. Like when is State Bank of India, I mean, by far the best example, before the merger with its five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, had a bad loans rate of something around 7.2% or something. And after the merger, the rate increased to 10%, because all these banks came up with their bad loans. So State Bank essentially cleaned up its book, and then had to start cleaning it all over"

The government will basically want to go all out and grab all the power in that field and say, okay, we are basically the Mahibab in this field. So I think in that sense, it's a little bit of a black and white that if you really want to shrink the size of the government, the government should be restricted to the five or four basic functions of, of defense and law and order and etc, etc, and not be in at all in banking, in hotels, opening tiffin canteens in Tamil Nadu, or whatever it is they're doing nothing at all just define four basic functions that the government should do. And that also addresses all the other our previous points about fiscal responsibility and doing education opening up to the private sector and all of this.

Politicians need campaign finance, right? Campaign finance is given to them by these builders and all these industrialists, and so on so forth.

So Devi Lal was asked and the camera angle was he's basically lying in a dhoti and a banyan on this charpai kind of thing. And the camera angle is from his, he's wearing keds. So it's his keds. So massive keds, small Devi Lal face in the background. And the question is, so Devi Lal ji, aapne apne bete ko CM kyu banaya? And Devi Lal said, toh kya Bhajan Lal ke chhore ko banao?

        "message": "Kindly continue. Okay. So my next and last reform is actually very, very narrow in scope and very specific. But in a way it is tied to my first point about fiscal discipline. And this is about, this is related to banking. So I'm moving to the financial sector. So now in India, what happens is banks and other financial institutions like insurance funds and pension funds have to hold large amounts of government securities through what we call statutory liquidity ratio. That's the technical term. And essentially this boils down to financial repression, because this is the captive market that the government has access to. And the government bonds are basically something that have to be bought by the banks and the insurance companies. And through that, the government keeps on maintaining a fiscal deficit and whatever it is. It makes it much easier. And the sort of the lie that the policymakers also tell us, including the Reserve Bank of India, is that this is not financial repression. This is prudential regulation. This is required for the safety of the banks. And the banks need to hold on to safe assets, because that's just how the prudential regulation works. Now, what my reform is about is, I want to bust that myth, because this is not a safety asset, because the Indian government bonds are not the safe assets. Because if you look at Indian government credit rating internationally, it is borderline investment grade and one step away from speculative grade. So if we really want our banks to be safe and our financial institutions to be safe, it is policy adventurism to tell them to hold government securities, Indian government securities. And instead, if you really want them to hold liquid assets, they should be holding minimum double A rated or more triple A rated assets of foreign governments, like international assets, which have much higher rating, much higher credit rating and are actually safe and liquid, because Indian government securities are not even liquid. And there are also the additional risk that every time the interest rate goes up, the banks are actually incurring losses. So it cuts them multiple ways. So instead of that, you reduce, and of course, if you are tying the hands of the government in the fiscal discipline, which was my first point, you don't need to do this financial repression of SLR, you cut down the SLR significantly, and for the safety purpose, the bank should actually be holding foreign government assets, which are triple A rated. And the reason I thought about this is also in the last 10 years, what has been happening in Europe has been an eye opener, because of the sovereign debt crisis, the banking sector in European countries has been really struggling, because the banks of Italy and Greece were actually holding their own domestic government bonds. And when the governments defaulted, when the governments went on the brink of a default, these banks basically took a massive hit. And this in economics is what we call home buyers. And home buyers can really be very costly, because you are not diversifying your portfolio, you're putting all your eggs in one basket. And in India, as I said, it goes one step further, because it's financial repression, because to that extent, banks are also not able to lend to the rest of the economy. So you kill many birds with this one stone, if you say that, okay, banks will hold liquid assets of foreign governments, which are triple A rated, and you reduce that SLR so that banks have that much more money to lend out to the rest of the economy. And you also take away that captive bond market from the government, which the government very nicely and comfortably falls back on. So that would be my third and last reform."

And so the first thing here is that, you know, it's not like the RBI hasn't done anything about it. The SLR has been reduced from, you know, from what I remember from almost 38% to now it's at 18.75. But the bank's investment in government securities has not come down in a similar way. So if you I mean, the last that I checked, a couple of months back, almost 27-28% of the total liabilities that the banks have, were invested in government bonds, even though you know, the number should have been around 19, 19 and a half percent. So banks also like to do some lazy banking, wherein, you know, you just put in some money there and our arms interest are high. So that's, that's one point. The second point is, you know, as far as the government is concerned, I mean, it obviously is a very, very easy way for it to raise money. And given that it is compulsory for banks to buy these bonds, the yield that the government ends up paying on these bonds is extremely low, because, you know, if you start to factor in, you know, typically how, you know, thumb rule to price a bond is, you know, you take inflation and you take some risk premium, and you add it and you come at a basic rate. So if you do that, I mean, then the bond yields would not be as low as they are, okay. So obviously, you know, the bond yields would go up, interest rates would go up. So there is a flip side to it as well. But what will happen over a period of time is that because there is, you know, the access to this easy money goes away, the chances of the government being more fiscally prudent and fiscally disciplined will go up as well."

Because it's now we really have to open our mindset to the thing that financial markets have to be really liberalized, not liberalized in the sense that Indians mean it. But basically have your currency hedging options and banks will hedge the currency risk, give them the option of diversifying their portfolio into multiple assets, instead of taking them into this colonial kind of a past where you only hold government securities."

Reform 3A, do away with rent control. Reform 3B, reform FSI. Now, to just quickly explain both of these, rent control, on which I had an episode with Shruti's co-writer and good friend Alex Tabarrok, is this ludicrous law, which has crippled a lot of Mumbai, which is basically that at one point, government decided that rents are getting too high, let us fix the rents. So rents were fixed, which is why you go through Marine Drive and parts of South Bombay, you'll find people are paying 300 rupees a month, 200 rupees a month for these large lavish houses. Now, what does this do? What this does is that it reduces the incentives for the owners to look after their house. In one sense, it's not their house anymore. Their property has essentially been taken away from them. The same way governments, for example, to go back to my old rant, take away our bodies with something like family planning, assert their right over it. And what this has meant is that, number one, that there are large stretches of cities, you know, South Bombay just comes to mind very easily, where you have old dilapidated buildings where no one has the incentive to look after them. Number two, this reduces the housing supply. And what it means is that because the housing supply is so restricted, and not what it should be, that the rents and real estate prices are far more than they otherwise would be simple supply and demand. The second one is increasing FSI, FSI stands for floor space index, but what it basically means is that there is a limit to how tall you can build your building. Now, Bombay has an FSI of about one as far as I recall. And there are countries in the world which have like, I think New York has 15, parts of Hong Kong have 25-30. And again, I did an episode on this with Alex Tabarrok. And Alex coined a beautiful phrase, which was in fact the title of that episode, which is reclaim the sky. He said that what we have done in Mumbai is we have tried to reclaim the sea and there is a limit to that. But we can reclaim the sky and there is no limit to that. His argument is that FSI should be far, far more, let people build upwards. And the typical objections which are made against increasing FSI is that our infrastructure is already crumbling, public services already crumbling, they won't keep pace. But the same objection has been used before FSI has been raised in other cities across the world at different stages of development. And what inevitably happens is that supply catches up with demand, and the infrastructure and public services do well enough. What this will really do is if you increase FSI, is because people will be building upwards and building more, land prices will come down, rentals will come down, more people will be able to move into the city at a lesser cost. Again, all the benefits of population density, larger economic networks, and, you know, to an extent less slums, and it's just, you know, it's a no brainer why we don't do it."

Elevators are a mass transit system when you reclaim the skies, and they reduce congestion on the roads. And they are environmentally friendly, because you can carpool, if elevators are actually a substitute for a car. And they are substitutes for metro and so many more things.
