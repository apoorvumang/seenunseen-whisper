My friend and frequent guest on the show, the economist Shruti Rajagopalan, who specializes in constitutional economics, wrote an angry article about it in The Wire, which is linked from the show notes. I invited her back on the show to chat about this case in particular and the Supreme Court in general. But before we get to that conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

        "message": "So there were a few things going on in this particular case that really distressed me. So as we all know, there was a sexual harassment complaint by one of the staff members of the Supreme Court of India who worked for the current Chief Justice, Justice Ranjan Gogoi. And she sent an affidavit to the other 22 justices of the Supreme Court and requested an inquiry into her complaint that she had been subject to sexual harassment and abuse. Now it just so happens that the Supreme Court of India was the front runner when it came to sexual harassment. This is in a judgment called Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, which was far back, like in 1997 and well before there was any MeToo movement or even any serious recognition of the problem of sexual harassment at the workplace by any other institution in the country, the Supreme Court said, we need to recognize this problem. There is a huge gap in the law. In a very activist opinion, they actually did what we call now legislating from the bench. That is in the absence of law, they literally made law. So the Supreme Court provided a series of guidelines on what needs to be done by every single workplace in India to prevent sexual harassment and how to deal with the complaints. And these guidelines were things like, there needs to be a committee, the committee should have at least 50% women, it needs to meet certain criteria, there must be an external member to the committee and so on and so forth. And it is this internal committee where any sexual harassment complaint would be reported and they would deal with it swiftly. And they said that in the absence of any legislation, these guidelines would be law. And then eventually, many years later, the parliament did pass legislation on sexual harassment. So one would think that given that the Supreme Court was the front runner on this, and they are the ones who had actually come up with the guidelines. And given the fact that these are all members trained in law, they serve in the highest court of the country, that they would know what to do swiftly and justly. And what happened immediately after was a series of horrific events. So the first thing that happened was that the Secretary General of the Supreme Court, before anything, like overnight, before any committee had been formed or anything else, just said that these are mischievous and false accusations. They're trying to malign the institution. And it's like the opposition and other interfering forces are trying to reduce the stature of the judiciary. So first of all, it seems like there are other members of the staff who had already come out in judgment immediately after the affidavit and the complaint had been sent, even before anything else had been done. And this is obviously extremely inappropriate for any institution, but for the Supreme Court, it's really shocking. Immediately after that, what happened is the Chief Justice of India constituted a bench and in this particular bench to hear this matter, he sat on the bench himself along with two other justices, Justice Khanna and Justice Arun Mishra, not Deepak Mishra. So you can imagine that the most fundamental principle of natural justice, which is that one shall not sit in judgment of one's own cause was completely violated and by the highest judicial officer of the country. And in this particular bench, what they were determining was, it was in reference and they said they called it a matter of the highest public interest or public concern. And they basically sat in judgment on whether the complaint is valid or not, right? And you can imagine that the person heading the bench is the person against whom the complaint is made. So even someone completely untrained in law, a two year old would understand that this is not fair or just. Now when it was pointed out that this is a problem, by they I mean the Supreme Court decided to have an internal committee or an ICC as they call it in the Sexual Harassment at the Workplace Act. So the ICC had three justices, Justice Ramana, Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Bhopte. Now the problem was Justice Ramana before he sat on this particular internal committee had already revealed to the press that he thought this was a false complaint. So once again, someone who had already sat in judgment of the matter and really didn't have an open mind was placed on this committee. So when the complainant brought this to his attention, he had to recuse himself. The complainant also brought another fact to their attention saying that it had only one woman on the panel, whereas the POSH guidelines require that there should be at least 50% of the committee has to be women. So then they replaced Justice Ramana with Justice Indu Malhotra. And this particular panel sat and met, there were other violations of their own POSH guidelines, which is that there was no external member. She was not allowed to bring a lawyer to the proceedings. The proceedings weren't recorded. No external member was allowed to participate in it. And all this was basically some kind of like an internal mechanism to deal with a problem against their own superior. So it was very clear that the other justices were also floundering because basically they're hearing something against their boss. So in this kind of a panel, it's even more important that an external member be present and that external member be someone of a very, very high stature, which is quite easy for the Supreme Court. You know, they can bring in a retired justice, they can bring in a retired female justice, you know, like Justice Rumapal or someone else who has such a stellar reputation. So this could have very easily been avoided, but clearly they didn't want to avoid it. And finally, what happened is the complainant withdrew her complaint, not because she admitted that, you know, this was not a genuine complaint. She said she has absolutely no hope of getting a fair hearing or justice with this panel at this institution. And she is unfortunately right. And it just really distressed me like this entire series of events. It felt like the Supreme Court was doubling down on each mistake one after the other."

So this is a play of words and you could go either way with this. But yes, if you strictly think of it as the same rules that apply to everyone else must also apply to the members of the judiciary, then they are really violating all of those principles. In a very brazen way, like all this is not hidden. This is all happening in, it's playing out in the media, only partially playing out in the media. Frankly, the media was muzzled quite a bit. A lot of newspapers are scared to run stories about the Supreme Court because they're worried they'll be held in contempt. A lot of people are scared to speak up. The people most qualified to speak up are from the legal community who unfortunately have a lot of cases pending before the judiciary. So even though the Bar Council and the Supreme Court advocates on record and all these people came forward and they issued statements condemning the procedural mess, it's very difficult for scrutiny to come from people who really depend on the Chief Justice of India to get the matters through. So there's a really big problem, you know, systemic problem that is taking place."

        "message": "So this is the thing that is very worrying, right? So it seems like any time, so, okay, to me in a civilized society, no one should know names of specific justices, you know, to me, that would be the most civilized society of all. You know, maybe, you know, if there was a new Chief Justice sworn in or something, you know his name, but justice should be based on principles so much so that it doesn't have any individuals deep imprint on it. And we don't think of individuals as partisan and taking sides. When the government and cabinet ministers, the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, they all came out of the woodwork within hours, they completely rubbish the complaint and malign the reputation of the complainant without knowing all the facts because the complaint had been made like 48 hours before all this happened. And they immediately took the side of the Chief Justice, which shows that something is going on, right? They want, they think he's their guy or they want him to be at the helm and they don't want him to resign or be impeached and so on. So that makes one extremely suspicious of what is going on. And if you remember Chief Justice Gogoi, who was just a, you know, a senior justice prior to this, when Deepak Mishra was the Chief Justice, there was a press conference that before senior most judges held. And the only person who flipped his stance later was Justice Gogoi. And he was the next in line to be appointed Chief Justice of India. And it all seems very messy and complicated in terms of it's very opaque on how justices and Chief Justices are appointed and promoted. So it's very unclear where the alliances lie, and precisely why the current government and the current executive want to support this particular Chief Justice."

What are its duties? What is it supposed to do? So now, you know, we can get a clearer sense of what is going wrong specifically now. So take me back in time, like, you know, our modern justice system as it is now really came about in 1950, right?"

        "message": "Exactly. So a little bit before that, in the sense that we had a functioning set of high courts, and a federal court, which was called the British Federal Court, which eventually became the Supreme Court. Of course, at the time, the British Federal Court was not the highest court of appeal, the Privy Council in London was the highest court of appeal. So in that sense, you know, sort of the infrastructure we inherited from colonial times, but the constitution making process from 1946 to 1950, one of the big differences, so as you know, India inherited or at least pretty much exactly adopted the existing parliamentary system, right? So whatever was the British Westminster system was continued in India, and, you know, very few tweaks were made to it. But there was one major difference from the colonial government, which is England does not, or at least at that time, did not have independent judicial review. That is an American inheritance for us, right? What we mean by independent judicial review is that the judiciary will provide a check and a balance, both to the executive and to the legislature. So if the executive makes any kinds of actions, which are unconstitutional, the institution that will adjudicate whether or not it is unconstitutional, and then nullify that particular order is the judiciary. This comes from an old court case called Marbury versus Madison in America. That was the sort of the starting point of independent judicial review. Now in that particular case, it also applied to the legislature, right? Now this was not true of England. The parliament could only, was sovereign in England, sovereign in the sense, you know, in terms of checks and balances, and the courts could only review executive action, but they could not review legislative action, right? So this is one major difference between what was going on in England in 1950 and what was happening in India in 1950. And Ambedkar, who of course studied at Columbia and a whole host of other legal minds in India who were very inspired by the American system, thought that it is crucial to have independent judicial review in a constitutional setup that guarantees fundamental rights. So you need to have writ jurisdiction, which means there are a host of writs that individuals have where they can petition the court and say, my rights have been violated, and you need to look into this matter and therefore either approve or nullify the executive action or the particular, you know, bill or act, which has violated my rights. Now, incidentally, the court took to this immediately and very quickly, like all the justices who were justices at the time of the birth of the republic, they were very well versed with what independent judicial review means, even though they hadn't come from that system. So they knew how to interpret the law, they knew how to think about these principles, and they knew that for the constitution to have any real value, you need to be able to very clearly define when legislation and when executive action violates the constitution. And that's really where independent judicial review comes in from. Now, why is it important that this kind of judicial review is independent? It is so that the judiciary is not subject to the arbitrary actions of the executive for the legislature, right, that it has its own place. And one of the ways to make the judiciary independent is that its appointment procedure is independent, right? So that is really where this kind of system comes from. Ambedkar was a very big advocate to push through this kind of independent judicial review. And he felt that the judiciary must be both independent of the executive, but it also needs to be competent. So how do you balance these two things, right? Now, the executive represents the people of India after being elected through the legislature. They are the people who really govern, so they are the ones in charge of the appointments. But how do we make sure that the people making appointments are also removed from the people whom they appoint? So there are a whole host of procedures to make sure that the judiciary is independent. One of these is that no high court or Supreme Court judge can be removed except for an impeachment proceeding, right? So judicial officers at the highest courts can only be impeached, they can't just be, you know, dismissed. And they have a term which ends when they reach the age of 62 in the case of the high courts and 65 in the case of the Supreme Court. So they only retire based on their date of birth, right, they can't be manipulated and forced to retire early or pushed or get an extension or retire later. So there were a bunch of safeguards like this. And the most important part of this procedure was Article 124 for the Supreme Court appointments and Article 217 for the high court appointments, which basically said that the president shall make the appointment. And when we say the president, we really mean the cabinet, and he shall do so in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, right? And now, for the last 70 plus years, there is a huge question over what is the meaning of the word consultation, right? In case of a disagreement, whose voice prevails? You know, does the Chief Justice's view become binding? Does the cabinet's view become binding? And exactly how do you deal with this problem, right, when there is a disagreement? So that has been sort of the centerpiece of independence of judiciary in India for the last 70 years."

        "message": "So let me try to kind of recap that and tell me if I understood it correctly. Basically, it wasn't always the case that the judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature. And what Ambedkar did was he followed the American precedent of making it independent of both the executive and the legislature and the purpose of the judiciary therefore became to ensure that the rules that were set in the Constitution and our laws applied to everybody equally, including the executive and the legislature, which brings about the dilemma of how do you do this, if the judiciary itself is going to be appointed by the people who it's supposed to control? Because, you know, you and I have discussed and this was again a question I had for a later part, but might as well bring it up now is that, you know, the same way that we apply public choice theory to governments where we talk about, you know, the incentives in play, a, I guess the same principles would apply to the judiciary and B, in this case, it would seem to me that the incentives for those in government would always be to select pliant judges, and then keep seeding the Supreme Courts and the high courts with pliant judges and manipulate the system in that way. So what is sort of a history of those kinds of tensions playing out? And how has the judiciary stayed independent to begin with, for whatever time it did stay"

        "message": "independent? So you have really hit the pulse of the matter. So you and I have talked a lot about, you know, what are the kind of rules in place and what are the incentives based on the rules. But I want to also state the importance of convention and of statesman like leaders here a little bit. So in the 1950s, you know, when, so what happened was that the Chief Justice of the British Federal Court was Chief Justice Kanya, when we adopted the constitution. So the day we adopted the constitution, the British Federal Court became the Supreme Court of India, and Chief Justice Kanya became the Chief Justice of India. Okay, when Chief Justice Kanya died in office soon after, the next most senior justice was Justice Patanjali Shastri. Now it is believed that Nehru, who was at the time the Prime Minister and therefore representing the cabinet, he preferred Justice MC Mahajan, who was at the Bombay High Court at the time. And it was quite clear that that was his preference. But all the Supreme Court justices threatened to resign if the next most senior justice did not automatically become the Chief Justice. And that is really the beginning of the convention that the next senior most justice will become the Chief Justice and serve whether that term is for two days or for 10 years. You know, this is not written anywhere in the constitution, like there's no text that supports this, but it is convention. And it is also like we must applaud Nehru that when he felt that there was pushback from the judiciary on one of his decisions. And by the way, Justice MC Mahajan was a legendary judge, right? This is a time actually when the Supreme Court of India, which used to be the British Federal Court, was really not that important. You know, they were the highest court of appeal. They got very few cases, usually on like very boring matters of law. The busy and important courts for the high courts, they did the bulk of the work. So it was really your high court judges who were sort of superstars. And it seems like Nehru picked one such superstar, you know, who had, I mean, it's not like he just picked some random client guy, like he was really, by any standards, an excellent judge. But Nehru knew when to step back and respect the authority of institutions. And Nehru was so popular, frankly, he had said, yeah, go ahead and resign. You know, this is a country full of British trained lawyers. I can replace you guys tomorrow. He could have easily done that. But Nehru knew that there will never be respect for the Supreme Court if it wasn't viewed as independent by all the stakeholders in society. So he knew when to step back. So I want to, you know, sort of emphasize the importance of convention here. It is very difficult to put down every rule in writing and then interpret every rule, especially by the same court that, you know, needs to interpret the rule in its own matter. So in these kinds of situations, the convention really kicks in. And from 1951 to 1973, we had a very clear procedure of appointment. It was, of course, I mean, even in those years, there are some examples where it seems like there's some executive influence. But it largely seems like very good, qualified people were appointed, that the Chief Justice of India's opinion always had very, very high consideration or regard. And if there were politically motivated appointments or transfers, it wasn't a rampant thing. It might have been a one-off thing, right? So that's the situation until 1973. Now, you and I have talked about, in an episode, we've talked about property rights for over an hour. And if we just reference back to that episode, we talked about how the constitution kept getting amended by the parliament, especially by the Indira Gandhi government, because the judiciary kept interpreting the constitution as it is written, right? So one of the consequences of that was that if you keep amending the constitution, the courts are going to say, hey, this is very problematic. You can't just amend the constitution anytime we enforce the constitution. So in 1967, there's a case called Golaknath, where the Supreme Court in 11 judge bench held that the constitution is unamendable by the parliament, that fundamental rights cannot be amended. This was in 1967. Now the matter got appealed and in a case called Kesavanandarthi versus State of Kerala. And this was a 13 judge bench. Again, the question was, does the parliament have the authority to amend the constitution? And this is the case where the basic structure doctrine was created and the court basically said that the parliament has the authority to amend the constitution, but this is not an unlimited authority. There is a core to the constitution that is inviolable and unamendable. We call that the basic structure. Basically it is things like federalism, democracy, secularism, independent judiciary, and so on. And if the parliament amends any of these parts, we can strike down that constitutional amendment. Now, the interesting thing is in this particular case, the court didn't say exactly what the basic structure of the constitution is. They didn't give us a list, right? They said, we will know when we see it, we'll decide on a case by case basis. There's a lot of politics and it's a fascinating story how this case came about, but the decision was given on April 24, 1973, which was also the last date of the term of Chief Justice Sikri. So Chief Justice Sikri knew that this is going to create a huge fallout. And as soon as it is announced, they wrote their separate opinions. Chief H.R. Khanna was one of the instrumental people in coming up with the basic structure of the constitution. And it was a seven, six judgment. And there were like lots of dissenting opinions, really convoluted, it runs into thousands of pages. And one of the justices who wholeheartedly was on the side of the government was Justice A.N. Ray. So when Chief Justice Sikri retired, there were three justices, right? Justice Shellach, Justice Grover, Justice Hegde, who were next in line. And then there was Justice A.N. Ray. Now Indira Gandhi, knowing that these justices had sided against the government in this particular opinion, violated what is the fundamental principle of independent judiciary, which is that justices must not be rewarded or penalized for their judicial opinions. So the day after Sikri retires, instead of appointing the next in line, she supersedes three senior judges and then appoints Justice A.N. Ray as the Chief Justice of India. And this is the first time anything like this had happened in India. It was like a complete shock. Of course, this is the time of like great statesman. And within a day, justices Shellach, Grover, Hegde, all of them resigned from the bench, right? So in a sense, Indira Gandhi got exactly what she wanted. She superseded three justices who were against her, which created three vacancies. And now she had A.N. Ray, who was known as her man, though it's not clear if there was any specific reward and punishment system between A.N. Ray and the government. And she was hoping that A.N. Ray will reconstitute a bench within a month or so and re-look at Keshavanand Bharti. Now, thankfully, that didn't happen. And that's a whole other story. But this is the first instance of this kind of seniority being violated. Indira Gandhi also started or at least pushed forth the trend of transferring justices when they gave opinions against the government, right? This is most evident in cases like ADM, Shivkanth Shukla. This is the habeas corpus case at the peak of the emergency, right? And Justice Rangarajan, who was then the high court judge, who gave the judgment, was immediately transferred to Guwahati High Court, which is kind of a penalty posting, as they say, right? There are some big high courts from where you typically get moved up, and that's what happened to Justice Rangarajan. Justice HR Khanna, who when, you know, ADM Shivkanth Shukla was appealed to the Supreme Court, he gave his opinion against the government and against the government actions and held up the fundamental rights of individuals. And when he was the next senior most justice, he was superseded, right? So once again, Justice Baig, who was junior to Justice HR Khanna, was made chief justice by superseding HR Khanna, immediately the day after HR Khanna resigned, right? So there were these two instances where senior Supreme Court judges were superseded, where justices at the high court and the Supreme Court were transferred for things that they, you know, did in their professional capacity, enforcing independent judicial review, which was their job. And this was really a huge attack on the institution of the independence of the judiciary. Meanwhile, during the emergency, the Indira Gandhi government also passed the 42nd Amendment, which severely restricted independent judicial review, you know, and thankfully the emergency ended and Janata government, which came in 77, 78, undid a lot of the 42nd Amendment and the 43rd and 44th Amendment, and they restored all the rules of the judiciary back to the 1950 set of rules, right? So all the mischief was in some sense undone, but the judiciary has never recovered from this blow in the sense that there is always a feeling that there is too much executive interference and there's always a threat that if any Supreme Court or high court judge gives an opinion that is against the government, the government uses all of its influence and might to try to undermine the career of that particular judge or to transfer them or to make sure that they are never appointed to the Supreme Court if they're a high court judge and so on and so forth. So this is really the core of the fallout of the actions of Indira Gandhi, right? So this stuff was brewing a little bit before her also, but before her, we had leaders who were statesmen who knew when to stop, you know, the rules were equally unclear all along, but the statesmen knew when to stop and when not to push."

        "message": "So I have kind of three related questions. And what you just said kind of brought me back to the sort of the first of them. And I'll ask the first two together. And the thing is, you and I both agree, and we've often written about how democracies and systems of government can't rely on having good people and great leaders at the top. Instead, what you need is good rules and good structures. So that even if somebody who is a demagogue or a bad person comes to power, they can't really do much damage. What is important are sort of the rules in place. And the first part of this narrative about the independence of the judiciary seems to rely on, to begin with, in the first instance, the statesmanship of Nehru in letting that convention be established at the senior most judge be made the Chief Justice of India, and not insisting on Justice Mahajan getting that post. And then that convention continues, because like you said that they were sort of all these statesmen who were doing the right thing. But then the point is, you can't rely on statesmen doing the right thing for the system to work. So my question, therefore, is that, again, like two questions. Question number one, what kind of rules should there have been in place that could possibly have enforced that kind of independence of the judiciary, number one? And number two, how does it work in other countries, where also the judiciary is notionally independent? Like, would the US be an example of another such country? And there also the appointment of Supreme Court judges is very politicized, isn't it?"

Having said that, people do interpret the rules, right? So when there are good people, the same set of rules, good or bad, tend to come up with slightly better outcomes than when they are bad people. But your larger point is absolutely right. Rules need to be robust to even the worst kind, right? My dissertation advisor, Peter Bedke, always used to say, you don't write rules as if Mother Teresa is going to enforce them. You write rules as if Joseph Stalin is going to enforce them."

I mean, it would be charitable to say that the framers goofed this up, but they really did mess it up. You know, a consultation, deliberation, these are not the kinds of words that you want to have in a constitutional document. You want to have very, very clear procedures on how people are appointed, right? So second, if you do put in the word consultation because you want it to be an amicable decision as opposed to, you know, pitting one institution against the other, you still need to clarify who has supremacy in case of disagreement, right? Now in any kind of panel, even judicial benches, we have an odd number of members on the panel. Now why do we do that? Now in an ideal world, we would like opinions to be unanimous or not just have a narrow majority, but we still have an odd number because if it's an even number, it could be a split and then you don't know where to go from there, right? So even our common sense panels and decisions always have odd numbers, right? So now odd number panel, those are conventions. Those are not like they are not written in the text of the Constitution, but it's such a strong and commonsensical and obvious convention. But the reason for the convention is to break deadlock, right? So having words like consultation and not having a backup procedure to break deadlock when the consultative process fails, in my opinion, that is probably the biggest flaw in Article 124, Article 217 and Article 222, which is about transfer of judges. So one possible defense in the framers is that they were genuinely extraordinary statesmen. You know, the people who crafted our constitution, because they were surrounded by other people like them who were so well-meaning and so well-educated and so public spirited in their service. I think they imagined that is the quality of leaders we will elect and they didn't think that there would be a possibility of future elected leaders who would be self-serving and violate these documents so badly. So that is the most charitable thing I can say in defense of the framers. Now coming to your second question, you're absolutely right. It is complicated the world over, different countries have different procedures for appointment. In America, the way they have ensured judicial independence is to have a life term appointment at the Supreme Court level, right? And there are pros and cons of this kind of appointment. So the pro is once you get on the Supreme Court bench in the US Supreme Court, you serve until the end of, you know, whenever you choose to step down for medical or health reasons or when you die. So it's a life appointment, right? And that means that justices can serve on the Supreme Court bench for 40 years, 50 years if you appoint someone young, right? So that's that. And over 50 years, you are going to give countless decisions every year, but you cannot be penalized for any of those decisions, nor can you be rewarded for any of those decisions because there is no job waiting for you after that."

Right, they can't do anything to influence me after that, after that, I'm sort of in a bubble. Now, it just so happens that the vetting process is so detailed, they pull out law review articles and op-eds you wrote when you were 19 years old. And they're very, very, very careful that you hold the views that you say you hold. Having said that, if they appoint someone to the Supreme Court bench at age 45 or 50, and it's a life appointment, and you're on the bench for the next 40 years, who says you can't change your mind? You know, who says you can't change your mind the very next day? Now, the Indian Supreme Court works a little bit differently. The retirement age was 65, because at the time of the founding of the country, the life expectancy wasn't that high. But today, 65 is a very low retirement age, given that life expectancy has increased. So what's happening is most Supreme Court judges take on some role immediately after they retire from the Supreme Court, and it typically tends to be government tribunals and panels. And guess who appoints people to the government tribunal and panels? It's the executive. So now you have this very big problem of post-judicial appointments. And there has been some very interesting research on this particular issue. So I know we're reading a little bit of what we were talking about just a minute ago. But I want to emphasize that appointment procedure is not the only way to be independent. There are other important ways to be independent, which is what is the salary that is given to a judge, which is whether judges are transferred between high courts, which doesn't happen in America. Right? I mean, every state is its own sort of like contained unit. You're not transferring judges from one state to another. So that is another kind of mechanism. And it's a lifetime appointment. So a couple of years ago, Madhav Ane, Shubhankar Dam and Giovanni Koh, they actually looked at post-retirement appointments of Supreme Court judges and compared them to whether these judges authored favorable judgments in important cases just before they retired. And guess what they find?"

And they're basically fitted on this tribunal or that tribunal, you know, Election Commission, Right to Information Commission, this office, that office, there's a whole host of appointments that is possible. It makes a significant difference to the pay and the lifestyle of these justices. So while all the focus has been on appointment procedure alone, that is not the only way to be independent. We have managed to create a very pliant judiciary even when the appointment procedure is not interfered with, right? By post-retirement carrots, so to speak. So there are many differences and there are many ways to skin this cat. So if you think about it, the U.S. Supreme Court has nominees are appointed by the executive, but they are vetted by the legislature, which is you need a Senate confirmation hearing, right? So that is highly political process. It is not at all independent, but somehow it manages to protect the independence of the judge once the judge is on the bench and becomes a Supreme Court justice, right? So you can have a very political process and that still ensures independence, or you can have a very insular process, which is completely separate from the politics and still have a not so independent system."

        "message": "So again, I want to take you back a little bit to the history of what happened, you know, so post Indira Gandhi's actions in the 70s and the horror of the emergency, transferring so many judges during the emergency really became like a farce, what was going on. The legal community thought that it needs to do something, right? So there were a series of challenges on appointment procedure, because, you know, it became very clear that the appointment and the transfer procedure is not very clear and we need to come up with something. So the first of these cases is called the first judges case. It was in 1982, S.P. Gupta versus Union of India. And in this particular case, the court was asked, so exactly what does this consultative process mean, right? So the court simply said that it limited the unfettered power of the executive, right? The consultation should be full, the chief justice's opinion must be recorded, it must be considered, it can't be easily disregarded. Having said that, the chief justice of India's opinion on appointments and transfers is not binding. Right? So that was the first judges case. Now, this is a very traditional interpretation because nowhere in the constitution does it seem to suggest that the judiciary's opinion on appointments should be binding. So in a sense, even in the 1980s, the Supreme Court justices were not very activist and still conservative and they were interpreting the text of the constitution. But as we know, since the 80s, after post-emergency, there was like a two-year Janata government period. And then after that, it was back to politics as usual. So all the usual shenanigans started. And there was a really important question of how do we really protect the independence of judges? And this brings me to the second judges case, right? This was a case in 93, and it was basically the legal community, the Supreme Court's advocates on record who questioned once again, the existing procedure in articles 124, 217, and 222, right? And they said, there are poor procedural safeguards. So what do we do now? This is perhaps the most activist judicial opinion written, not just by the Supreme Court of India, but any court anywhere in the world, right? They basically created a new procedure to appoint Supreme Court and high court judges out of thin air. And if you compare the procedure to what is the text of the constitution, you will think you are in two different countries and the pages got mixed up. Okay. So what they did was they said, we're going to create a collegium system. The collegium is led by the Supreme Court of India and two of the senior most judges. And these three people will come up with a list of who needs to be appointed and who needs to be transferred. And they will give this list to the cabinet or the president who actually, in whose name the appointments are made and their recommendations are binding and they cannot be violated. Okay. Now, as you can see, this is a drastically different system from what was actually written in text. Some people thought this was the most amazing thing that had ever happened. And the judiciary had finally come of age and declared its own independence. Many others felt that this is outrageous and very self-serving activism. And this is going to create a situation where there is no external scrutiny or check on the judiciary. And it's basically a self-appointing system, right? Only the current chief justice of India determines who are the next people who rise to the bench. So it's extremely problematic. A presidential reference was made in 1998. The president of India can ask the Supreme Court to clarify on matters of law or national importance and so on. And this presidential reference in 1998, again, the court put in a few more safeguards to this collegium system. So it's called the third judge's case. So they added some more safeguards to the second judge's case. They said that, you know, the collegium must meet and the minutes must be recorded. It must be a transparent system. And the collegium is going to be not this chief justice of India plus two judges, but chief justice of India and the next four senior most judges. So the collegium will have five people, right? And this will be the group that determines who is appointed and who will be promoted to the Supreme Court and so on. And they will give their list to cabinet and the president will make these appointments. Now once again, coming to the importance of convention, when all this was happening in 1998, you can imagine that if it had been Indira Gandhi, who was the prime minister, she would have just shut the whole thing down, right? But it just so happened that people who had lived through the emergency and, you know, better, more statesmen leaders were beginning to come to power. And immediately after that is the time of Vajpayee, right? And it seems to be quite clear that everyone in the executive thought that this is a very bad idea, but they shouldn't mess with the independence of the judiciary. And they should respect this opinion, right? So presidential reference was made. Once the Supreme Court clarified the matter, the matter was left alone. So from 1993 until 2015, we had a second system of appointments, which was by collegium. And before that, you know, from 1951 to 1993 was the first system of appointments, which was by consultation, right? Aside from the shenanigans of Indira Gandhi. So this was really what was going on. Now you don't need much of a legal education to guess what would happen in a system like this. So, you know, the usual, which is nepotism, which is not the most qualified people rising to the bench, but people who have connections, right? So if you have served and you had on good relationships with the sort of like the elite judicial coterie, then you are promoted, a lot of children and grandchildren and siblings of past justices were promoted and they rose to the top. And some internal corruption really started setting into the court system. So there was a time when the court system was really beyond reproach. You know, giants had served on the court and they were really, they held themselves to such a high standard and never put a foot out of place. And it was really important that they not only did what is right, but also seemed to do what is right, which is, you know, hold themselves to a higher standard. Now, all of them that started disappearing under the collegium system and it became quite clear that the Supreme Court and all the judges were a little bit like, you know, power drunk and they thought they could do whatever they wanted. This is, you know, the eighties, nineties, and since the 2000s, especially the nineties and the 2000s is also the most activist form of the judiciary. So the Supreme Court butts its head into every policy matter. It is legislating from the bench, it passes daily orders on all matters from taxation, which was never under its purview to the powers of pretty much every other institution, right? So the Supreme Court has become its own powerful giant and this entire, you know, sort of jugglery trick worked because the people had a lot of faith in the institution. So as long as the public supports you, in a sense, you can sort of get away with a lot of procedural problems, right? So the people of India thought the Supreme Court is this hallowed institution and that's really where we get justice through specially petitions and public interest litigations and all of those things. And it seems to be the last uncorrupted bastion. So the Supreme Court got away with this for a long time. And then once the corruption started becoming more and more public is when, you know, sort of the music stopped and you had to take stock."

And my next question following on from what you were speaking about before the break is really about judicial activism. I mean, forgive the newbie question, but my impression of the judiciary always was that look, the judges are basically supposed to interpret what the laws are or what the Constitution says and their judgments are on the basis of that. Their own opinions don't really matter, they can't, to use that phrase, legislate from the bench. It's the job of the legislature to legislate. And what the Supreme Court simply does is that it interprets existing laws and the Constitution and pass the judgments based on that. Now, a number of the judgments that we've spoken about in this episode, whether it's, for example, the basic structure judgment, where I wonder on the basis of what do they decide what the basic structure is of the Constitution doesn't mention that, or the 1993 second judge's case, where they decide that there should be a collegium and this is a procedure and blah, blah, blah, on the basis of what do they decide that or even the Vishakha judgment, which both of us agree is excellent and a really positive move forward. But on the basis of what do they arrive at something, because the point is that once you accept that the judges have a right to sort of legislate from the bench as it were, then depending on which people are on the bench, they can legislate absolutely anything, right?"

And I finally come to the point that no matter which view you take, the Indian Supreme Court is still doing the wrong thing. Okay. So the first view is, look, it is always the job of the court to be conservative and not activist. And what do we mean by activists? Now there are two ways to think about the role of the judiciary, right? So the first is it provides a check and balance. So you know, whatever the executive and the legislature do to preserve principles of natural justice and the spirit of the constitution, you need to provide a valid check. Now, based on this kind of interpretation, if your legislature and executive are going bonkers, it means your judiciary can go bonkers, right? So if you have a legislature, which is repeatedly amends the constitution, then you're going to end up placing the judiciary in a situation where they may also have to exceed their powers a little bit or their original powers a little bit, or get more creative with their interpretation to actually give a solid check to the legislature and the executive. So this kind of activism, most legal scholars are quite comfortable with in the sense that they feel that the job of the judiciary is to really pursue in a very spirited way, really pursue the protection of individual rights and the constitution. So in this sense, a lot of the activism that happens during the emergency, you know, like Justice HR Khanna's opinion in Keshavanand Bharti or Jabalpur versus ADM Shivkanth Shukla. These are all legendary cases where there could have been a textbook interpretation and they went a step ahead of the textbook interpretation. But the goal was still to protect individual rights and it wasn't self-serving in the sense that it wasn't increasing the power of the judiciary."

The second part of it is a very Adam Smith division of labor kind of view of the judiciary. In fact, Adam Smith writes about this in The Wealth of Nations, that there are two roles. One is the functional task, which is, you know, the judiciary's job is really to go through a lot of evidence procedure and actually adjudicate. And that's a highly specialized task, right? The legislature's job is to amalgamate preferences of millions of people. And that's the legislature's job. The executive's job is to execute the goals of the government, you know, as conveyed by the legislature or the preferences of the people. So these are three very fundamentally different tasks. You know, this is as different as the butcher, the brewer and the baker. So in that sense, the one way to think about judicial activism is you're really doing jobs which are outside your expertise and outside your purview, which is why you must be limited. So you know, things like fiscal matters, about taxation, about government spending, about, you know, I'll give you a good example of this. Now think of the CNG cases.

So this was when the early 2000s, I was in high school, just starting college. Overnight, the court just, you know, there were a series of cases by MC Mehta, who was sort of like this environmental activist. And he said, you know, people of Delhi can't breathe, and you can imagine he said this like 20 years ago. Right. Can you imagine what they would say today? They said the biggest problem is all the particulate matter that comes out of these diesel buses. We need to make sure that all the diesel buses change to CNG overnight. Okay. Now think about what it takes to change an entire fleet of government and private buses. You need an infrastructure. First of all, these buses need to exist. Then you need to refit them. Once you refit them, every petrol pump in the city needs to outfit itself with a CNG station. Right. Now, the court simply said, change 10,000 buses to CNG. They gave them a deadline. The Delhi government violated the deadline. They gave them a second deadline, the Delhi government violated the deadline. Supreme Court got so sick of the Delhi government, they just said, diesel buses cannot fly after such and such date. And overnight it was like a Soviet Union. Yeah. I mean, there were no buses and all the autos and buses, we, even the ones that had CNG, the lines outside the petrol stations and the CNG stations were, I mean, you really thought you're living in a shortage Soviet style economy. Like these four auto rickshaw and bus drivers would stand in line for three or four days to get one tank full of CNG and then continue again. So now if you think about this from the point of view of the, you know, functional separation of powers, not just the checks and balances, this is about specialization and knowledge, right? The courts, which basically adjudicate disputes, which are over a matter of fact or matter of law, they simply don't know how to execute a transition from system A to system B, which is a question of governance. That is squarely in the pocket of the executive. The court said, Oh, we didn't know that, you know, there will be the CNG problem. It's like a classic knowledge problem, right? Of course you can overnight convert and say the buses are going to run on CNG, but you can't produce CNG out of thin air and make it available exactly where the people need it to be available. This would have required the Delhi state government issuing new licenses to all the petrol pumps, creating new petrol pumps with CNG. You know, it's a whole infrastructure that takes place and the government knew about it. And it's so funny that the Supreme Court justices who are very smart people didn't know about it because it's simply not within their purview to know this. On the second matter, which is this question of, you know, the functional knowledge to execute on some of these tasks, those are the more like very problematic questions of judicial interference or judicial activism. You have ludicrous examples of this. So the Delhi High Court at one point was trying to legislate or standardize the height of speed breakers in Delhi. Is it really the job of the courts to decide what the height of speed breakers is? And I'll tell you how the matter came about. Resident welfare associations were randomly building speed breakers near schools or in front of their house to reduce the number of accidents, right? Because we have such poor sort of traffic rule following spirit in India. So people were doing all this and they realized that all the speed breakers are of uneven heights, which apparently is a matter of national importance. Someone filed a public interest litigation and the public interest litigation now decided whether or not you can have speed breakers and how high these speed breakers should be. And you think about it and you're like, really, the pendency of cases is extraordinary at this point. There are people in jail who are being deprived of their rights because the cases are going on for too long. There are land dispute cases where the original parties to the case have died waiting for justice. And the Supreme Court thinks that the most important thing is to legislate from the bench on CNG and the, you know, Delhi Bird Sanctuary and the air quality and the height of speed breakers. And this list has become extremely long. There is virtually no area of Indian governance where the Supreme Court has not given its opinion one way or another."

I'll give you another example of activism in the Supreme Court. Okay. And how this activism can be very problematic. So one of the reasons that the activism started in the 1980s was as a social justice program, you know, bonded laborers, you know, this is a Badua Mukti Mocha case that came out of the mining community. They were like mine workers and bonded laborers who were just living like such a horror in their daily life and their workplace. And they didn't have much voice or agency, right? And through a series of cases, the court started interfering and actually assigning positive rights. And another very interesting thing that the Supreme Court did at the time was it reduced what is called the locus standi requirement, right? Normally in any court case, the parties to the case need to show that they have standing. You know, if you wanted to use a very contemporary economic term, it would be skin in the game, right? They have to show that they're actually affected parties in this particular dispute and that's why they're coming to court. Now the court said, you know, a lot of the people who are deprived of human rights, like children, like minorities, Dalits, bonded laborers, they really don't have the agency to come forward and represent themselves. So if a public interested or public spirited human being came to represent them, we will allow it. Right? Now you can imagine this is such a great thing, right? I mean, like diluting locus standing so that we can help slum dwellers and we can help bonded laborers seems like such a, it seems like activism, but the right kind of activism. Now let me explain the problem with this. Random people come out of the woodwork representing problems where they are not directly affected, right? And if you represent problems where you're not directly affected, one, there is an incentive problem, but there is also a knowledge problem. Delhi lawyers who live in elite Delhi areas and Delhi judges who don't take auto rickshaws and don't take buses are legislating on matters where they have no skin in the game and they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. And the other side parties end up being underrepresented. Now let me give you the worst example of diluting locus standard requirements. Now if you remember our entire journey in our country with section 377, originally the Delhi high court in the NAS foundation case had struck down 377 and upheld the right to same sex consensual relationships, right? This was a Delhi high court judgment. This court appealed to the Supreme court and the Supreme court overturned it, right? This was all the drama that took place before what happened last year. Now if you look at Supreme court overturning the Delhi high court case and you actually look into the matter, you'll notice that NAS foundation did not appeal the Delhi high court judgment. Okay. The government at the time, which was the UPA government and the Delhi government did not appeal the case, even though they lost. They said, you know, the courts have spoken, we leave it be, we are okay with 377 being struck down. The person who actually appealed the case was a Hindu astrologer. Second, this Hindu astrologer was not a party to the original suit. So it's like there are two, you know, teams playing cricket and now someone who was neither a player, nor the umpire, nor the spectator, but was, you know, standing and eating mangoes outside suddenly comes in and says, I think this game and its outcome was unfair. And the court heard it and they had to, because they are bound now by their own precedent of diluting standing requirements. And if anyone can come and appeal anything, guess what? Anyone will come and appeal anything. And that is so according to me, that Supreme court case was not just bad law, it was bad procedure because they just randomly allowed, you know, a third party who had nothing to do with the case to come in a little too late and they heard the appeal and then they overturned the case. So according to me, you know, all the activism of the Supreme court got in the way of all the activism of the Supreme court, right? This is the problem with having these terrible inconsistent set of rules and not binding yourself with procedure. So when you're asking broader question of judicial activism, some of it has held us in good stead because I have to say in a world where no other institution was really checking the power of the government, it was only the judiciary. Now the poor outcome of that is the judiciary grew too big for its own boots. It interfered in everything from the speaker's powers to election commission, to how parliament must be run, to how tax policy must be made. Now we are in a giant mess where it is very difficult to roll back this kind of authority without actually interfering with the independence of the courts. And so now what do we do is kind of the big question going forward."

You know, there was a lot of support for the Supreme Court activism as long as it was advocating genuinely for the powers of others. You know, the Vishakha case is a classic example. Did they legislate from the bench? Yes. As a constitutional economist, do I think that's a good idea? Absolutely not. Right. But was that public support and intellectual support and legal support for the case? Absolutely. I mean, worldwide, it was a landmark judgment. It has been cited in opinions in Europe, in America, in Africa. It's really an extraordinary case in the sense that the court stepped up when virtually no other public institutions stepped up. And frankly, they made rules, right? They put in rules and guidelines, which is what the courts do from time to time. They fill in gaps in law. Now, in this case, of course, they created law from scratch, but it is still somewhat within their functional expertise, but it was not self-serving, right? If you look at the second and third judge's case, it's a completely self-serving document, right? It is all about their power. Now think about it. If you were genuinely interested in independence of judiciary, wouldn't you increase retirement age and completely ban Supreme Court justices from taking any government appointment after their term is over? That is crucial to independence, right? But they don't really care about independence. They care about the fact that they should be allowed to do whatever they want, but also have their cake and eat it too, right? So if they want to go the other way and lobby for some government posting, they should be allowed to do that too. So I think the court has been very self-serving and disingenuous. So in some sense, this is not so much about rules and checks and balances, but about the functional legitimacy of the court. People are more likely to accept an activist court than the activist court is once again run by statesmen who know when to do the right thing, and we have not had those people. Now the public choice in you and me would say, hey, these horrible rules would never produce the right people, right? The worst get on top, true. But once upon a time, we did have genuine statesmen, activists as they were, right? Krishna here was an extremely activist judge, wrote horrible judgments, created a lot of problems in labor law and labor jurisprudence that we have until today. But none of it was self-serving."

And I think the same reason would apply to justices to some extent as well, which is that it's a residue of a time where the incentives were different for people to get into politics. If you got into politics or public service in those days, there wasn't so much in it for you, you were less likely to be driven by the lust for power or money. I mean, obviously, none of our freedom fighters had access to any of that in any case. And you were more likely to be animated by higher principles. And I'd say that it's kind of inevitable that given the shoddy rules that we have, that we will end up over a period of time with a bunch of scoundrels, both in politics and in the judiciary."

And if the bad rules and systems continue over a period of long time, then there is no question that eventually that group will take over. And that's exactly what has happened with the judiciary. You know, we talk about dynastic politics and nepotism, there is no institution with greater nepotism than the court system in India. You know, I mean, we have way more number of father-son, you know, Supreme Court justices pairs than we have, you know, father-son or brother pairs of chief ministers or prime ministers or something like that. Now, there is a, one part of it is all of India is dynastic, right, you know, the son of a potter becomes a potter kind of problem, but there is also a question of nepotism and connections and, you know, do you know how to navigate the system and hobnob with the right people such that they nominate you to the bench. And when the judicial system is completely insular in its appointment systems, this is just far more likely to happen. Also, this is the kind of situation where you get a lot of possibilities of sexual harassment and so on. Right. Now, think about it. If the Chief Justice of India, now that's not what happened in the current case. The current case, the complainant is not a judge, okay, but is a staff member. But you can very easily imagine, right, if enough women make it to the bench, the day is not far that if all the appointments are controlled by these five men right on top, that they can abuse their power. Now, we haven't had that problem yet because there are so few women in the system. You know, I don't know if that's a benefit or a problem, but so far we haven't had that. But very soon you're going to see those kinds of problems also. And I think the biggest problem is when the court system does things like this, it is legitimacy in the eyes of the public. Justice must be done, but it must also seem to be done, right? In some sense, this is all a bit of a magic trick, right? We all believe that magic is happening and then it's happening. Now, if we start questioning that this is really not what it seems to be, the whole institution will come down like a pack of cards because the court doesn't really have any power of its own aside from public legitimacy. It doesn't control the purse strings and it doesn't control the sword, right? So the court system only survives if the people who are vested in the court system think that it has a right to exist. So if there are more situations like this, which is basically a problem propagated by the appointment system, but if there are more situations like Chief Justice Mishra who sat in his own cause and same as this current Chief Justice Gogoi who sat in a matter in his own cause, very soon that legitimacy will be lost. So that's a problem and it can't be fixed overnight. You can get rid of a bad judge overnight, but this public legitimacy, it just can't"

And you know, he made a very similar point to what you're making now, where he spoke about how our Supreme Court has a diversity problem. And in my mind, the ramification of this is not just in terms of representation and so on in a democracy, but also it impacts decision making, like one of the best books I've read in the last few years is a book by Philip Tetlock called Super Forecasting, which refers to a study which showed that the most important parameter for good decision making is diversity. It's not intelligence, it's not knowledge, it's not or any of those things, but diversity. And the more diverse that a group is, the more likely you are to make good decisions. For example, you spoke about the judicial activism of the Delhi High Court earlier, where they spoke about, you know, all the buses have to go CNG. And you imagine that if the court was diverse enough that there are people who've actually grown up riding around in buses and auto rickshaws, maybe they might have had greater foresight in that situation and not done what they did. But that aside, so you know, what I see here is a worst of both possible worlds. On the one hand, the judiciary is not quite independent from the executive because of bad incentives in play, such as post retirement options, where the government can always hold out carrots in front of judges and say that, okay, after you retire, this is what you get and you get that car with the red button on top. And on the other hand, it is also too powerful in and of itself because it controls the appointment process through the collegium, the second judge's case of 1993, as you pointed out, a case of judicial activism, which was actually self-serving. So this is like a double problem now."

        "message": "Absolutely. How do we solve this? It's very difficult to solve it. So you know, in, you know, all credit to the Modi government, they tried, okay, they passed a constitutional amendment, which was called the NJAC, you know, the National Judicial Collegium. They amended article 124 to 17, and basically they changed the appointment procedure in the formal text of the constitution. So it was a full constitutional amendment, right? And this constitutional amendment basically said that the collegium will not just have members of the judiciary. So the collegium will be the chief justice of India and two justices, but it will also represent the law minister. So one position out of six will go to the executive, three positions out of six will be the judiciary. That is the CJI and the next two senior most justices. And it had a provision that there will be two eminent persons who will be on this collegium, right? And I think the idea behind this was, look, there is a problem with the executive having a 50% stake because, you know, the government of India, both the union and the state governments is the largest litigant before the court, right? So in that sense, it's a problem to have too much representation. So they kept it down to one person, right? And they had this for, you know, two eminent people from society sort of provision. And there was also provision that there should be enough women and minorities, right? Within the group that chooses these eminent persons and three from the judiciary. Now, it is not the best system according to me, but I think it would have still been an improvement over the current system, right? Because there was a genuine recognition that the executive needs to participate, but not participate too much. And the Supreme Court struck this constitutional amendment down saying it violates the basic structure and went back to the system of the collegium."

        "message": "of the basic structure. Yeah, using the basic structure. So this is a problem. And then what happened was, I mean, the executive is also clever. So the cabinet didn't appoint judges for a long time. You know, I think this last week we are finally operating at a full strength of the bench, right? So the chief justice would send names and the cabinet just won't appoint them. So what can you do? Right? So they were in deadlock, which basically meant justice suffered because the bench is not operating at its full strength, right? So the cabinet was very clever in that they didn't do anything overt. But they also knew when to dig their heels. So now it is a more collaborative process, but there are some other very big problems with this, right? Now let's say they wanted to be completely insular. That is, it was the chief justice of India plus four justices. It would be so much better still if they made the procedure transparent. That is, if the collegium sat and they actually took down minutes to the meeting. In every meeting they told you how many of the members of these five, you know, members of the collegium support every appointment or oppose every appointment. None of this exists. You know, since the second judge's case, and you know, it's confirmation in the third judge's case, we don't have any minutes to collegium meetings. They don't exist. Right? And if they did exist, which institution has the authority to subpoena them? No one. So how can we demand to see these minutes? So the procedures that came about in the third judge's case, which the Supreme Court had enforced, they are not being followed by the Supreme Court. So the Supreme Court is sort of running its own like gundaraj kind of thing, right? It does whatever it wants. Justice Chellameshwar actually came forward and said that I am in the collegium, but it is not recording meetings and it's not recording dissent, right? If you remember last year, there was that famous press conference by the four senior most judges against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra about the master of the roster and all of those things. And one of those issues was also the collegium. So there is a really big problem in that the courts think that any requirement of disclosure or scrutiny is a threat to their independence, which is simply not true. I mean, this is just really, it's sort of like, you know, in the Soviet, the Duma, there was one of the protections was that there can't be any criminal charges against members of the Duma. So guess what happened? All the criminals ended up in the Duma, right? So it's one of those sort of things where if you create a system where you are completely above scrutiny, then only those people who really wish to be above scrutiny are going to lobby for these spots. All good decent people are going to sort of stay away from the system because if you're not a politically motivated judge, you won't survive in this current judicial jungle of the collegium. So this is sort of the problem. There are some other problems also, like the retirement age is frankly too low. And particularly with reference to the high court. So you know, the high court retirement age is 62. So the way it works is mostly Supreme Court justices are promoted up from the high court and mostly it is when the high court judges retire. So the average term of a Supreme Court justice is just around two years. And the average term of a chief justice is about six to eight months. We've had chief justices who've served three weeks because of the seniority rule. So there is a lot of churn at the top, you know, so that is one very, very big problem. That's a diversity problem also, because if most of your judges are coming up from the high court, then you are getting a very sort of like monochromatic picture of what the judiciary needs to look like. Everyone looks the same and has the same kind of experience. Now, if you read books about the judiciary originally by George Gadboy, you know, who's done profiles of all the judges, you will notice that even initially both the high court and the Supreme Court were mostly men, upper caste Brahmin men who had some legal training and had family, which was like a family of lawyers, right? So there wasn't too much diversity when we began either, but it seems to have gotten worse. There was a little more diversity of thought because they came from different high courts and different backgrounds personally, but now it's all very elite, upper caste, privileged people whose family have excellent legal and political connections who are sort of moving up the bench in the court system. And there is a really big problem of minority representation in terms of other religions, women, Dalit community. It's a really big problem right now, right? So it's both diversity of individuals in terms of identity and also diversity of ideas. Like you said, you know, if you've never ridden in a bus, you don't know the problems of shutting down a bus service. So it's a little bit of both. And the Supreme Court is now completely captured by this mess. And it's not easy in terms of what is the way out of this. I mean, the new Modi government could have some renewed pressure. You know, I mean, this new term has got such a loud and large mandate in favor of Narendra Modi and given the complete mess that has been made by the Supreme Court in the last year and a half, it is possible that if another constitutional amendment is pushed forth with a sensible set of appointment rules and procedures, it is possible that the public will support the government and not the Supreme Court for the first time in a very long time. So there are some possibilities."

I really mean, in terms of points of fact and points of law, these judges seem to have just come out of nowhere, and they seem to just write whatever flies into their mind. And there is no sensible reasoning. Reason has left the Supreme Court building completely. So that is, I think, the greatest loss in all of this. We are having a huge body of law, but that law has no reason in it. So it is not very useful in terms of being binding as, you know, precedent in the future, because we don't have any sensible, like, doctrinal analysis on why is it that the courts have come to this opinion or, you know, landed on one side or the other side in this particular case.

They tried to do it through a proper constitutional amendment procedure and the amendment had a lot of problems, but it wasn't the worst thing that had been suggested and it was probably an improvement over the past. So that is the first thing I want to say about that. The second is, I think the revolution has to come from within if it has to have legitimacy.

And what Ulysses does is quite interesting. He pours wax into the ears of all his men so that they are not distracted by the sound of the sirens. And then he ties himself to the mast of the ship and tells his men not to untie him, right? So this is basically like the legend or the mythical version. The idea is that you must tie your own hands because you know that your future self, when faced with the terrible incentives, will not be able to do the right thing. But your current self already knows that, so you must take precautions for it, right? So if Ulysses has no one else to monitor and govern him the way he could monitor his men and pour wax in his ears, then it is upon Ulysses to tie himself to the mast. That's sort of the idea. So this legend or folklore was, you know, invoked by John Elster when he spoke about constitutional constraints. So that's where this comes from. So I had written a column that said that the Indian Supreme Court needs its own Ulysses Pact, which is they need to come up with a system of internal rules and protocols on appointment, on retirement age, and they need to stick by it, right? Now these are experts in lawmaking, right? So they need to create a culture where they come up with a very clear set of rules on appointment and they have disclosure requirements, right? So that's one way. Another is they need to have protocols for recusal, which is if you are adjudicating your own case or it's come before your bench, when must you recuse yourself and when can you continue, right? That's another kind of situation that needs protocols. Then a third situation that needs protocols is, should there be some kind of like moratorium or a gap before you're allowed to take other paid work or, you know, work for the government of India? You know, you also don't want them working for Adani immediately after they sat on a bench which has a judgment affecting the Adani companies or something like that. So we need to have rules and protocols for all this. And there are two parts to the rules and protocols. One is they need to be put down. And the second is we do need some leadership within the judiciary to actually enforce this over a period of a few years such that they become conventions, right? Because it's very difficult. I mean, we've tried the bazooka, which is the constitutional amendment, and it has failed. And the public was with the judiciary at that time. So the judiciary needs to save itself because if they won't let any sunlight from outside, they need to come up with a set of rules. So that is, I think the number one thing that is required. The second possibility is we burn the whole thing down and build it up from scratch, which could be done with a strong leader like Narendra Modi, frankly. You know, he has such huge public support and mandate that if he said that the Supreme Court is extremely corrupt, which it is, and there's too much nepotism and dynastic whatever in the Supreme Court, and we need to create a new system by which judges are appointed and promoted, it is wholly possible that he might get away with it, right? So once again, Narendra Modi will also need a Ulysses pact, like he should not go too crazy with the power and the mandate that he has."

        "message": "required. But the trouble, you know, we kind of need someone who's around for three, four years. I'll tell you why we need someone to put the rules in place and enforce them and create a culture over 50-60 judges journey. You know, that's when it really takes. So I think Justice Chandrachud is the next one in line, not immediately, but is the next one who will have a fairly long term. So my hope is that maybe, you know, his term is long enough. You know, this is your classic residual clemency problem, right? So initially when we used to talk about courts, we used to say the Kanya court, the Shastri court, right, the Bhagwati court. So the chief justice who was leading the court was sort of responsible for what happened during that time in terms of its jurisprudence and procedure. So we have no one to take ownership of the court because the churn is just so high. So I think one way of thinking about the incentive problem is like you said, you know, someone just like Justice Sikri on his last day of retirement just gives you the crazy nuclear judgment of Keshavanand Bharti and flies off into the sunset, right? The other possibility is someone says, I'm here for five years, my reputation depends on it, and I have a chance to really reform and put down some rules and actually enforce the rules and turn them into convention. So I think both are possible. The question is, what will happen and who will do it?"
