        "message": "How do we evaluate our precedents in prime ministers? Ideally, we should do so on the basis of their governance. But governance is complicated, the economy is complicated, policy is complicated, the state is a convoluted beast that moves in many directions at once, and disentangling all of these is hard. How much of what happened is down to the decisions of the person at the top. How many of those decisions were good or bad, regardless of the consequences? What are the counterfactuals? What are the counter-narratives? In most cases, we can't tell. So we instead judge our leaders based on our prior perceptions of them, the image we already have in our minds. We rationalize or condemn everything they do, regardless of what they actually do. Often, we judge them based on the ideological or political tribe we have already chosen. Sometimes, though, a leader is either so bad or so good that even those blinkers are irrelevant. I feel like that when I think of a man called P. V. Narasimha Rao. Born 101 years ago on June 28, 1921, Narasimha Rao happened to be the compromise candidate when he became the Prime Minister of India in June 1991. India was in the middle of an existential economic crisis. Bold action was needed to get us out of it. We needed to go against every political current that had brought India to where it was. Narasimha Rao was a man of great learning, but India needed a man of great action. He realized the gravity of the situation and used his political skills to bring about the famous reforms that lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. What he did for humanity is incalculable. And yet, his achievements are today minimized and even mocked by his own party. There's a haunting image of dogs nipping at his half-burned body on his funeral pyre after he died. And that's a perfect metaphor for what this country has done to one of its tallest leaders. If it was not for P. V. Narasimha Rao, I may not have been recording this today. And if you're Indian, you may not have been listening to it."

        "message": "Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Vinay Sitapati, a political scientist who's been on the show before to discuss the history of the BJP before Modi. That's one of the most popular episodes of the show. And I'll link it from the show notes. When Vinay got in touch recently and said he was visiting Mumbai, why don't we meet for coffee? I instantly took the chance to invite him back to my home studio to discuss his outstanding first book, Half Lion, How P. V. Narasimha Rao Transformed India. Vinay came over for a meal and a recording. And we had this conversation. Vinay's book began with the question of how central Narasimha Rao was to the 1991 reforms. Would they have happened anyway? His narrative reveals that without the man who put together the remarkable team that carried out the reforms, they may not have happened. His book also paints a fantastic picture of Narasimha Rao, the man. Here was a boy from humble background whose hunger for learning was second to none. He was a self-taught polymath who knew 13 languages, 10 of them spoken by humans and three computer languages that he taught himself when he discovered computers in his 60s. He was erudite, pragmatic, and when action was required, a man of action. Vinay's book brings out these aspects of his character and is also unflinching in looking at the things he got wrong. Vinay and I spoke about many other issues, and the first half is a freewheeling chat on politics, history, political science, why we want the things we want, and a road between Bandra Station and Bandra Reclamation that contains all of India within it. Before we get to the conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long-form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up-level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up-to-date with ideas, skills, and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future.

And I want to start off by sort of referring to an episode with you and indeed your book on the BJP really eye-opening for me. And I want to start off by asking you about something that we spoke about. And then subsequently, you know, there's been a counter narrative to that. Yeah, when Dhirendra Jha's book Gandhi's Assassins came out recently, there was a prominent blurb by Christophe Jaffrelot saying that, oh, to the effect of, I don't remember the exact words, but to the effect of this proves that the RSS was involved in Gandhi's murder. And when we spoke, you pointed out how, yeah, Godse was in the RSS in the 1930s. But then by the early 1940s, he had, I mean, he didn't formally resign, but he had nothing to do with them. And most importantly, in his magazine Agrani, for years before he assassinated Gandhiji, he railed against two targets, which were RSS and Gandhiji, which kind of, you know, proves that he would have had nothing to, you know, he was completely out of the RSS orbit. And this book using mostly circumstantial evidence claims seems to imply that, no, he was an active part of the RSS, which I didn't see any direct evidence for it was circumstantial. And also that the RSS is involved in the murder. So firstly, you know, what would your response to that be? And secondly, the broader question is, is that, you know, I abhor the RSS and obviously abhor Godse as well. And I don't think that one needs to associate them necessarily and force fit them together to be against them. So it's almost as if that this narrative is important for people to prove as they've been kind of talking about for the last, you know, since Gandhiji died."

        "message": "So what's your take on this? Well, let's stick to the facts for a minute before, you know, the larger narrative, right? It's a clear fact that Godse was a Hindu nationalist in that he believed in Hindutva. He was a fan of Savarkar. The criticisms that he had of Gandhi are the exact criticisms the RSS had of Gandhi. There's no disagreement on that. Even the RSS would say that, look, we may respect Gandhi, but these are the criticisms we had of him, etc, etc, appeasing Muslims, appeasing Muslim League, you know, appeasing Pakistan after creation of Pakistan, etc, etc. So both Godse and the RSS had the same views on Gandhi. The question and the question for criminal liability is, was the RSS involved in the murder of Mahatma Gandhi? There is no evidence for that, right? There's a little more circumstantial evidence that says, look, what's the role of Savarkar, right? But in the, and this is not a question that has not been asked. This is a question that has been asked heavily for the last 75 years. Immediately after Gandhi's murder, RSS was banned. The police, which was run by Patel, was not sympathetic to the RSS at all. And a year later, they found no evidence against the RSS, which is why they removed the ban on the RSS. Why would they remove the ban if the RSS was involved, right? The RSS was not charge-sheeted, people were arrested, but nobody in the RSS was convicted or punished for this. And for decades later, this question has been asked again and again and again, right? And as you point out, the new book is, you know, is circumstantial evidence and you have to then ask the question, why are we interested in that today? Because somehow you want to tarnish the BJP today with something that happened 75 years ago and on which so much research has already been done, right? And as you said, why can't you just criticize the BJP saying that, you know, and I do that in my book saying that, you know, it's treatment of Muslims is unconscionable, etc, etc, etc. Why do you have to invent these other things, right? The other thing that has constantly been, I would say, invented on the BJP is that it's fundamentally a Brahminical upper-caste organization. It's not. And if it has that in the beginning, it's certainly not the case under Modi and, you know, Amit, I keep wondering, why can't you just say the problem with the BJP is that it's majoritarian, that, you know, 200 million Indian citizens it seeks to exclude from citizenship. That's bad enough, right? Why do you have to, you know, and the problem with doing this and especially things like the relationship between RSS and Gandhi's murder, which, by the way, was a Congress political platform for decades after, which is, you know, vote mat de do Gandhi ke hatyaron ko. That used to be the voting rallying cry, but there's just no evidence for that. And I feel in some senses, you know, critics of the BJP do themselves disservice with these kind of allegations that have been exhaustively studied and exhaustively disproved over seven decades."

I loved his previous two books, which I recommend you read, called The Dark Knight and Ascetic Games. The Dark Knight, in fact, has a history of how the whole Babri Masjid controversy started. Akar Patel first told me about that book. So a wonderful journalist, not a knock on him. And this book also has some excellent journalism slash history and, you know, all of that. But it also seems that there is, you know, a need to kind of push a narrative about a party where absolutely everything is black. And if this has become a dominant narrative that the RSS killed Gandhi, then they've got to find a way to kind of talk about it, where I found, you know, my conversation with you enlightening on this that, you know, Godse railed against them for years in his magazine Agrani. And yes, you can't necessarily absolve Savarkar in the same way. But that's again, a whole different story. And as far as caste is concerned, you know, the fact is that both in 2014 and 2019, more Dalits voted for the BJP than they did for any other party."

And hopefully one day we get past it, though we are nowhere close to doing so. But that doesn't mean that Hindutva per se is necessarily casteist. What Hindutva is, especially as we see it today, is anti Muslim and, you know, and that is a big problem. And that's reason enough, I think, in my mind to sort of oppose it. You know, you've mentioned to me that you've never voted for the BJP and why and so on and so forth. And we've just kind of spoken about the anti Muslimness and all of that. But is it the case that after you came out with these two books on Narasimha Rao, which we'll discuss in some detail and which I really love reading, and your book on the BJP for Modi that people, especially within academia, within the world of history, began to look at you differently, as if in some way, you are an apologist of some sort, just because of the subject that you chose. I mean, a long time back, I remember I did an episode with Prashant Jha, who wrote the book How the BJP won, which is about 2014. And there is nothing, nothing in that book, which indicates ready supports of BJP. It's just data analysis and really sharp analysis and all of that. But I mentioned that book to a friend and said, you really must read this if you want to understand why they won in 2014. And he's like, nah, nah, he must be a BJP guy or whatever."

        "message": "Have you had to go through that? That's a very interesting question, you know, because for my first book, which is what we're going to discuss today in detail, the biography on Narasimha Rao, the hot button political question was economic liberalization, right? And of course, I asked the question, who did it? Who was the author of liberalization? And I argue that look, it was a political, not a technocratic process. And therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the politician in question, which is Narasimha Rao. But an underlying assumption was that liberalization was a good thing, right? That it worked, that it, you know, has brought about growth, that it has lifted enormous amounts of Indians out of poverty, that it has increased government revenue to the extent that it can fund welfare schemes like NREGA, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyano, even the food security package that India has in a way in which prior to 1991, Indian government simply didn't have the resources. And while it has increased inequality, which is a problem, Indian inequality by at least by Gini coefficient standards is not alarmingly high, it's a problem. But you know, poverty reduction, high GDP growth are spectacular, right? Now, when I wrote that, I was worried that I would get pushback from lots of people who felt that liberalization was a bad thing, right? I did not, right? And I was not tarred saying that, oh, you are a, you know, neoliberal, right? And I think, Amit, it's because in India, that battle has been won, you know, that in a deep way, whether it's Mayawati or Samajwadi Party or DMK, the broad agreement is that, you know, the state has to retreat from the market broadly, right? And instead, the state has to play an active role when it comes to welfare schemes and the two are connected, because when the state retreats from the market and allows for private enterprise, state taxation goes up, and it's able to use that increased revenue for welfare schemes, which then allows them to win votes, right? This is a broad social democratic contract that has now become common sense in India. And it has become common sense that look, if you want welfare schemes of the NREGA scale, you know, you better get high GDP growth. And if you want high GDP growth, the state better retreat from the market, right, roughly. So that has not happened, right? So the second book, on the other hand, Amit, I have got pushback, saying that, you know, are you an apologist for the BJP, right? And I find that a ridiculous argument that just because I'm saying that they're not fascist, they are, you know, driven by elections, they are focused on winning elections. And I'm arguing that if you want to beat them, beat them on the electoral battlefield, right? And I was thinking about Amit that, you know, I mean, I'm not invested in Hindu nationalism in that I'm not going to spend my entire career writing books on Hindu nationalism. But something that I did notice is that there's very little academic, genuine academic debate on Hindu nationalism, you know, I mean, I did my PhD in Princeton, I just finished doing teaching a semester at Princeton. So I'm quite familiar with global academia when it comes to India. And also, of course, Indian academia, when it comes to India, I teach at Ashoka University. And, you know, if you wanted a genuine debate on the BJP, genuinely, you'd be hard pressed to find an ideologically diverse panel, academic panel, right? That's a problem. Because academia works best when you have peer pushback and peer review, right? When you have groupthink in academia, it's deadly, because there's no other way in which academic truths are validated. It's not validated by the external world, by the number of books you sell by a third party. It's, you know, especially social science, humanities is inherently subjective. So what you hope keeps academic honest is peer review. And that just doesn't exist for Hindu nationalism, right? And the debates on Hindu nationalism are minor, you know, is it fascist or is it on the way to fascism? Right? And that's a problem. And I worry and I and you know, this book was in some sense, an attempt to counter that saying that, look, you know, it's dangerous when academics and intellectuals tend to have just one narrative, right? And if you notice, the right wing keeps pushing back against academia saying this. And I think that it has more than a kernel of truth, of course, to what extent they use the right wing uses this is very different, you know, and they use it often to stifle debate rather than to say, let's have better debate, right? But they are onto a kernel of something saying that, you know, you don't have ideological heterogeneity on a very, very hot button question in India. On the other hand, on economics, you do and I'm happy about that. You know, if you wanted to have a panel on is liberalization good or bad, even though there is broad political consensus that it's a good thing, you would have intellectual disagreement and I'm even though I literally load a book saying that liberalization is a good thing. I'm happy that there are academics who are constantly pointing to flaws in the way India did liberalization in 1991. And that makes for a healthy academic atmosphere."

So what do you do? And I had a great episode in the 91 reforms with Shruti Rajgopalan and Ajay Shah, which I linked from the show notes. And what you mentioned about poverty going down and inequality going up is a point I keep making, I mean, on the show and in columns that people confuse the two people often rage against inequality when actually is poverty that they mean, you know, a common question that I like to ask people on the subject is, in which of these two countries would you rather be poor, Bangladesh or the USA? And obviously, everybody would rather be poor in the USA. But the truth is, the USA has far more inequality than Bangladesh. And now that Bangladesh is having healthier economic growth than before, hopefully that's changing and it would be changing in the direction of poverty going down and inequality going up because everybody is getting richer, but the rich are getting richer at a faster rate than the poor. But what is important here is what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt calls a doctrine of sufficiency, that do you have enough to live an autonomous life with a certain amount of dignity? And if you have that, that's what matters. And therefore, when you are a nation that is as poor as India is, your first priority is always to kind of get rid of poverty. So before we kind of get to your book on Narasimha Rao, which is so illuminating and fascinating and so resonant, even in modern times, I'd like to know a little bit more about you. Now, typically, I do spend an hour, an hour and a half with my guests talking about the past life. So I had assumed that I must have done that with you the last time we spoke. But even though that was, I think, three hours, 40 minutes, we didn't spend that much time you did speak a lot on writing your writing process, which I loved and many of my writing students have loved. I keep quoting you, you know what you said about perfection being the enemy of production, which sinks in with what I believe about writing as well, that your priority should be to get it done and not to get it right. And often just getting it done again and again is the way to get it right. But we didn't speak about your childhood. And I just found out today that you are a Bombay boy, and you were kind of born and brought up here and all of that. So tell me a little bit about that, you know, what was, how did you grow up? What were your childhood years like?"

And it was a dislocating period for us, if I look back at it, because, you know, when you're in a public sector unit, and this is pre 1991, pre Narsimha Rao, you know, you have a car, you have a driver, you live in an apartment, there's a certain sense of stability, right? And then he, you know, he tried to make it on his own and, you know, big bad world of, you know, the private sector. And I saw, you know, that change of 91 taking place in my family, right? What did that mean was opportunity, but it was much more, you know, winner takes all, there was an element of insecurity, there was an element of risk. So I grew up with that. So in that sense, 91 shaped me. I spent much of my childhood in Bandra, right next to Leelavati Hospital, I don't know how many of your listeners know that. But it was quite a fascinating part of Bandra and Bombay that I grew up in, I still remember that I used to take this road from Bandra station, all the way back home to Bandra reclamation. And that one road told me much more about India than I learned, you know, at Princeton or anywhere else. You begin that road in Bandra station, which is a cosmopolitan place, people of all castes and communities and classes come there. And then you walk a little more and you know, you cross Lucky restaurant and as you enter, it's a Sunni Muslim part. So there are Indian Muslims, many of them are Sunni. And you know, you'll see butcher shops there, you know, these are lower middle class Muslims, you see many electronic stores, etc, etc. You just walk for a minute on the straight road and you'll see a Jain temple, right? And I'm just, you know, I used to turn back and I used to see meat shops and I used to look in front and I used to see this Jain temple, right? And then I used to see Jains basically crossing to go to the temple and they wouldn't look left or right because otherwise they'd see meat. And you know what, there was coexistence, there was coexistence, right? And in 1991, during the, sorry, just before that, during the riots, the 1992, the Babri Masjid riots, that road was not badly hit at all, right? Tells you that, you know, India has an ancient tradition of tolerance and coexistence. Anyway, you walk a little more on that road, you cross the Jain temple and it's a Marathi area. There's a Marathi school there. A little more and you enter into the Bandra Bazaar, which is heavily Catholic. And you know, these are middle class Catholics, but they have permanent structures, permanent buildings, right? And the thing that used to strike me is that unlike any other community, Hindu, Muslim, whatever caste, whatever region, the Catholic areas, the public space was clean, you know? And so it wasn't just that, you know, that the house was clean and the kachra would fall on the street. The street itself was clean, right? And it has always stayed with me that, you know, sometimes, you know, there are certain religious or intellectual traditions that make a public sphere more possible than others, right? And the way you treat strangers, you know, whether you're able to keep not just your house clean, but the road in front of you clean is not just randomly distributed, right? And anyway, the Catholic area would end and then there would be a Bangladeshi slum, which you would walk across. And then there would be a set of middle class Maharashtrian buildings where we lived and around reclamation and many of the labor for those middle class Maharashtrian buildings would come from the Bangladeshis, right, who lived in those slums. And it still struck me that the, you know, if I, again, you know, this is just anecdotal, I haven't done survey data, but most of the people who lived in those buildings would be sympathetic to the Shiv Sena, right? And they live cheek by jowl with the other, right? Bangladeshi Muslims who, you know, Baltakray would rail against. But there was coexistence. I mean, I must have walked thousands of times on that street up and down to Bandra station and reclamation and back. And I would, you know, at the time, I didn't like it, I was like, I wish I could take an auto or a car to go to the station. But on hindsight, I think that journey taught me more than a lot of books I've read."

Because, you know, I once in an episode with JP Narayan, episode 149, which I link from the show notes, was on one of my usual rants about, hey, India is so illiberal and look at communalism, look at caste, look at gender. And he said that if you look at it another way, if you look at the lived realities of people, there's also a deep liberalism here, because it is also so assimilative. You look at our food, you look at our clothes, you look at the street that you just described, right? It's in its lived reality, it can also be incredibly assimilative, and it would seem that the majority of people in the concrete live their lives that way. So what went wrong? Because one of the things that I felt while, you know, reading Akshay Mukul's book, which also we discussed when we last spoke, and I know you have some disagreements with it, was that there was always this intolerant, illiberal strain, this bigoted strain, so to say, running through Indian society, it was always there, it was not a political creation. And the politics that we see today is the supply side of the political marketplace responding to a demand that was already there, like I had an episode with Veer Sanghvi about his memoir, and in that he speaks about how Rajiv Gandhi's big win in 1984 was partly the Hindu vote turnout, because, you know, the anti-Sikh stuff and all of that. And that was what made the BJP in a sense, shift direction from, you know, their sort of the socialism that they came to propound in 1980, Gandhian socialism, back to integral humanism, back to back to integral humanism and quoting this Hindu vote. So it was supply responding to demand and then a race to the bottom from there. So what's your take from your road which goes from station to reclamation and where all of India lives? Yeah."

So if I would urge your readers to read the 2022 Pew survey on religions, which shows you that most Indians live segregated lives in that, you know, their best friends, their neighbors tend to be people who are from their religious group. But it's also a deeply tolerant life. So in India, segregation and tolerance go hand in hand and we will live among ourselves, we will marry amongst ourselves, but you too will achieve liberation through your sect or your religion and you have as much right to live here as I do, right. So in India, you know, it's really communities living cheek by jowl, they're not individuals living, it's not Western style cosmopolitanism, it is groups living, but groups living side by side and having some interactions like economic interactions, but not others. For example, eating food together or marrying together, right. The other way of saying this is that, you know, if you see this segregation as bigotry, you will say the bigotry goes hand in hand in tolerance, right. That has always been the nature of India that, you know, that it's not that this has always been spooked, there's been riots, you know, for a very long time, there's been Hindu Muslim conflict wasn't invented by the British, right, as Marxist historians like to say, it's an age-old issue, but that has gone hand in hand with Hindus and Muslims living together, right. And in the book, we'll talk about it, but in Narsimha Rao book around 1993, Narsimha Rao was Prime Minister and then he, Samuel Huntingdon has written this article called Clash of Civilizations, which then became a book Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order in Foreign Affairs and Narsimha Rao has friends in the US who send him the latest academic articles and he's reading it and in his archives, I found and if you see in my book, I have a photo of Narsimha Rao's version of Clash of Civilizations with his notes and the notes are very telling and these notes that Narsimha Rao writes on Clash of Civilizations was written just a few months after the end of Babri Masjid, right, December 6, 1992, just a few months after that. And also keep in mind that Narsimha Rao grew up in a part of India that had a very strong Muslim influence. It was Nizam's Hyderabad state. Many of his childhood friends were Muslims, right and he writes there in the margin that if Samuel Huntingdon is trying to explain why Islam is in conflict with other religions, why does he not explain the moments in which Islam is not in conflict? In other words, you have a theory there, Sam Huntingdon provides a theory for why there is a clash of civilizations from time immemorable between Islam and its neighbors, right and he provides a theory for that based on the nature of Islam. But then you should also have a theory for when Islam coexists with its neighbors as Narsimha Rao says happened through his childhood, right and then you should equally say what is it about Islam that allows you to live in coexistence with Islam, right and that definitely when I was reading that, I was remembering my own childhood and walking up and down this road for so long and this element of coexistence, but you know Amit, that experience of walking down that road taught me very early to be suspicious of a cosmopolitan individual right centric narrative of India. It just doesn't exist, right and given that I have some sense of where your economics is headed, I think some of India's economic tragedies can also be put down to the fact that we don't treat individuals with any dignity in this country. It's all about groups."

So my musing is this and I'm strictly thinking aloud based on what you just said that consider two scenarios and one scenario is that you live as we do where you have people living in groups segregated but tolerant and they're living in peace like in that lane you mentioned and as in India for you know, most of our history in most places and in the other scenario you have a cosmopolitan atomized existence individuals living in flats and apartments and all of that. My sense is that the first situation where you think in terms of groups is likely to break down at some point or the other simply because what you are really doing by living in groups is saying that this is my in group and those are the other and at one point you say I will be tolerant to the other but wherever you are hit by say extreme scarcity or all kind you know, there can be other triggers you can hit the other as well whereas if you're living an individual atomized existence that kind of hatred against a particular group of people is less likely. So in the second scenario where your cosmopolitan and individual rights matter, you'll have serial killers, perhaps those are the outliers, but in the first scenario, you could have a genocide at some point or the other. In fact, given a large enough sample size, it's inevitable."

If you want to have lunch or dinner with people only, you know, commensuality, right, that's the origin of jati, whatever, not origin, a key feature of jati, you eat, inter dining, you don't want to do inter dining, you want to eat only your kind of food, your particularities, you have every right. But there is this thing called public sphere, it means voting, it means employment, right? It means behavior of strangers in the street, right? In those things, you have to behave like an individual, right? So the best I think we can push for, right, is to say that there is this private life and private sphere. And if you want to be comfortable living a group life, go ahead. But insofar as we have these public spheres and public lives, please don't think about your caste, your religion, because you're all in it together. Because just the nature of the group is all 1.4 billion Indians, right? I would say that's a more achievable equilibrium than a Swiss society where everybody thinks as individuals in India, which, you know, I just don't see, at least in our lifetimes, that realistically happening, right? And one thing we've seen with, you know, the old modernization theory was that with industrialization, right, with the move from farm to factory, groups would kind of atomize and you'd move from rural group based societies to individual urban societies. You just haven't seen that, right? And in that sense, Indian modernization looks more and more like Japanese modernization, where you're able to both keep old traditions as well as reinvent new traditions of groups, rather than move towards what the United States or Europe looks like, though, even there, as we see now, group dynamics are playing a very big role."

        "message": "So you know, I used to go to school place to my 10th standard a school called Arya Vidya Mandir Bandra. That's where I spent seven to eight years of my life. And you know, the joke, we went when my Narasimha Rao book came back, the joke I used to say was, look, I went to a school where everybody knew Mahesh Bhatt's third or second wife, nobody had heard of Narasimha Rao. And I remember saying this at, you know, one particular event. And the person who spoke after me was Vikram Bhatt, you know, who is, again, if my memory serves Mahesh Bhatt's younger brother. And he, you know, he began by saying, you know what, I have to be honest with you. I didn't know who Narasimha Rao was, but I sure knew Mahesh Bhatt's second wife, you know. So that was the school I went to, right. It was a school in, you know, where it was an Arya Samaj school. So we had a disproportionate number of Hindus, mainly Sindhis and Punjabis, you know, ex-refugees or from ex-refugee families, who'd kind of made it, you know, in Khar, Bandra area, Santa Cruz, those areas. And we had a high proportion of Parsis because, you know, Arya Samaj worships fire. And you know, Parsis said, okay, we also are happy worshipping fire. So we had a disproportionate number of Parsis, right. And it was an interesting school because, you know, my parents came from a professional background. My mother taught at Bombay University, she taught sociology. And my dad was an IIT engineer, and he had his own consultancy, he had gone private. But you know, most of my students came from business backgrounds, right? Most of my fellow students. So for example, around Bandra station, again, those of you are familiar with Bandra, you have a series of jewellery shops, you know, where Hill Road meets Bandra station. Lots of my classmates, you know, were scions of those jewellery shops, you know. So it was a radically different world from those who come from a professional background, you know, and it gave me a very, an instinct that look, I like to read books, but I'm very familiar with the fact that other people don't read books, you know, and I like that diversity, you know, that I don't want to only seek out people like me who, you know, who like books and who, you know, who quote and, you know, like whatever, you know, the life of the mind. Many people are not like that and all power to them, right? And you know, what does it look like to grow up to inherit your father's jewellery business, you know? What does it look like to grow up to inherit your father's Skoda business, Skoda car dealership in Sakinaka? So I had a pretty strong instinct for that, you know, and in that sense, I'm pretty happy I didn't go to Delhi and, you know, a certain world in Delhi where, you know, I'd only be hanging out with people like me. I think this has given me a good instinct for people who are different. Of course, you know, the class background was not heterogeneous, you know, people were broadly wealthy and certainly most people were wealthier than my parents were. But it, you know, it was certainly an interesting Khar, Bandra, you know, background, you know, for example, the school, we used to go swimming as a school every week to Khar gym, right? And I used to joke that Khar gym is the only place in the world where in the bar Sindhi is the lingua franca, right? That's, you know, Sindhi is the language that is spoken. So it's a very different kind of deal. And then after my 11th and 12th, I think my parents thought I was getting out of hand. And I went to Rishi Valley school, which is a Jindu Krishnamoorthi school. I mean, the stereotype of the school is, you know, you sit in on classes under a tree. And I think that that stereotype says a lot about the school, two of the happiest years of my life. I'm very happy that I didn't go there throughout, because if I'd gone there throughout, I wouldn't know how to cross a road with traffic, you know, because it's a it's a rural school, you live, you know, in a, you know, in a pretty sort of, you know, inside baseball community. And then I went to National Law School, Bangalore for five years. So I, you know, I studied law. And after that, you know, I found a lot of my students, a lot of my fellow students in National Law School Bangalore were going to these fancy American universities, for what we call an LLM or a master's in law, and places like Harvard, Yale, which was be out of reach if I was even going to IIT. And I just I applied because I thought it would be a good sixth year. So I went to Harvard Law School, I spent one year and I think at that time, I had an epiphany a myth, which is that if after going to Harvard Law School, I can't do what I love, then who can do what they love, right? And suddenly, all that pressure, everything mounted, right? But who am I kidding, right? If you know, after Harvard Law School, if I do something conventionally foolish, people think I'm eccentric, not crazy. And there's a world of a difference between both those those words, right? Eccentric people are, you know, people with options who choose to do funny things. Crazy people are just crazy, right? And I asked myself a simple question saying, what do I like doing on weekends, right? And I liked, you know, I used to follow Indian politics, I written a couple of peaches pieces for Times of India and Hindu and just crafting writing and crafting the narrative on politics is something that I found fun. And I said, Look, this is what I clearly like doing when nobody's forcing me to do anything else. Let's see if I can make a career out of that. And at that stage, I was quite keen to do a PhD in political science, I thought I would get into Harvard, I didn't eventually, but I decided to take a bit of a break because I didn't want to go degree from degree. So I came back to India and work for some years with Indian Express, again, fascinating time in Delhi, I was on the editorial pages. So I was a sub editor, doing you know, cleaning copy, but I was also writing edits, and I will occasionally do reporting pieces. And that's when my I would say my love for journalists, right? And you know, people who really are in the trenches, especially reporters, because the thing with reporters is that, you know, you may spend a full day, right? Seeing a story that only takes up 100 words, right? But other than the 100 words, that entire experience you've had is within you. And so when I used to meet older journalists, the euphemism, we use a senior journalist, I would find that them to be rich with anecdotes rich with experiences. I was also very lucky to meet Shekhar Gupta at that time, who has, you know, definitely become a bit of a mentor, he may not know it, but, you know, at least from my end, because I mean, many of your readers may see his cut the clutter, your viewers may see his cut the clutter. That's how he was to us that he would just walk to the journalist, and then he would narrate incident after incident. And that's when I learned the power of being able to talk about politics through a story, right? And an emphasis on contemporary history. So I think I owe him a lot. I also, you know, was very grateful to get to know Raj Kamal Jha, who's also a very well known author. But he brought a certain aesthetic and discipline to writing that I've learned a lot from. And you know, again, maybe I'm just ranting here Amit, but you know, my time in Delhi is a bit of Alice in Wonderland, right? And I completely agree with the criticism of Lutyens Delhi that there are a bunch of privileged, you know, ex ISO officers kids, right? That's a correct, I mean, like all stereotypes, of course, there are many people not like that. But that stereotype, the Arnab stereotype has a kernel of truth to it, right? And amidst that people like Shekhar Gupta and Raj Kamal Jha who are genuinely talented, right? It's very rare to find and when I found them, I was like, I used to stick to them, right? And that's the one thing I learned that it's important to pick your mentors, right? And Raj just the aesthetics of writing Raj told me never use the word I when you write because very powerful. So use it sparingly only when that I is going the word I is going to make a difference. I follow that in both my books, no I, right? This third person because you know what, I'm a boring person here, because you're asking me I'm telling you about the street, etc, etc. But quite honestly, I came here prepared to talk about Narsimha Rao, not myself. Because frankly, the subject is much more important than you are. And yeah, and after that, I spent six years in Princeton, doing a PhD in political science, I learned how to write a book, a book length project, I learned how to research. It was fascinating, but I was always very sure I wanted to come back to India. And I would have come back to frankly, Indian Express and journalism, at least that's what I told them. But luckily, you know, this Ashoka University was opening up. And now that I'm there, I don't want to be anywhere else. I mean, I get five months a year off to do my own research. It's an unbeatable proposition."

So I just finished reading this fascinating book that I'd recommend to all my listeners called Wanting by Luke Burgess. Abhijit Bhaduri had recommended it to me in the episode we did together and I picked it up subsequently. And it's a superb book. And the central thesis of the book is that most of what we want is not some inner desire. It is imitative. It is mimetic, in a sense, we look at what the people around us want. And in a sense, we adopt their desires to become our desires. Burgess's sort of realization was based on like this line of thinking about wanting and desire came from a philosopher called Rene Girard. And Rene Girard, I think a few decades ago, was asked to teach a class on literature. And he wasn't a literature guy, but he agreed to teach the class because he needed the money. And then as he read all these books, he found in them a thread that had not that he that, you know, other people who taught literature hadn't spoken about, which was basically that in all these novels and books and all that he read, all the characters seem to want something not intrinsically, but because some someone around them wanted it or they were expected to want it, and so on and so forth. And that's where the great tragedies took place. And the concept I was left with from Burgess's book was one about reflecting why we want what we want, and two about the distinction between thick desires and thin desires, right? And thin desires being sort of relatively superficial desires, which may be really intense, but which are which you've still picked up from somewhere else, and they're not intrinsic to you that, oh, I want a Mercedes C class, or I want this or I want that I want to go on a holiday there, and so on and so forth. And you think you want that, but you probably want that because of a bunch of other factors. And intrinsically, you don't really want that and thick desires, on the other hand, would be what you intrinsically want. That's who you really are. And I found this a very good frame to just examine my own life and my own choices and think about the things that I wanted, and why did I want that, like I was reading this book sort of on vacation, this is a bit of a digression, but there is a sport called match poker, not quite like poker, but something like it. And I won the national championship there with my team a couple of times, I was part of Team India, we went and we won the Asian championship. And then recently, last month, we went to the World Championship, where all the teams that we had thrashed in the Asian championship finished ahead of us. It was pretty devastating for various reasons, like regular team members had visas rejected and all kinds of shit happened. And I was while reading this book thinking about okay, why was I so upset? And that you know, the reason like the first reason I got drawn to that particular form of poker as it were, is because it was so different from poker that you had to work it out from first principles and there was an intellectual challenge. So the intellectual challenge drew me in. But most of the devastation that I felt was because I wanted the glory of winning a World Championship with Team India, even though I've already won an Asian championship with them, right? And why did I want that? Is it something so intrinsic? You know, it's part of most of our desire for validation is completely unnecessary and"

And you know, even when you did law, perhaps you go down certain paths, because they are great parts. Everybody wants them. Howard Law School, like who would turn that down. But luckily, you said you had that epiphany. And I'm presuming that what happened next, that process of seeking truth by doing the reporter's job by engaging with the world and everything that you've been doing. That's a thick desire. So if you sort of reflect on this journey of yours, you know, but does any of this make sense? Were there thin desires before you found?"

Of course, the problem with thin desires is you realize them too late, right? That you think they are thick desires, right? You think that there's something intrinsic and later you said, no, this is not what I really wanted, or I was I was influenced. So you know, so I definitely see that. But I think that at Howard Law School was an epiphany in that it told me that I didn't have to play the thin desire game, you know, that, you know, I should ask myself, what's the thick desire? And to me, the thick desire is what you do on weekends, you know, and is there a way to monetize that? I mean, look, I'm not crazy. I mean, you know, I, you know, I have to make my own way in the world and I have to, you know, pay for myself. So, you know, what can I do, which is, which links my thick desire, what I like to do on Saturday, Sunday, into, you know, being able to provide a, you know, a good livelihood for myself and my family, right? That you know, but so I think that gave me the epiphany until then, I definitely back of the mind, I have this thing that, you know, I have to, you know, I have to succeed in the way society defines success. And after studying in National Law School, Bangalore and Howard Law School, that way was actually pretty simple, which was to get a corporate law job and work on Wall Street. There was actually various and I did interview for some of them. But I had a second epiphany while at Harvard Law School, I took this course called it was I think Introduction to Corporate Law, or 101 Corporate Law by this professor called Guhan Subramaniam, who was a joint appointment between Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. And he was superb. He was absolutely brilliant. And I worked my ass off and I still got I think a B or a B plus. And I think that was another epiphany because it told me that corporate law was not meant for me that, you know, if I have the best teacher in the world, and I work really hard, I'm still not good at it. So why should I waste a career doing that? You know, I think that and by the way, I, you know, a lot of my students who I teach and who I give a B or a B minus, I tell this story to saying that, look, it's a signal, it means that if you didn't work hard, it's a signal to work hard. If you worked hard, it means that perhaps this kind of course is not meant for you. And that's a good thing, because there are a million courses out there, the million things you can do, right. So actually knowing what you're not good at is a good thing. So yeah, so I think that but thanks for clarifying that Amit, you put it better than I could."

He was, quote, within quotes, disappointed, but not shocked. His inner self remained unaffected, stop quote. And later you talk about how he became and how, you know, there was a pull to academics. And he had once said that had he not been a politician, he would have been an academic in Oxford or Cambridge. At another point, you write about choosing politics, where you write, quote, his choice of a career in politics was not an affirmation, merely the preclusion of other alternatives. In other words, he was a hopeless midfield, but a mundane existence would have driven him mad, stop quote, which is again resonant. And so you look at Rao's life, and he's a product of circumstance and serendipity in so many ways, rising in power as a compromise candidate, because he hadn't chosen a tribe, for example, you know, whether it's his becoming chief minister or later prime minister and all of that. But at a deeper level on the subject of wanting, it kind of made me think that there is an inner mystery there. And perhaps what he wanted was the life of scholarship, of reading and writing. And of course, he did write that semi autobiographical novel. And you know, he was trying to write it in the 70s. But politics called him back when, you know, Indira Gandhi got him to Delhi as a general secretary. So, you know, and one thing that is fairly obvious and almost a banal observation as we are, of course, all creatures of circumstance, you know, whether it's a circumstance of the genes we happen to have all the things that happened to us, that's right. But in terms of wanting is our wanting what we want also, perhaps, a matter of circumstance like the other thing that you point out with Narsimha Rao was that he did want political power that he did in a way, pull strings and maneuver and try to, you know, lie and bribe all of that, you know, to become prime minister when he did to become president in 82 when, you know, Zia-ul-Singh was chosen instead, and again later when Venkatraman was chosen instead. So he did want that power, even though he was, in a sense, an accidental politician. So just I think one way of looking at lives and reading lives is also as a web of desires and trying to figure out where they come from and what they do to you. And I'm just thinking aloud, this is a bit of a ramble, but what are your thoughts?"

        "message": "No, I think that's, you know, that's quite illuminating. I hope, by the way, you didn't structure just to say that my musings are equivalent to Narsimha Rao's musings as he grows up, you know, because I certainly haven't thought of it that way. The way I thought of Narsimha Rao is as follows, you know, I mean, an uncle of mine who has had a huge influence on my life has always tells me this, which is that God gives you a certain set of cards, right? Some of them are aces, some of them are not. The question is how well you play those cards and as a poker player that, you know, must resonate with you, right? I think Narsimha Rao had a very early epiphany that he can't control the cards dealt to him, right? He's married at the age of 10. He's married at the age of 10, right? You know, his family around him is illiterate, semi-literate. The family around him is semi-illiterate, right? What he can control is what he can do with those cards, right? So yes, the family around him is semi-literate, but he's a precocious student. He loves learning. So his father sees that and sends him to a school in a different village, even if it means that Narsimha Rao is cut off from the rest of his family, right? And by the way, this is a learning that is hugely helpful to him when he becomes prime minister. You know, look at the cards that are dealt to him, right? One is India is facing the biggest economic crisis, you know, it has ever faced arguably, right? The Berlin Wall has collapsed, so India's best friend in the global stage, Soviet Union is kind of withdrawing, right? India has secession issues in Assam, Kashmir and Punjab. In fact, I think in Kashmir and Punjab, if my memory serves, elections couldn't even be held when Narsimha Rao became prime minister, right? And his Congress predecessor has been murdered by the LTT, that's Rajiv Gandhi. These are the cards that he's been dealt with, right? And look at the other set of cards dealt with him, right? He is not popular in his own party, his party is not a majority in Parliament, right? He lacks individual charisma, God has not given him charisma, and he has to in some sense report to Sonia Gandhi. These are the cards dealt to him, right? The question is, how do you play it? And the argument of the book is he played it better than anyone could have played it in those five years, right? So I think that realization he has from a very early age that there are tons and tons of things outside his control. And he's not, you know, he's not going to die on that hill. He's not going to complain, God, why did you do this to me? He's not going to do that. Given the situation, he's going to make the best of the cards that have been given to him. And I think that's an early childhood realization that Narsimha Rao inherits. And I would argue that that's his core skill set, to know when to lose, to know when to win and to know when to cheat, you know."

Because, you know, in poker, what happens is that, you know, that even though it's a game of skill, luck plays a huge part. The quantum of luck is much more than in other sports, you know, I play 100 points of tennis with Nadal, I will lose all 100. But if, you know, you take the best poker player in the world, and he plays a newcomer who just knows the rules, it's going to be more like 52-48. So what you need for skill to express itself is volume. So you don't play one hand, you play hundreds and thousands and really a decent sample size in poker would perhaps be 100,000 or more."

And then even later, like, I completely agree with, you know, what he achieved during his five years, like you mentioned in the book that quote, in terms of the quantum of transformation brought about, Rao ranks with other 20th century revolutionary figures such as Nehru, Deng Xiaoping, FDR, Reagan, Thatcher, and Charles de Gaulle. But the difference you point out is that none of them faced all of these obstacles, which you just outlined, and he alone faced them and he made the most of the cards. And another way of looking at that is that, you know, when he was Home Minister, when the Sikh riots happened, you outlined it in your book in detail, that it's fashionable now to blame him and say he was a Home Minister, the riots happened. But as you say, what really happened was that he was given a message at a point in time that now all reports of this and the control of the police will be with the PM or with the Prime Minister's office. And those are the cards he's dealt."

And that even though he was Home Minister and in Delhi, the Delhi police report to the Home Minister, he was told on the day that Indira Gandhi died, that there would be riots the next day and police will report directly to the PMO. So he was held a bad, he was dealt a bad set of cards. If he had protested, he would have had to resign and his career would have been over in the Congress. But he could have done that, right?

There are things you can condemn him for and there are things you have to praise him for. We'll come back to Narsimha Rao later. But in that personal journey, there were other strands I wanted to pick up on and one was, you spoke about gaining a particular aesthetic and an approach from Raj Kamal Jha, who, by the way, also contains multitudes because I absolutely hated his first book, The Blue Bedspread. I thought it was purple, ornate prose and, you know, maybe the mimetic desire to write like Arundhati Roy, who was, you know, who wrote similar ornate purple prose, except that he seemed almost a parody, but obviously a great journalist and editor from everything that I've heard. I've never met him. So tell me a little bit about the influence he had on you, like the bit about the I I completely get in journalism, there has to be no I. I focus a lot on getting my guests to use the I because that personal journey is really for me what brings the show alive. And what makes each of my guests more than an expert on a subject, but an actual human being on a journey. So I aim for the personal, but in the journalistic context, you know, I can, you know, I totally agree with Raj there. But tell me a little bit about, you know, figuring out in terms of aesthetic, in terms of approach, in terms of ethic, how he influenced you and how you changed?"

That's what happens. And I look academia's full of this stuff, right? Because you need to be sort of self reflective or self self reflexive. It just becomes like a, you know, sort of an ego massage, that actually, you should be writing about tribals in Jharkhand. But, you know, you're talking about your caste privilege, class privilege, gender privilege, but actually that, you know, there's a way in which that becomes talking about yourself, I don't want to know about you, I want to know about the tribals in Jharkhand, right? So he, so I think he really pushed me into, you know, take realize that the subject that what you're seeing what you're reporting is much more important than you are, of course, you have bias and be a little aware of it, but don't be so aware of it, that that becomes a center of the story rather than what you are seeing, you know, I think the second thing that Raj has instilled in me, you know, look, you know, he won't consciously call himself a mentor. But you know, I would say that it's a one way I've learned a lot from him, is that the art of telling a story, you know, that what it means to tell a story, what it means to talk about the interiority of people, right, to give you one example, in the BJP book, which is what we talked about in the last episode, the book, you know, consciously ends with Modi's ascension on the national stage. And it's about, you know, Vajpayee and Advani's life and through them, we get to know Hindu nationalism before Modi. But Raj, you know, when I was talking to him while researching the book had a very interesting point he said, look, everybody reading the book will be reading the book backwards in the sense they will be reading the book knowing that Modi is in power today, that Hindu nationalism is hegemonic today. And knowing this, they are looking at the at the past. So you can't like go ahead and write the story of the past pretending that there's no Modi, right? So it has to lead up to Modi, it shouldn't be about Modi, it has to lead up to Modi, but it should be well aware and sensitive to the fact that the story only makes sense for people reading today, given that they're obsessed about Modi, they're obsessed about Hindu nationalism, right? And he gave me this example of this book that he had liked a lot, which is by Lawrence Wright. I think it's called the Looming Tower, right?"

So that isn't that right? That's right. That's right. But everybody reading it is reading the story of Al-Qaeda given 9-11. So how do you, you know, and it's a bit of a balancing act, because, you know, everything that Osama does, you know, in the 1990s, shouldn't be, you know, saying that, ah, this is what he did. And therefore, this helps 9-11 make sense, because that's a bit too reductionist. On the other hand, that's what the reader cares about. So how do you make that balancing act, right? And his answer to that, by the way, Raj's answer, and I really appreciate that, is often more aesthetic than it is analytical. So it's a treatment of a story, rather than the facts or the narration of the story, right? I've learned a lot from him about that. The third thing I've learned, which is, I think, the most important thing is that, you know, I mean, Indian Express under him, he's now the editor in chief, makes a conscious effort to not be left wing or right wing, right? Because it feels that the complex story is actually in the middle. So it's, you know, it's very critical of Modi, Indian Express houses Pratap Bhanu Mehta, who's I would say, the arguably the most famous Modi critic in India. And it has gotten him into enormous trouble, not least in my own university, which is shameful. But it's certainly not right wing. It's not a left wing paper, either, it gives plenty of space to Ram Madhav, you know, it's quite critical of cancel culture, etc, etc. And even when it comes to Modi, it's critical of Modi, it also says that there's, you know, tons of things that Modi does right, like the welfare schemes, for example. And it, you know, and, and I think that has to do in part with Raj's aesthetic of focusing on the middle, and on the complexities in the middle, right, and I've certainly for both my books, have taken some of that aesthetic, which is that look, it's a really boring question to say, I want to write a book, which says that Modi is the son of God, right? Or I want to write a book saying Modi is the son of Hitler, I mean, those are terrible books to read, right? The complexity of the story is somewhere in between and being able to tell that story, right? And being able to draw people from the left and the right to engage with you, regardless of their ideological beliefs by saying that, look, I have my own sensibility, right? But the facts that I'm telling you, and the story that I'm telling you is honestly done, and adds value to you, even if you don't agree with my ideological position. And I think, you know, looking back, some of that comes from both, you know, what Raj is doing with Indian Express, and frankly, what Shekhar Gupta is doing with the print, right? Which is it infuriates people on the left, it infuriates people on the right. But it tries its best to do what you said, which is to resist categorization."

And in fact, like, one of the small tips I give my writing students in one of my webinars is about how when you're writing an op-ed or an opinion piece, you want to engage with the opposite argument and not a strawman, but the best version of the opposite argument. And what it does, and there's a tactical reason for this, what it does is that today, what has happened on social media is you have vocal minorities, consisting of tribes. And within these tribes, you have people raising their stature by attacking the people in other tribes by attacking people in their own tribes for not being pure enough, and never addressing arguments. And these are extremely vocal. So it seems like everybody is like this, but these are minorities. The vast silent majority of people realize that everything is complicated, and they are confused and they want to figure shit out. So if you go there with the attitude that everything is complicated, here's what I think and here's why. And here's why I think the other point of view is wrong.

And so sort of going back to the second of the three learnings that you said you had from Raj Kamal Jain, one of them was that people who read your book, which is about the BJP before Modi, will read it knowing the ending. And therefore, in some way, the narrative has to play to that play to the ending. And I'm not sure I'm and again, I'm just thinking aloud, and no doubt you've thought this through more. I'm not sure that that's always the best approach to take in the sense that if you think about the world in probabilistic ways, there can be many outcomes today from where we are, it seems that Modi was inevitable. But in 1980, or in 1988, or in 1992, when Modi wasn't necessarily inevitable at any of those points in time, like if you think of the world in probabilistic way, like how I explain it is that, imagine you're flipping a coin, and there's a 50% probability. And as you flip it, there are two parallel universes which form and in one universe, its heads in the other universe's tails, and so on down the line for infinite parallel universes of which we occupy only one. And with the benefit of hindsight, we behave that whatever happened was inevitable, but actually, it wasn't, you know, and I wonder if thinking of what has happened as inevitable can lead you to the trap of sort of then framing history in a way that it leads to this and exactly this, like, for example, Keshava Guha has made the point earlier and that, you know, if Pramod Mahajan hadn't died, for example, you know, within the BJP, or if within the Congress, people like Madhavraj Shindia and Jitendra Prasad and Rajesh Palit hadn't died, maybe politics would be completely different today. Maybe Mahajan would be PM and maybe there'd be a real opposition in the Congress instead of what we have now. So all of those possibilities are open.

In fact, both my books on Narsimha Rao and on the BJP, the central point of both books is that these were contingent affairs, that these were demand side, they were the journey shaped the destination that we have to know the 100 years of the BJP to get to today, right? Because each of those years shape, you know, the way we came to today, right? And it wasn't inevitable. I focus a lot, you know, critics say a bit too much on personalities, right? But to me, personalities are important, because they are full of like what you the example you just gave by Keshav Goa on, you know, Pramod Mahajan dying or Madhavraj Shindia dying, what effect it has on the Congress. So I completely hear you on that. I think what Raj meant and what I took from him was not that the reader should first be told that the present today, this is the only journey that could have happened. It is that that's there in the back of their mind while they are reading your book. So you have to address it, right? Again, I haven't read Looming Tower, but my impression is that Lawrence Wright is not arguing that it was inevitable that the towers would fall. It is that the reader reading me about the various contingent events that leading up to the fall of the Twin Towers is having both the towers in the back of her mind or back of his mind. And I have to be respectful of that. I can't pretend that that didn't happen because that's what the readers and the viewers and listeners are seeing. That's what I've taken, you know, I've kept in mind like for the Narsimha Rao book, you know, a very important fact that, you know, I didn't want to hide away from was that Narsimha Rao has been shamefully treated today, right? That's the reality of today that he's been erased.

Look on Gandhi, lots of people have written about, right? And what Ram has done is dived into the archives, focused on primary material, but I just wish he could have also, you know, told us what others have written about, about Gandhi. Because look, there's a long tradition of that. That's also one reason why academic historians are hurt. Because they're like, look, this guy's writing on stuff that we have written about too. And of course, he has original material, original research, they're fantastic. But why doesn't he acknowledge us? And I think that, you know, that is a legitimate criticism.

And then Ram saw the Twitter fracas, and he wrote to me, and he said that, no, no, listen, don't defend me, just stay out of this. So it can get a little ugly. But just sort of speaking about those secondary sources, and just a question that occurs to me that at one level, of course, that you don't just want to go to the primary sources and see Gandhi's letters and Gandhi's writings and what others wrote on him at the time, but also how other historians have interpreted that and looked at that. But you know, there's a term George Soros coined in his book, The Alchemy of Finance called reflexivity. And his point was that the way people think of the world changes the world. So if you think the reality is x and reality is actually y, reality will actually start moving from y to x if enough people think that is the case. Does this have an effect on historical figures whose careers play out over a long period of time, that they pay attention to what others are writing about them, or that what others are writing about them can shape a public mood and then change the way they behave?

I'm not going to give you a flippant reply, which is that, you know, do writers about history help shape history through this causal pathway, namely that leaders and people of influence are being influenced by that history? It's a good question, you know, but just one pushback a little bit. I don't, I'm not a historian. So I call myself a political scientist, my PhD is in political science. I'm an associate professor of political science at Ashoka, where I have some similarity with historians is that I use archives, but I use interviews, historians don't use interviews, right? So I use a ton. So that's what I have in similarity with reporters. So to me, the two primary sources that I use our newspaper archives, documents, you know, private papers, etc. and as well as interviews, and frankly, the interviews are what I love the best, right? But the big difference I have with historians is that I'm interested in causation. Historians don't like to think of, you know, the world in that way. So for example, when it comes to the rise of the BJP, I'm interested in what helped the BJP rise, right? When it comes to Nassim Maraou, I'm interested in making the causal argument that Nassim Maraou caused liberalization, right, or certainly caused the success of liberalization. So I'm making a causal claim. And thirdly, unlike historians, most of the secondary sources I refer to tend to be political scientists, right? So certainly, so I would call myself a political scientist who uses historical methods, as well as journalistic methods, right? But again, maybe it's the Harvard Law School syndrome, Amit, I don't feel insecure as having to prove that I'm one amongst them. I mean, whatever, man, I'm like a tenured professor in a university, right? I teach students, you know, I just spent a semester teaching at Princeton. So you know, I don't have that insecurity at that level. And B, and at a deeper level, Amit, having spent lots of time with academics, I don't think academics are any smarter than non-academics, right? Just like it's like saying, are doctors smarter than non-doctors? No, it's just that doctors have gone through a certain training, and know some methods that non-doctors don't know, but their IQ may not be better than the patient, right? And so similarly, I have, I'm under no illusion that academics are, you know, the smartest people in the room. No, they're not. They just have done a PhD, most of them, and they have, you know, some kind of methodological training that gives them certain advantages and doesn't give them many other advantages. So this idea of having to write for academics, I don't think that they're the smartest people in the room. I mean, I'm not disrespecting academics. But I think that they're just, you know, as smart as bankers or as smart as journalists on average. There's no particular difference, right?"

But staying with academics for a while, like, in another context, the context of economics, Ajay Shah had once, you know, lamented on the show, that so many talented economists prefer to play that whole academic game, the circle jerk, as it were, and circle jerk is a word I'm using, Ajay is too polite to use such terms, but that whole academic circle jerk where they're writing for fellow academics and they're getting plaudits there and so on and so forth. It's a reflexive game and they're not really growing. And the incentives of that seem terrible to me because, you know, then you're sort of driven into directions to follow certain kinds of fashionable dogmas of the moment and so on and so forth. Yes. And Ajay's deeper point, which I think would resonate with you as well, given your book and Narsimha Rao, is that there are very few of these economists, therefore, who are choosing to stay back and engage with the real world. And one of the points and one of the themes he speaks about to give context to this is how there was actually a community of economists in the government at one point in time, economists and wonks and bureaucrats who believed in reform, who right from the 80s were doing the groundwork for reform so that when that moment came, you know, even before Narsimha Rao asked Manmohan Singh to be finance minister, Naresh Chandra, his cabinet secretary, had given him a paper outlining all the reforms that should happen because that community of wonks and bureaucrats had prepared it. And he says that that's dying out there, that it was vibrant through the 90s, it was vibrant in Vajpayee's time. He doesn't see that anymore in the younger generation who are playing the academic circle jerk game."

        "message": "No, I think there are two reasons for that, there are two reasons for that. The first reason is that, you know, the government is less receptive, right, let's be honest. In the 1980s, you had people like LK Jha, Abid Hussain, Manmohan Singh, Montek Singh Aluwalia, you know, Rakesh Mohan, you know, these are all fine intellects, right? Rakesh Mohan did his PhD in Princeton, Manmohan Singh, you know, you know, was at Oxford and Cambridge, Montek Singh Aluwalia, you know, was in the World Bank and you know, people like LK Jha, Abid Hussain were first rate intellects, right? And they were not just persuaded about the importance of liberalization, they knew how to work the system and these two are not the same thing, right? So that as you mentioned, when you had a determined Prime Minister or a talented Prime Minister like Narsimha Rao, you have a note available to him saying do X, right? And hire Y, which is hire Manmohan Singh, right? I worry that this government and now I'm straying away from my research into, you know, speculations on the present. I worry that this government under Narendra Modi has contempt for, you know, economists as intellectuals and that's a problem, right? Because in a country like India, a developing country, we don't have left-wing intellectuals, right-wing intellectuals, left-wing economists of high quality. We have what we have and we have to use those few resources for national development. You can't just say that everyone with a foreign degree and, you know, who speaks English should be junked. The RSS is not producing world-quality economists. So you should go to war with the army you have. And so I think that one reason for what you mentioned is that this government is less receptive. They're less receptive for people of the quality of Arvind Subramaniam, they're less receptive of people like Raghuram Rajan and that's a problem, right? But the second thing you said, which is that part of the reason is that academia itself is being so professionalized that you're not finding, A, people who work on real issues and B, people who are willing to engage with policy and government. I think, unfortunately, that's true too. I can't speak so much on economics only through friends who are, you know, who are economists. It's certainly true of political science, right? It's certainly true of the humanities. I can see that. And it is a larger tragedy. There's a third thing, and I think I should have mentioned this earlier when I was talking about my life history, which is that when I finished my PhD in Princeton, I was determined to come back to India. No matter what, I didn't want to look for a job in the US. And part of that was, Amit, it was a deep-seated feeling that the creation of knowledge has jurisdictional issues, right? Or to put it differently, if you're an economist whose aim is to get tenure in a US university, you won't focus, or it's much harder for you to focus on issues of economics in India. It's just much harder for you to look at, you know, what is happening in American economics. You'll try to find the analogy in India, right? For example, in political science, so many of my friends in the US are obsessed with, you know, Trump is the fascist, you know, Modi is India's Trump, right? Which is absolute rubbish. I think that's a third problem, which is we are seeing a brain drain of high quality scholars to the West. And the incentives to produce in the West are very different from the incentives to produce in India. And then I would say the main reason I came back to India was that I felt I would be stifled in the US. I would have to produce things that help me get tenure there. Even if it meant lying about India or exaggerating about India, or more likely focusing on topics that are not hot in India, right? And that's not something I wanted to do. And I think that's a third problem that, you know, explains what you're just saying, which is that we're seeing a brain drain. Now we have institutions like Ashoka, Kriya, and, you know, hopefully, state and central universities also revive some of them like IISc are excellent, right? We need to push that. And you know, when I met senior BJP leaders for this book, for the BJP book, my second book, they were constantly complaining saying, it's an anti-national institution. I'm like, do you want the anti-nationals to be in India or do you want them to be abroad? You know, don't you want them to be in India, because at least they're focusing on Indian issues, right? Don't you want to create, when you say make in India, don't you want institutions of higher learning also to be made in India? I think that matters hugely, you know, and you know, in an interview elsewhere, I've said that self knowledge is a sovereign asset. And I would say I believe that very strongly, right? I mean, Amit, if you are doing this podcast, you know, sitting in the US or the UK, right about India, but with half an American audience or half a UK audience, the questions you would ask me or the questions you would ask others, the kind of people you would pick would be"

And it is a presentation of the results of that, that there are facts about the past, you turn it into a story, you present it, and that's history. That's how normal people think of history. But within academia, that's not it. That's not the thing alone. Within academia, and academic history, there are prisms that you have to look through ideologies that you have to superimpose on history, you have to look at it in a particular way, anything that falls outside that prism, and is not useful to you, you have to cast it aside. And that pollutes the field. And that perhaps is one more reason why a lot of good history actually comes from people outside, you know, that academic line, like people like Niram Guha, and Manu Pillay, and so many great Western historians as well, in fact, who are castigated for being popular historians. So tell me a little bit about this, because, you know, many of my listeners would have heard phrases like Marxist historian, and so on and so forth, kind of give me a sense of what are the different schools of history? What are the approaches to history? And when a newcomer like you comes in, how do you make sense of all this and set that path for yourself?"

I'm not a historian, I don't teach courses in history. I have some amateur interest in history, especially ancient India. So I'm reading up quite a bit about it. I mean, you know, shout out to those who haven't read Upindar Singh's work, I just finished reading her ancient India culture of contradictions, I could not recommend it more. It has an ideological point of view. It's also very, very, very good, right? And it tells you that, you know, that the two things may go hand in hand that, you know, a historian has a perspective, but within the perspective, you can be good or bad, right? Or to give you the example of Rumila Thapar, who I broadly disagree with, not even broadly, I specifically disagree with, right? She's a Marxist historian, or I would say her guru, Didi Kosambi, who I would say is even more of a Marxist historian, absolutely brilliant man, both of them are very good. While I can't answer the question of different ways of thinking of history, because I'm not a trained historian, you know, I use historical sources. But I am a political scientist, I'm interested in power and politics. I would only push your listeners that don't reject someone because of ideology. I mean, you know, the, you know, to call Rumila Thapar a Marxist historian and should not be a conversation ender. It should be a spur for you to pick up her books, read it. And if you disagree with it, you disagree with it. So to give you just one example, she's written an absolutely brilliant book on Somnath, right? The many voices of Somnath, the many stories of Somnath, where her argument is that the destruction of Somnath in I think the 11th century by Mohammed of Ghazni, she doesn't dispute that it happened, right? But what she disputes it is that this narrative that it's a historical wound in Hindu civilization, she says was not the case until the 19th century when the British made it the case, right? And Hindus did not see it in quite this way. And most of the sources we have, which talk about the barbarity of Mohammed of Ghazni in destroying Somnath are Muslim sources and Persian sources, right, who had an incentive to exaggerate, to make Mohammed of Ghazni seem like the protector of the faith rather than somebody who wanted to make money and came to India to loot, right? Now I happen to disagree with the book, right? Because she's going somewhere with the argument, isn't just an argument and I disagree with it. But it's a very, very good book, right? And it's, you know, something that you mentioned earlier, whether you agree or disagree, let's see whether we can pick the best person who argues on either side. And certainly Romila is one of them, right? A critique of Romila Thapar, if people are interested, there's this writer in Swarajya magazine, which is a center-right magazine called Arvindan Neelkantan, who I quite admire, who's written like a detailed critique of various things Romila Thapar has done. And what I liked about him and I told him that is, you know, I think he comes from an RSS tradition and I told him that, look, you treat her with respect, right? You disagree with her and in the few sentences where he's a bit disrespectful, I told him, please don't write that, you know, because the power of an argument is that, you know, Romila Thapar is excellent, right? She's serious. I have no need to question her bona fides, right? But these are the ways in which her interpretation has made errors, right? And so for those who are non-academics, who are attacking historians, this is what I would, I'm not, I mean, I agree with many of the criticisms, as I said, I'm not in agreement with Romila Thapar's project at all, right? But she's very, very good, right? And to attack her, you have to treat her respectfully and be as good, right? There's this American show called The Wire. Some of your listeners may have heard about it. And there's this man there called Omar and Omar's famous line is that if you, you know, if you're trying to shoot the king, you better not miss, right? So if you're trying to go after someone like Romila Thapar or Didi Kosambi, these are great scholars, right? So make the effort to kind of rise to the occasion."

And also, and these two might even have the same answer, that because the term goes around a lot, Marxist historian, what does it really mean? What is the lens you're looking at? And I accept that you're not a historian, and you've clarified that you're a political scientist. But, you know, as someone who's read much more of this stuff than I have, certainly enough to have disagreements with Romila Thapar, I've read her a little bit, but I don't know enough to have disagreements. So but just expand a little bit on that."

But loosely put, I would say, you know, Irfan Habib, Romila Thapar, Didi Kosambi, Didi Kosambi is really the great scholar, you know. So if anyone, you know, as I said, you know, if you want to aim for the king, you best not miss, first aim for Didi Kosambi, you know. And you know, for those of you who don't want to read his work, there's an excellent talk that Pratap Bhanu Mehta, the political theorist, Pratap Bhanu Mehta gave on Didi Kosambi in a Didi Kosambi lecture, a named lecture on him on YouTube, right, which sort of, you know, lays out Didi Kosambi's view of history. And it gives you a good sense of what the Marxist lens as applied in India is, which is a different, slightly different from the European and American Marxists, right. So the Indian Marxists, you know, are a little different breed. One thing they all have in common is the emphasis on class, right, and material dialecticism as applied to class and class analysis, and a belief that the real struggle or the story of history is class struggle, everything else is an epiphenomena, right. So to take that to the specifics of Romila Thapa's book on Somnath, her argument is that the motivation of Mohammed of Ghazni was not religious, right, and the insult and the humiliation that the Hindus felt was not religious, right. And it was invented much later on by the British, right, who had their own kind of agenda. So that would be one very strong emphasis that other axes of motivation are considered to use Marxist phrases epiphenomena, right. The other, so I would say that is a very important element, that there are peasant struggles, that you are looking at different modes of production, and during these different modes of production, feudalism, capitalism, what is the underlying class struggle that is going on and that forms the basis of history, right. So for example, a lot of Marxist historians would see the failure of the national movement as not looking at class revolution and focusing on nationalism instead, right, and scholars like Bipin Chandra, Aditya Mukherjee, Mridula Mukherjee, who are again historians, but they are kind of, they are off the left, but they are Congress historians who are critiquing Marxism or Marxist historians by saying that actually the national movement was a class revolution, right. So that is sort of, you know, defeating the Marxist on their own terrain, right. So I would say that, you know, broadly put, that becomes the way of analysis. It is not the only school of Indian scholarship. So for example, two other scholars that I admire greatly on ancient India also happen to be my colleagues in Ashoka University, that is Upinder Singh, who we have mentioned and Nayanjot Lahiri, who has written really a classic on Ashoka. Another scholar who is not a Marxist, but who understood Marxist ways of writing is Airavadan Mahadevan, who was a former IAS officer who dedicated his life to decode the Indus Valley script. Again he was not a Marxist. So, by no means is the Indian tradition on studying ancient India, and this is my, you know, this is all I am focusing on, is a Marxist tradition, right, but you know, you have high quality scholars that come out of India who also happen to be Marxist, but not all of them are."

One is, of course, the use of data and numbers, right? But that's not the only thing. I mean, I would say in political science, the big difference is that our focus is on causality, causal mechanisms, causal influence. Why did something happen? Historians will say, look, you can't put a finger on it. There are multiple reasons for why it happened, right? Whereas I am interested, that's very much my training, you know, and as I said, historians, the main method they use is archives, right? They don't use survey data, for example, historians don't do that. They don't do interviews. No, I don't do survey data. But I do a ton of interviews, which is some, you know, or what we now fashionably call oral history. But that's what journalists have been doing for a very long time, right? So it's just, I mean, again, if you're, I'm answering this, presuming that at least 1% of your listenership are academics to make that distinction.

I was about to say history, but I'll just say to write the two sort of biographies that you've done, at least in the Narasimha Rao book to a certain extent, it's not exactly a biography biography, but it encompasses elements of that, that one when you're writing about events from a historical perspective, but that still that, you know, many of the characters are alive, and kicking and interested in how the world will view them or how the world will view events and all of that, there then comes a trap of how much do you rely on interviews? And how much do you rely on oral history from people who were participants and who will want to push one side of the story? Now, what you've done scrupulously in both books, is that wherever there are multiple versions of something, you've pointed out what those multiple versions sort of are, you know, but you know, how careful do you then have to be like, when you're covering a particular event, do you then tell yourself that if this is likely to be something that is contentious, I should get a larger sample size of people to speak to from different points of view? How do you how do you handle that?"

But reporters do it on an everyday basis, and they have found a solution, right? You have good reporters, you have bad reporters, any story you do, right, any story you do, a reporter will speak to various interested participants by definition, because the interested participants are also the sources, right? And then the question is the question you just asked, which is how do you balance the fact that the source has an interest in the story and is spinning something to do, right? And this is what the skill of a reporter is, which is you get the source to speak, but you're very, very cognizant that the reporter comes from, the source comes from a certain position. So one way to do it is to try to balance it, search for the other side, so that at least you have multiple voices there, right? Two is do a preliminary fact check for the source, is the source, you know, lying, you know, is the source reliable? Ultimately, look, this comes down to human judgment, right? Why is Bob Woodward, Bob, Bob Woodward, right? Same issues, all the people he interviews, having, you know, when he interviews Trump, Trump has an interest in Trump, right? Now, how do you, you know, so how do you balance it out? And so I found myself Amit, in answering this question, not relying on academia, I think for historical sources, like archives, and for secondary sources, and for research design, academia was excellent. My PhD training helped me, it didn't help me for interviews, I had to go back to my Indian Express days. I was actually a not a great reporter, I was an edit, you know, an editor, copy editor pretending to be a reporter, but I knew tons of high quality reporters, how do you do that? How do you answer the questions that you just asked me, right? And I think this is what it is that if you if you find it's a contentious issue, get multiple points of view, right, you know, but you shouldn't, you know, strive for balance when there is none, you know, you shouldn't say, you know, some, you know, x believe that, you know, the final solution happened, y believed it didn't happen. That's ridiculous. There are facts in the middle. So do your own research, right? And frankly, Amit, I found that doing my own research was hugely helpful when I interviewed people, right? So, for example, when I interviewed Manmohan Singh for the Narsimha Rao book, I had done enough research, you know, I read some of the things he had written, some of his reviews from the 70s, etc, etc, when I was asking him questions, and I could see that he was impressed. And that was important for me, because I was in my early 30s. And here I was, you know, interviewing an ex Prime Minister about economics, right and about liberalization, and I have to prepare, because that's when they take me seriously, right. But preparing also means that I can call out when somebody is saying something that is factually untrue. The third thing is what you said that when you have a very contentious issue, rely on multiple people when you have like a, like, for example, suppose, you know, what Manmohan Singh was wearing at a particular point of time or Narsimha Rao was wearing, or what was Narsimha Rao's health, I'm happy only relying on his doctor because it's relatively uncontentious. Now, this requires human judgment, there's just no way to run away from that, right. And at some level, I am asking the reader to trust me. But what I'm trying to do while asking the reader to trust me is also to be as transparent as I possibly can, in most cases, tell them the sources, right, give the page number if I'm using a book or an article so that they can read it themselves, right. And I realized, Amit, that, you know, all of this, which is the process by which you get interviews, the process by which you look at documents, is all about building trust with the reader, right. And readers know that immediately, I'm sure you, you know, you have the same experience with your podcast listeners, very quickly, they know whether you're lying to them or not, whether you're selling them something or not, right. And that changes who you are, you know, you're very careful in asking questions to your your own interviewees, because you know that the podcast listener is trusting you, right. And I was very conscious of that burden that you know, I was, you know, in some sense, I felt I was an agent of the reader. And you know, when I was interviewing Manmohan Singh or anybody or Nassim Rao's doctor or his cook, I was there on behalf of the reader, right. And as I said, a lot of this I learned from reporting rather than academia."

So the question is the following that you keep doing research, right, at some point, you have to say that, look, if I spend another one year doing research, it's only going to improve the book 5%. That's when you should stop. So when you're at 80% or 90% there, you should stop and start writing. And then use the research phase post starting the writing to actually do a little more focused research, right? I don't know whether that that makes sense, because too many people I know, especially those who do PhDs or writing books are like, you know, they're spending years and years and years. One more book I have to read, one more book I have to read, one more book I have to read. It's wrong, you know, so you should stop when you're even 70% and you should start writing and leave holes and then do a second round of research. On the larger question that you asked on, you know, structure, how do I go about the book? I am quite a structured guy, right? So for both the books, there was a historical fact element, Nassim Rao was born at a certain time, died at a certain time. So what I did was for both of them, I had done about a year of general soaking and poking, not focused research. Generally, should I do the book? What should it be about? Nassim Rao's book, of course, start to finish took a year, but I'm saying for the second book, right? Very early on in the process, I wrote a mock table of contents, right? Saying that it will be a 350 page book, there'll be an introduction, there'll be a conclusion and then the 30 page chapters and I think Ram told me that don't have chapters more than 20 to 25 pages gets too boring, right? So if you have a 250 page book, you know, you should have at least like 15 chapters, you know, so keep small short chapters. So very early on, I write a mock table of contents and in both books, I've realized that at the end, when I look back at the original table of contents, it was actually 50% there, right? So when I write a table of contents, right, then every book and archive I'm writing, I'm putting into one of the chapters and I also divide the chapters into sub chapters. So when I'm reading a book, secondary literature, which is meant for say my Nassim Rao book or the BJP book, I'm instinctively saying, ah, this is a nice paragraph, you know what, it should be in chapter 6, section 4. So I write the CH 6, section 4 and then I go back and I and in my word document, I say this is what you have to do, right? And of course, once you read what your table of contents is changes a little bit. So you know, one of my favorite phrases, it's a unfortunate phrases, you should be prepared to kill your babies. So if you have a great idea for a book early on, and you have a great theory for your book early on, while doing research, you know, that theory may be wrong, you should be honest enough to change your view. So don't be wedded to an original idea, right? You may have even spent a month doing research to realize actually, that's a total waste, right? So be honest enough and make the changes. So what happens is, then I tinker with the chapters, I change the headings, I increase the size, I move it up and down, I do that, but as I said, even at the end, 60% is what I began with, right? But it really helps in focused research, because every time I'm doing research, I'm telling myself, okay, I've talked to him, you know, let's say I'm talking to Nassim Rao's cook, as he's speaking, I'm saying, oh, man, that was a nice sentence. That is chapter six, section two, oh, man, that's a nice section. That was chapter one, you know, and then I, you know, as he's speaking, I write down, and then I immediately go and move it to that particular word document where it is, which means that when I'm about to write, right, a 25 page chapter, I have 40 pages of notes for those chapters broken up into sections, and each section says where that primary material is, right? So if that's, you know, everybody has their way of doing it, this is my way of doing it. The big con of this way of doing it, which is a structured way, is that I might very early get committed to an idea rather than inductively making your way through an idea, right? And so the one way to solve that is not to be too wedded to the original table of contents, but that's the con. So the but the pro of what I'm doing is you can finish things quickly, and wastage is less. So to put it differently, and tell me when I'm getting boring on this, because I can speak endlessly on this process, which is that when I was doing my PhD, I used to ask around to other people doing PhD, how much of that actually made it to your dissertation? Which is the same question asking that anybody writing a book, how much of the research you did made it to the actual book, actual pages, right? And I found that for PhD students, it was, you know, 30 to 40%. Can you believe it? 60% is wasted. 60% is you're going down rabbit holes that don't make it to the book. Now some of that is inevitable in a process where you're doing original work. But my argument is, can you make it from 30 to 40% to 60 to 70%? You've doubled your productivity, still, there will be 30% wastage. And that's what it means to do original work, but it's not going to be 60% wastage. Was that too detailed an answer?"

So they should kind of go and listen to that. And Joan Didion once said, I don't know what I think until I write it down. So the process of writing as you know, part of a process of thinking about something of, you know, improving your own understanding of the material is something that I totally get and what like fiction writers will often talk of an approach to structuring a novel as you know, they'll talk of the architect and the gardener. So the architect is someone who's making a map where this is the house, this is the land it occupies, these are all the rooms, you do all of that. And the gardener is just pottering around messing around with stuff. And there isn't a right or wrong, different approaches work for different people, it kind of depends on who you are. And I think in a sense, what you're saying is that you're more of an architect. And of course, within each room, within each unit, you are still doing gardening, you're still leaving that space open."

And you know, the answer I, and for even for the new books I'm thinking about, I'm always asking this question, Amit, which is why should someone who doesn't care one ounce about politics, who doesn't visit Bari Sons in Delhi, who doesn't listen to Seen and the Unseen, what should they get from this book, right? So is there something larger that Narsimha Rao's life could hold? But I didn't find an answer until I was midway. And the answer is one sentence was Narsimha Rao tells us, how do you bring about change without power? How do you first gather power and influence and then wield it because he didn't have a mandate, right? He had only constraints. So under tremendous constraints without power, how do you then bring about change? That's the central question, right? And the central answer was he did it, because he knew how to be a lion, a fox and a mouse, which we'll talk about. But you know, I had so many people outside of politics, policy, the world of Amit Verma, coming to me and telling me this book resonated with me, you know, startup founders would come and say, you know, people think that startup founders have all the power. I don't, I can't fire my design person, right? I want to come into the room and I think it's a lousy website, but I can't, I have to suck up to them. I have to like, you know, because there's a shortage of labor, right? I had, you know, a top bank, a country head of a top bank, MNC, telling me, you know what, this book totally resonated with me, because people think I'm the CEO or the MD of the of the India version of MNC. But I have two people in London breathing down my neck. And all my deputies in India are reporting to their lion counterparts in London, not me. So I have to first construct power, I don't have power given to me on a plate, I don't have a mandate given to me on a plate, I have to first construct that power, and then use it to bring about change in my bank, right? Which is frankly the Nassim Rao story, which is you don't, you know, it's so easy to say that if you have power and mandate, you should do ABCD to transform India. First, how do you get that power? How do you get that mandate? How do you make sure that you're operating within the constraints? Every person is dealt with a bunch of cards, right? Some of those cards are strong, some of them are weak. It varies from person to person, but how do you play with the cards that you're given?"

        "message": "Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. So first off, again, I'm addressing to the non-academics who are hearing this. Most people who do PhDs and want to be an academic don't do this for teaching, right? Nobody says I want to do a PhD because I want to teach kids. Nobody does that, right? Then you're a school teacher. If you're a university professor, the main focus is research. It's not teaching. And I was under this illusion too, that look, I've done my PhD, I want to write my books, I want to do research, but for a living, I have to do some teaching, because, you know, teaching is a revenue center, right? Research is a cost center. So I have to, in a university, learn to teach. So I reluctantly said, look, let me do some teaching and let me be half decent at it. But Ashoka kids make demands, right? They work hard, they expect you to work hard. And it has been transformative. I've grown to love teaching, right? My student evaluations are good. I don't think students like me very much. I think they respect me, right? I try to be a tough teacher. What I try when I teach is to tell students that, look, I'm not going to waste your time by massaging your ego. You know, your parents have paid good money to come here, Ashoka is an expensive education. And instead, I'm going to try to add value to this to you. So that at the end of this course, you said, okay, I, you know, paisa vasool toh hua hai. And what does that look like? It doesn't look like pandering, right? But I'm going to tell you a bunch of things. I'm also going to sort of focus on a ways to think about things. So I've grown to like it and I've grown to enjoy it hugely. I just spent a semester as a visiting associate professor at Princeton teaching Princeton undergrads on Indian politics. I like that too. It's a totally different cultural context. It has certainly helped my research in the sense that it has allowed me to ask questions and demand answers that non students will not have the guts to ask, you know, one of the beauties of being a 17 or 18 year old. And let me give you this example. When I was at Harvard Law School, I attended a talk where Amartya Sen was speaking. And after he finished during the question answers, some undergrad got up and said, Professor Sen, I don't think you understand the concept of supply and demand. And he went on, right? And you know what, when he finished, there was some giggling in the back of the audience. But you know, Amartya Sen didn't giggle and he answered the question, right? That's powerful. Because sometimes you ask foolish supply and demand questions. But sometimes 17, 18 year olds ask the nub of the questions, right? And I think in the in the New Testament, if my memory serves, there's a line from the Cornetian called to be a fool for the sake of Christ, right? Say foolish things, say stupid things, because out of those four, five, one will be a brilliant idea. And undergrads really exemplify that, you know, they will often ask, you know, something about the BJP or something about Narasimha Rao that is the correct question to ask. But everybody else is too afraid to ask it because it sounds simple, right? So undergrads really push you on that. So you know, the BJP book, for example, before I wrote it, I took a course called right wing politics in India, and right wing politics more generally, where I was looking at other political parties also like AKP in Turkey, Likud in Israel, Christian, Christian Democrats in Europe, who are also kind of center right parties to kind of nestle the BJP story. Very, very helpful, you know. So I have, you know, the teaching has been something that is not something that I imagined I would like, but I like it. And it gives me a lot of joy. And frankly, it helps my work. And there's a last thing, Amit, which is the researchers, right? And people of the mind like you. One of the things we suffer a lot is loneliness. Because you know, you know, who, you know, it's not in an odd way, thinking is not a group activity. It's a solitary, solitary pursuit. And if you're sitting in some library, or you're reading up, you know, when you're reading a book in preparing, preparing for this, it's a lonely activity, you know, now, if you want to put a spin on it, you call it solitude. So which is why for the world of research, the world of teaching is great. Because if you know, you're as a researcher, you're selfish, you know, self motivated. As a teacher, you have to give more than you take, right? And if a student, you know, shows you to be foolish, I actually enjoy it. It means that, you know, I've trained my student to be smarter than me, right? Also keeps you grounded. I remember that, you know, I had gone for an interview with Dr. Manmohan Singh soon after he stepped down as Prime Minister for the Nassim Mara book. And he was, you know, elegance personified, you know, he spoke to me, he sat on the same, you know, sofa that I did was reading, he saw me off, you know, he was in advanced years, he saw me off outside, you know, outside his house to the car. And then I went from there to Ashoka University, right? And as it was the first or second day of class, and as I was entering in the mess, there was a bunch of students, you know, in a circle, and they didn't know who I was. So I overheard them. And one of them says, you know, my teacher's name is Sitapati. And the other kid shouted, he should have been called Ram. And then all of them laughed, right? And it brought me down to earth immediately, right? And for all the criticisms you have of cocky 17, 18, 19 year olds, they have the ability to bring you to earth very quickly."

And I agreed with you that it's a crucial period of our history. But why Narsimha Rao itself? And what did you think at the first was a core question behind the book, because one of the core questions that you've articulated is understanding how Narsimha Rao achieved so much despite having so little power.

And in that sense, it was actually quite lucky because I didn't come in with baggage, I didn't come in with having to prove that I want to give Narsimha Rao his, you know, his space in the spotlight. I didn't have any of that. I'm not Telugu. You know, I have no particular interest in Narsimha Rao's like legacy, you know, in any personal sense. But as I told you right in the beginning of this conversation, you know, my own family's fortunes and lives have changed in the early 90s. And I intuitively knew that the early 90s was a period of change in India. And while I was doing my PhD at Princeton, I had even organized or co-organized a conference called the political consequences of economic growth, saying that when you have economic growth in the 90s jumpstart, what are the political consequences? And we had a panel there saying, what are the political predeterminants of economic growth? So what are the kind of politics you need for economic growth? So I was thinking a little bit at that time about, look, what were the political conditions? And Narsimha Rao, of course, was prime minister in the early 90s when liberalization happened. And then I read a book which transformed me, which was a book by Ezra Vogel, who's I think a Yale historian on Deng Xiaoping and it was called Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China. And it was a two biographies. It was a biography of China changing in the 80s. And it was a parallel biography of Deng Xiaoping who was instrumental in that change. And I finished reading that book and I said, you know, a book like this needs to be written about India and it's about India changing in the 90s and the Deng Xiaoping trigger was this man called Narsimha Rao, who I didn't know much about. But that's what piqued my interest because even then, and maybe as a political scientist, I was like, look, change in India doesn't happen because of a blueprint or because of ideas or because of a technocrat. There also needs to be a political will. How did that political story unfold? And so that pushed me to Narsimha Rao, I still didn't know much. And then I did some background research, I read up the secondary literature on the debates on foreign policy changing in the 90s, economic policy, welfare schemes, and I said, ah, it's not just that the first McDonald's came in the early 90s, a lot else changed in India. And then I was lucky enough, you know, by talking to people, one of them introduced me to Narsimha Rao's son, Prabhakar Rao, and I went all the way to Hyderabad to visit him. And as I was going to visit him, I just thought, you know, I was going to Hyderabad, hometown of Narsimha Rao, everybody would know who he is. And I got into this cab from the airport, and I was driving to Narsimha Rao's son's house for the first time, and I asked the cab driver, have you heard of Narsimha Rao? And the guy thought for a second and said, yeah, he's the guy on whom the flyover is named. And so nobody knew about him, even in his hometown, that was a catastrophe, right? And so I met Prabhakar Rao, and we got chatting, and then I met him a couple of times, I met somebody else, others in his family. And then he told me, look, Vinay, I've spoken to other members of my family, we've decided to trust you. Until then, he was still KG, come with me. And I went with him to his, in his office, I went to an attic of his office, where there were about 45 cartons, and he said, you can access it, right? If there's anything sensitive, I trust that you will run it through me. But otherwise, you can access it. And I told myself at that time itself, that I'm so lucky to have to deal with an air who's not like breathing down my neck, and not trying to, you know, censor everything I'm doing. And then as I began to access the papers, I was mind blown. I was like, this has never happened to any politician in India. You know, Narsimha Rao, we had government documents with file notings on the left. There were Narsimha Rao's private diaries, even his books in various languages, Marathi, Hindi, English, I opened it and I could see his notings, right? And so you had, you know, his letters, right? Narsimha Rao was a was a fan of computers. So on a dot matrix printer, he used to print out his diary, he used to write down his diary. So for example, when Rajiv Gandhi denies him a ticket in April 91, to contest the Lok Sabha elections, and so he's forced to retire. He writes that this is one of the saddest days of my life. So you have that level of intimacy, right? Or another noting, the day after Rajiv has been murdered by the LTT, and his body has been brought to 10 Janpath. And all the congressmen are hovering around the body pretending to cry, but actually maneuvering to see who will succeed him. And Narsimha Rao as he is there, Pranab Mukherjee sides by Narsimha Rao and said, look, you should be the heir, you should be the next person. And Narsimha Rao writes in his diary, I kept quiet saying it shouldn't be me, it should be N.D. Tiwari, knowing full well that N.D. Tiwari was unacceptable, because I knew the kind of person Pranab Mukherjee is, right? Think about it, right? He, you know, you're getting that level of detail. So you know, I'll be honest with you, Amit, the book success is primarily because I got, you know, I, you know, I got my hands on this incredible resource, which is the private archives of Narsimha Rao. I of course did about 100 interviews to supplement it, but it's really those private archives. You know, if I had blown this up, you know, it would have been unforgivable, because after being given this kind of access, you know, it would have been unforgivable had it been a bad book."

Like, for example, early on in your book, you write quote, living on the edge of five linguistic cultures, villagers here spoke Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, Kannada and even Samoria. And in this land of the Nizam, the language of power was Urdu, while the language of courtly life was Persian. Narsimha Rao would go on to speak 10 languages. These were the tongues he inherited at birth. And you know, he taught himself Tamil, as you mentioned at a later point in the book, because he went to some felicitation of his in Tamil Nadu and couldn't understand what was being said. So, you know, he learned three computer languages when he was in his 60s. You know, when Rajiv Gandhi was saying that, you know, we need to enter the computer age or such like, our older politicians can't do it and he called up his son and said, send me a computer."

This is, you know, to think that till the age of 26, his conception of India was not what our conception of India is. His conception of society was not what our conception kind of is. Most of the people around him was semi literate. You speak about at one point when he's growing up, his father realizes that this little boy of mine already knows more than the village teacher. So he has to be sent to another village where he is all alone at the age of seven, just for education. That's right. And in a sense, I can imagine that seven year old saying to himself, what you said to yourself when you got his papers that I can't waste this opportunity. And a seven year old must be thinking the same thing. So it's not as if you are figuring out thick desires and thin desires, or you know, what does a kid want? The kid has an opportunity. It is the only opportunity. He's got to get the job done, and that's kind of where he is. And as a person writing about history, I'm being very careful not to use the word historian, you will note. As a person telling stories about the past, do you make that mental effort of forgetting everything that we know now, and just putting yourself in the shoes of that little boy and tracing the journey that he is taking?"

So to give you one example, Nasma was a bright kid, right? And that's his all him. I mean, I don't want to sound rude here, but the rest of his family are no patch on him. And as I mentioned that it was a wealthy family, they were revenue intermediaries for the Nizam. But it was not an educated family, right? And part of that reason is structural, which you should know, which is that in Nizam's Hyderabad state, most of the officials and bureaucrats were Muslim. So for a Hindu, like Nasima Rao, the family, there was no particular government service at the end of education. So why, you know, why take to education, right? You need to know this, right? But you also need to know that he is a bright man. So there's both going together. So you have to have the internal world of Nasima Rao. He's a man who has a felicity for languages. But you should also know that he comes from a part of India, which is kind of, you know, northern Telangana, right, very, very close to the Maharashtra border, where within a few hours, you could find people who spoke Kannada, who spoke Odia, who spoke Marathi, and of course, who spoke Telugu, right? And that matters because when I went to his village Vangara, there were people there who knew a smattering of Kannada, who knew some Odia, who knew Marathi, so both matter, right? So as a biographer, I can't only look at the internal world of Nasima Rao, kind of the triumph of the will, here's this bright man beating the odds, because the odds are determined by the circumstance. And that is a larger theme that, you know, runs through this book, which is this tension between structure and agency. I got to focus on Nasima Rao, but I got to look at the cards handed to him. And the cards handed to him on language were actually a good set of cards, because he was in the geographic absolute center of India, very close to Nagpur, but still in Telangana, in what is today's Telangana, and so he had access to all these languages. But you know what, he played those cards very well. So I mentioned that between 77 and 1980, when the Moraji government is in power, the Congress is out of power. Nasima Rao is General Secretary in Delhi and has very little to do. So you know what, what he does, he goes to JNU and enrolls in a Spanish language class and learn Spanish, right? And he drives his own car, parks his car in Jawaharlal Nehru University and learn Spanish, right? Nobody else in his village does that. And that's a good example of how agency and structure both matter in understanding Nasima Rao. Does that make sense, Amit?"

He was now on his own, visiting his parents only once every five months, education would propel Rao from village to town to city, into politics and into power, it would make him Prime Minister of India. But it would also cut him off from clan and community. It would make him remote, squirreled away among ideas and words from which he could never be sent away. He would develop a distant relationship with his children, a beleaguered one with his eldest son Ranga, stop quote, and about his marriage, married at 10. And he resented that marriage.

And eventually history places him at this point in time, and he does what he has to do. Like, so when you read his papers, is, you know, that's one sense and am I correct in thinking that this seems essential to me, this para seems essential to me. Apart from that, what else do you sense about him? Like we have spoken of his sort of almost fatalistic tendency to accept the cards given to him and then do whatever is rational, whether it is in the wildness of not acting before the 84 riots, or whether it is in the enormous will that he did show in 91 when he took over with the country in a mess and acted to kind of resolve it.

The other half is that he's curious and action oriented. So he has a bit of Hamlet, which is what you just described, and he has a bit of Don Quixote, which is an actor, right? So you know, the sort of I think it was Dostoevsky, but I could be wrong, who said that the two great Western fictional figures is Hamlet and Don Quixote, one who thinks but doesn't act, and the other who acts without thinking and Narasimha Rao exemplified both. And I think that's important, because what you just described and the paragraph you just read, gives rise to an introvert who loves books, who's a theoretician. And that is a well known feature of Narasimha Rao, right? Even a negative feature, the joke about him is analysis until paralysis, that he used to pout without spouting, right? And that gives rise to kind of the stereotype of a distant intellectual, who is like Nero, you know, when the Rome is burning. And that's absolutely not true. That's half the story. The other half is he was curious. He was action oriented, you know, I spent some time talking about how he brings about agricultural reforms in his own village, how he makes modification to the cotton plant to push people from growing rice, you get less money from rice into growing cotton, he goes to Gujarat, he gets the cotton seed, how as Prime Minister of India, I give so many examples of how he's rolling his sleeves and is at the center of economic reforms. He's not just a theoretician in the background. His genius was that to pretend to be a theoretician, so that he did not get the blame for liberalization, right? But the heart of the book is to show you the other end of the or the reverse of the para that you quoted that here was an action oriented curious guy, who knew how to get the job done, right? And so the duality of Narsimha Rao, which is why the title of the book is Half Lion, is that he was half a thinker, but he was half a doer. And at his best, this synergy between an intellectual with deep analytical skills, and a man who understood every inch of the state and how to bring about transformation in India is a central feature of the man. So he had a bit the best of Don Quixote and the best of Hamlet, right? I would say that duality at its best gives rise to Narsimha Rao. And that is really the central feature of this book. If he was only a thinker, he would not have been able to transform India. And if he was a doer, he wouldn't know what to transform and how to go about it."

        "message": "Now, here's my other question, and a key way in which Narsimha Rao is different from so many people before and after him in Indian politics. You know, I'd once written a column on Narendra Modi based on something a friend of his told me. This person was friendly with him in the aughties, he worked with him in Gujarat. And she described how she was once at his home, and it was a gathering of personal friends and people he knew personally. And Mr. Modi started telling a story about how his mother had been very ill once. And he went to switch on the fan and he switched it on and the fan didn't turn on because there was no electricity. And as he said, narrated the story, he started crying. And my friend's point in telling me the story about Modi was that he is an experiential Prime Minister, what I would call an aankho dekhi politician. So when he comes to power in Gujarat as Chief Minister, what are his priorities? It's electricity because he's experienced it himself. It's roads because he's walked on them, he's experienced it himself. But his great failing as a Prime Minister is that his knowledge is limited to that. He is not expanding his knowledge and there are some concepts which are beyond experience, spontaneous order, positive sum game, so on and so forth. And that becomes his failing because then he cannot possibly get a handle on the economy or on the larger currents in society and so on. And the point of my column was read more because we form pictures of the world by joining dots, our experience only gives us so many dots. You have to read more. You can't blame Modi for not being a reader as a kid because circumstances, humble background, not his fault at all. But then what you should do is try to cultivate a reading habit and at least surround yourself with experts, people who know and, you know, not try to imagine that your folksy instincts will be right in every particular. And it seems that Narsimha Rao is not just the opposite of this, but that is in fact an outlier among politicians in the sense that one of the threads that struck me through your book is how this guy is constantly reading, reading, reading, learning, learning, learning. Even that example in his 60s, he gets a computer, he doesn't learn how to surf Google. I mean, there wasn't Google then. He learns three computer languages. You've described in another incident that he goes to his village and there is some fancy machine which isn't working. And he actually opens it up himself, figures out that the steel is dry and that might be one reason the motor is not rotating and he has it lubricated with kerosene and the next day it works. That's right. So, and again, a man of action here. And this is really a combination in a sense of the introspective Hamlet thinking about stuff and Don Quixote actually acting on it. This I find remarkable because I, you know, I can't think of other figures in Indian society. Definitely Nehru, obviously a very well-read man and also a man of action, but also a man closed in certain ways to reconsidering his priors, whereas Narasimha Rao till the end of his life was always reconsidering his priors, most notably for liberalization, because he was a socialist until then. So tell me about this sort of aspect of the man and how this played into what his trajectory was that like at one level, it is a bunch of accidents which take him to the top. At another level, it is the fact that he wasn't tribal and therefore he was always a contributor or a convenient compromise candidate, whether when he became chief minister or prime minister or whatever. But was this urge also a big factor? And does it not make doubly tragic that the elites of Delhi, you know, look down on him almost as a country bumpkin kind of person? You know, there's a story where Rajiv Gandhi is sitting with a friend and Narasimha Rao, you know, just puts his foot on his lap and he's scratching his foot, which is like a"

But it brings to a different sort of insecurity that Narasimha Rao had, which is that he was a man of enormous learning, right? Yet it was a learning unmediated by the West. So he, you know, I think English was the fifth language he learned. So he was already a cosmopolitan, right? He goes to, if my memory serves, he goes to the abroad to the US for the first time only in 1952, right? To visit his daughter Saraswati, who's having her first child. He goes to New York and that's a transformative experience. But you know, that's the first time he goes there. He was an accomplished translator from Marathi to Telugu, from Hindi to Telugu. He could campaign, you know, like in India, we know of people campaigning in two different constituencies. But when was the last time you heard of people campaigning simultaneously in Marathi and in Telugu, right? When he was campaigning in Hanamkonda, because he contested two seats, Hanamkonda and Ramtek. Ramtek is near Nagpur in Maharashtra. He's contesting in two languages. And then he contests later on in Bairampur in Odisha and campaigns in Odia, right? So here was a man under whom, you know, to be honest with you, Rajiv Gandhi is an intellectual pygmy, right? I mean, no disrespect to Rajiv Gandhi, but where and where are we talking about? And yet look at the stereotypes we build for ourselves that somebody who goes to Cambridge University and somebody who may have gone, you know, to an elite school, Doon School or whatever is, I'm not sure Rajiv went there, I think he did."

As Natwar Singh told me, and I quoted in the book, Natwar Singh was former foreign minister of India. Unlike Nehru, Narsimha Rao did not have to discover India. He already knew it. He had a deep sense of the local indigenous culture of India and cultures of India. You know, his Urdu was so good that when the president of Pakistan, Farooq Lagari comes to Delhi, Narsimha Rao talks to him and his Urdu is better than Farooq Lagari's Urdu. As a student, his Persian was excellent. So this is a man who was an unusual cosmopolitan, but Amit, I have to emphasize this that lot of people see this aspect to Narsimha Rao to the exclusion of his action oriented side. They see this as the Hamlet side of Narsimha Rao, not the Don Quixote side. Narsimha Rao had held every single position in India, you know, from a local position to state minister, chief minister, union minister, before he became prime minister. He had a ton of conventional experience. In that sense, when Rajiv Gandhi died, he was a conventional candidate because he was the most experienced candidate in government. You know, there was talk of him as you mentioned earlier in this episode of him becoming president of India in I think 1982 and again 1987. So he was almost up there, right? And so in some sense, he was an uncommon intellect. He had uncommon experience and a man of action. That combination is very, very, very hard to find, you know. And I think India was, you know, this is one of the central points of the book that India was very lucky to have a man with this kind of intellect, this kind of experience and this kind of action oriented self when India had this kind of crisis in 1991. So it was a, India, you know, should thank its stars that the confluence of events that took place in 1991 was luckily in India's favor. It could, you know, just imagine in a similar situation, Andy Tiwari, who is not a man of action, who is not particularly learned and who has experience. So I give him that, right? He has been chief minister of, several times he has been chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Then he became chief minister of Uttarakhand. But he lacks the other two, he's not a man of action."

I was, you know, looking at just immediately post-independency alliance against the Nizam. And you write about it, quote, the ensuing struggle against the Nizam brought together the unlikeliest of allies. The Indian National Congress wanted to dethrone him and integrate Hyderabad straight into secular democratic India. The Hindu Mahasabha and Arya Samaj disliked the Islamic ruler, and in Telangana region, an armed insurrection against landlords had morphed into a communist rebellion. These three elements gave rise to an anti-Nizam movement that was secular, religious and radical all at once, stop quote. And so there is a scaldron where there are all these different forces coming together. And Narasimha Rao is a young man, he's in his late 20s at this point, kind of watching all of this. He has, you know, one mentor in Ramananda Tirtha, who is more of a radical kind of leader. Another leader is sort of Burgula Ramakrishna Rao, as you describe, much more moderate."

The Congress Party is India at that time. Some of your younger listeners may find that hard to believe when they see today's Congress Party, but the Congress was India. And the Congress structure was built around different factions, right? So there was no opposition party of any worth. So the opposition parties of India were within the Congress. So there was a left wing, there was a right wing, there was a Dalit wing, there was a Brahmin wing, there was a pro-landlord wing, there was a pro-tenant wing, there was a pro-farmer wing, there was a pro-consumer wing. That's the nature of Congress Party. And at another level, there was a Burgul Ramkrishna Rao wing, there was a Ramananthirtha wing. In other words, there were factions which are based on personalities as much as ideology, something that you see in India even today. So you and I, Amit, are in Maharashtra. And if you look at the Congress today in Maharashtra, well, it may be very small, but even so there's a Prithviraj Chavan wing, there's a Ashok Chavan wing, etc., etc. That's just a structure of the Congress, right? And when all these different wings and faction leaders are fighting about who should become chief minister, no one of them can become chief minister because the others threaten to leave. And what you end up with is a consensus candidate, right? That's what you end up with. Nassim Rao's genius was he was always a consensus candidate because he never had a faction behind him. He never sought to cultivate people. He never sought to build a power base. Now, this might sound foolish, you know, in politics, you should have chamchas, you should have cronies. Nassim Rao lacked this. That's why he was seen as safe by everybody around him. That's why in 1971, he becomes chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. And I must emphasize here for those of you who haven't read the book Half Lion that, that period 1971 to 73 is very important in understanding Nassim Rao because that's when he is Don Quixote, you know, Indira Gandhi selects him because she wants to push for a left wing reform, which is land reform in Andhra Pradesh. She wants to move, land has already moved from the zamindars to the revenue intermediaries, the Deshmukhs or the Doras, who are the spine of the Congress party. These are the Reddys, the Brahmins, the Khammas. And Indira Gandhi wants to move the next level to give land to the tiller and to the landless Dalits. And that's what Nassim Rao decides to do. He gives provocative speeches. This antagonizes landlords. This antagonizes other castes such as Khammas and Reddys. They protest against him. And Nassim Rao who feels he's in an honorable cause, he's a rebel, he's a revolutionary, he goes all out, he goes on the forefront. The protests he gets are so strong, Nassim Rao has to step down. Indira Gandhi asks him to step down and he feels his career is over. The big lesson he learns from this is that if you want to bring about reform, you have to do it through the back door. You have to do it subtly, otherwise the enemies to reform will gang up against you and you will have, you will be destroyed, you will have to step down. It's the single biggest learning he takes as Prime Minister. There's no doubt in his mind that India has to change on economics, on welfare schemes, on foreign policy, but he has to do it in a way that doesn't antagonize his enemies, that doesn't antagonize those who are upholding the older order. For that you need subterfuge, you need to pretend to not do anything while doing something. That is Nassim Rao's great genius and he learns that by being a failure as Chief Minister. Now look, many Chief Ministers in India fail, many politicians fail. What makes Nassim Rao unique is he converts his own failure into a learning experience and he realizes what not to do and when he comes back to power, he's a chastened man, which means you must reform, you must change, India has to change, but you have to do it in a way in which you pretend to continuity and that is the genius of Nassim Rao."

He's not a, you know, mass leader in that sense, so he always won the elections he contested, but except the very first one, but he's not a mass leader in that sense and he's politically weak, but he's been put in a position of strength, but he can't really do much in that position of strength as he finds out when he's in his Don Quixote phase.

I mean, I would look upon that period, which is 1967, 68, 69, 70, all the way to 71, as I would say the worst four years in India's first republic, because by deinstitutionalizing the Congress by doing exactly what you said, Indira Gandhi sets the tone for other political parties. So all the regional parties, caste based parties that are growing in India post 1967, they are looking at the Indira Gandhi model of the Congress, not the Nehru model of the Congress. And even today, if you look at the state we are in, right, Shiv Sena is completely deinstitutionalized. You know, the father headed the Shiv Sena, now the son heads it and his chief minister and, you know, soon the grandson will head it, right, Aditya Thackeray would head it. And in doing so, you know, older leaders, leaders who want to rise will go, you know, will be furious, right? The same deinstitutionalized story you are seeing in the DMK to some extent, right? The father has given way to Stalin. And a lot of the regional bosses are like, when will our turn come, right? So that's, so the tragedy that you mentioned that is going on during this period, 67 to 71, is not just something Indira Gandhi inflicts on the Congress. It's something that by mimicking, right, all other political parties bar the communists and the BJP are mimicking, are taking from Indira Gandhi. And I think that's a serious tragedy. And I think one of the big problems in Indian politics is how deinstitutionalized and hollowed out parties have become in India. And I worry that that period set the template for it."

For example, I was telling you just before this that I read this delightful sort of essay on Leela Naidu by one of her friends, where Leela Naidu, he mentions at one point that when she grew older, she would constantly share gossip with him. And one of the pieces of gossip that she shared is that she had heard that Indira Gandhi's daughters-in-law kept the fridge locked, so that the servants could not access the food because they were worried the servants would steal the food. So they didn't care if the food went to waste. But they kept the fridge locked because they wanted control of it. And that feels like what the Gandhis have actually done to the Congress Party today. Of course, when I mentioned this before the recording, you gave the counterpoint to that, that in 2009, one would not have said this. But that is kind of where we are. But then does that centralizing impulse inevitably mean that there will be feudalism? Because if there aren't alternative leaders around a leader to challenge them, then the family or the people, you know, in the greatest proximity to power will eventually make sure they hold the power and their popular leaders simply therefore aren't allowed to emerge"

Which is that the family says that look, unless we have a family, the second-rung leaders are so corrupt and so self-serving, that they will split the party and destroy the party. That unfortunately also happens to be true. So today, if you say that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi should leave the party, I don't quite trust the others in the political party, right? But that is a consequence of now several decades of hauling out that began with Indira Gandhi. Indira Gandhi is right to say that eventually there was nobody but Indira Gandhi who could hold the party together, but that's a process that she started. And so, you know, Sonia Gandhi today is in this conundrum, right? Which is that it is a feudal party in the sense that, you know, or let's say it's a family-based party, but the alternative to a family-based party might even be worse. It may not be a democratic party, right? The instincts of the second-tier Congress leaders that we see today are not particularly non-feudal, right? So you are choosing between two suboptimal or two worse outcomes. In one outcome, you have the Nehru-Gandhis in power, in the other outcome, you don't have them in power and things are even worse in the Congress, right? So I do feel that that period is a terrible period in India and it could have gone differently. I mean, frankly, Indira Gandhi, had she not done this, maybe in the 1971 elections, the Congress would have lost, but you know, they lost six years later in 1977. All that meant was Indira Gandhi six years earlier would have been in opposition, she would have come back to power, but she wouldn't have destroyed the party for just three, four extra years in power."

I think power corrupts, but that doesn't follow that the cadre is destroyed and one individual seizes power. It doesn't follow. Right? I'll give you the DMK example that even though Stalin is in power, they still have somewhat of a cadre, the communists, of course, they don't have power, but they still have somewhat of a cadre. The BJP definitely has a strong cadre, right? And it remains so and the RSS plays a big role in keeping that happening. I would, I would actually say the following that given that Modi is so much more popular than his party, right, it is surprising that in the in the in the BJP, both Amit Shah and Modi follow the formal protocols of the party, even though they don't have to, right? And I would say that after Modi and after Amit Shah, the BJP's health will be immeasurably better than it was when they took the party. So I'm actually going to stick my neck out and say that both Amit Shah and Modi are institutional builders. It is the reality in India today that Modi, you know, is the number one leader in the BJP. And the number two leader is actually number 10, because Modi is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And the next leader, you can call it Adityanath, Amit Shah, whoever, is actually the 10th most popular leader in the BJP. And that even though Modi is a centralizer, his instincts, he has not destroyed the party, the party still has autonomous centers, the RSS is still autonomous, the reason they go behind him is actually a pretty simple reason, he wins elections. If he stops winning elections, people in the BJP will complain, right? So I'll actually push back on that just to tell you that there is an alternate model that the Congress could have followed, which is, but it would have been a party would then would have had to focus on an ideological core, and would have had to articulate an ideological, not just a catch all party, but a certain clear ideology. In the 1960s, that ideology sometimes wins, you sometimes loses, the BJP had the same ideology for 100 years. And they have won elections, they have lost elections, the Congress's tragedy and Indra's tragedy was, she could not conceive of an India without the Congress. And she was willing to do what it takes to just give the Congress a little more power for a little more years. And that came at the cost of the destruction of the party. So I'm going to push back and look, many people disagree with me on this saying that look in India, the de institutionalization of a party is the norm is inevitable. And that power corrupts, right? And an individual in power will always try to, you know, make it a mom and pop show. I don't think it was inevitable. That's certainly not the party that Nehru ran. There was no reason that that would be the party that Indira Gandhi ran."

        "message": "That's an important question, Amit, because, and just take a step back for a second. Most politicians don't know what to do with exiles, because they are 24-7 politicians, right? Exile means that you've lost an election, you've stepped down as Chief Minister, all the hundreds of people waiting to meet you have disappeared. There's nobody willing to meet you. If you don't have hobbies, what else do you do? Right? Narsimha Rao was very good at exile because he had hobbies. You know, he could even paint, he could, you know, he could read books, right, he could learn languages, you know, he could, you know, when the first exile between 1973 and 74, he begins to write the book that would eventually become the Insider, right? So he knew, he had things to occupy himself during exile. This is very rare for politicians, which is why politicians when they are in exile, and all politicians will be in exile at some point or other, make foolish mistakes like leaving the party, making statements, making compromises to get back to power, to get something to get a Rajya Sabha ticket, Narsimha Rao didn't have to do that. And I think that's what made him unique. The other person, by the way, who had this is Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was a man with a lot of interest, poetry, he loved the good life, he had, like Narsimha Rao, he had a philosophical attitude to life. So when he was not in power, right, he had things to occupy himself, when he was sidelined in my first book, I point out that from roughly 1985, all the way to 1995, for 10 years, he had been exiled from his party functionally, but you know, he knew things to occupy himself, he didn't do anything foolish as leaving the party, splitting the party, etc, etc. So Narsimha Rao was both used to exile, and B, did not do anything foolish during exile, which meant that when the stars realigned, Indira Gandhi got him back as General Secretary, right? Again, in 1991, a few months before the elections, when Rajiv Gandhi basically kicked him out of politics, Narsimha Rao said, fine, I'm going to use this exile, I'm going to become a monk in the Kotralam monastery, and I'm going to become a Hindu monk, I'm going to close my bank accounts, right? Somebody else could have said, who does Rajiv Gandhi think he is, put a press conference, etc, etc. And you know what, if he had done that, and Rajiv Gandhi had been assassinated, the Congress wouldn't have gone to him to become Prime Minister, they went to him to become Prime Minister because he accepted his exile with grace. And I want to give you the contrary picture of N.D. Tiwari, also who was in his last legs in the 1991 elections, and Rajiv had told him don't contest the Lok Sabha elections. But N.D. Tiwari was worried that his chance to become Chief Minister in 91 was ending in UP. And as you know, as your readers know, the Samadwadi party, etc comes to power, the Congress has been finished since then, has never come back in UP. So N.D. Tiwari knew this. So he disobeyed an order of Rajiv Gandhi and stood for Lok Sabha elections in UP and lost. And that's one of the main reasons why he could not become Prime Minister when Rajiv died, because he had disobeyed an order of Rajiv Gandhi, right? So this is an example of Narasimha Rao who doesn't make foolish decisions during his exile. I'll give you a third example, Amit, which is in 1977 to 1980, another period of exile for Narasimha Rao. As all of you know, that's when the Janata government is in power, Indira Gandhi, cases have been filed against Indira Gandhi. Many of Indira Gandhi's close supporters like YB Chavan leave the Congress during this period. Narasimha Rao doesn't leave the Congress. What does he do? He goes to JNU to learn Spanish. He doesn't make a foolish mistake, right? He bides his time. So in 1980, when Indira Gandhi comes back to power, Narasimha Rao is one of the few people to have remained loyal to Indira Gandhi during the three years in which she had been hounded by everybody else. So how does Indira Gandhi reward him? She makes him Foreign Minister of India, which is one of the top four ministries in the Union Cabinet. It tells you that Narasimha Rao's big talent was that he knew how to occupy himself during exile, and he did not make foolish short term decisions to come back to power during exile. He knew that, look, he had a philosophical turn, what goes down comes up, you know, and that's exactly what happens to him. I know that's a long answer to your question, but does that make sense?"

And at this time, like you said earlier, he also made an American trip. He visited his daughter and so on and so forth. And this time being 1973-74, so is this a significant trip? Is this something that we look at as changing his outlook in any way in the sense that he was a classic socialist all the time before that, you know, even when he was a modernizer, as you've pointed out in the 60s, it was a modernizer from a point of view of the state doing modernizing things and not, you know, liberalizing and enabling people and markets to do what they do. So did this sort of, and he had a love for technology, you point out how on another trip he brought back a Texas calculator for his son and all of that, he was into that. So, you know, he's in India all his life, he goes to the US, he sees how life there is so much better and all that. Does that, you know, change his outlook? You also mentioned at one point that he realizes when he's spending time in his village with villagers that the land reforms alone haven't changed anything, that they're still poor, and that therefore the handouts don't solve the problem, you also need to connect them to markets where they can flourish through voluntary trade with others. And in some cases, he manages to do that where he moves them from rice, which is an unprofitable crop to other cash crops, and, you know, they enter markets and start making money. So is there some kind of discernible metamorphosis happening in ideological terms? Because initially, why he was socialist in his 60s, what else could you be back then? You know, I can't, it's easy to sit here in 2022 and talk about economic freedom and this and that. At that point in time, there was no exposure to those ideas, there wasn't widespread understanding of the failures of socialism as we have today. So that's completely understandable. But over time, do we see sort of a gradual shift? And also in general, through reading his papers, writing this biography, what comment would you have on his openness to new ideas, which is also a remarkably important quality, a quality which, for example, Nehru didn't have, right, much to our nation's detriment, you know, and no politician, I mean, I can't think of any politicians who really have as much of that as Narsimha Rao clearly did.

You know, he travels quite a bit in the, I mean, in within New York, he's traveling, he's amazing, you know, he buys calculators from Texas Instruments, he goes to Wisconsin, and he meets, you know, this famous Telugu scholar, Velchiru Narayan Rao. And in, you know, Madison, Wisconsin, he, you know, he's invited for dinner, and he finds the best Telugu food. And he's saying, you know, all these ingredients you're getting here in the Midwest, I can't even get in North India, you know. So he sees the power of American capitalism, and he sees the dynamism and entrepreneurship in America quite clearly, right? And the next time he's visiting the US, he's now an expert on the US. So his eldest daughter, who's, who's accompanying him, who I think is semi literate, she sees a washing machine, she doesn't use know how to use it, and I'll teach you how to use the washing machine. He's now the expert, he's been this, you know, second time. So he definitely is very excited, like a child about the, you know, entrepreneurship, technological improvement in the US, that directly manifests itself when he's foreign minister. So in 1980, to onwards, when he's foreign minister, you also see India moving away from the Soviet Union towards the US, right? That doesn't manifest itself in his economic policies. So Narsimha Rao, one of the things I realized was that on economics, he was a cipher until 1991. It was the, you know, he had held so many positions from Hindu, Hindu Endowment Board, you know, industry, defense, foreign policy, he had held all this, he'd never held economics or sorry, he had not held industry either. So he never held finance, economics, he never held these positions. There's nothing in his archives that showed that the either the US trip or his in the 80s, his economic thinking had changed, you know, he didn't have much to think about it, whatever little he thought about it was still protectionist. It was really 1991 that transformed him and he realized the crisis, he realized that we had to change. I think it's amazing that he changes on, he just flips on a dime at that point, right? And I was actually looking in the 70s for this aha moment where he realizes the importance of liberalization and the importance of capitalism. I just couldn't find it, you know, there's a very famous story, possibly apocryphal of Gorbachev, right, traveling in the United States. And I think his car breaks down somewhere, it's an apocryphal story, I haven't been able to find a footnote. And you know, there's a Walmart nearby, he goes there to a Walmart, right, in rural America, and he's amazed at the range of things that Walmart carries. And suddenly he has a eureka moment that he, right, as the head of Soviet Union, as a Soviet elite has less products he can buy in Moscow, than a rural American farmer who goes to Walmart in rural America. And that's when he has this aha moment about the power of capitalism and actually giving consumers choice. So I had the story in the back of my mind. And I kept looking to see whether there was this aha moment, when Nassima Rao goes to US or after and I couldn't find it, I was unhappy, I couldn't find it. But you know, I wanted to be or I had too much of a commitment to my reader to manufacture it. And the answer has to be Amit that on economics, he did not have a change until 1991. On other things, especially foreign policy, the ardent socialist had softened his position, but not on economics."

But he notices something others don't, which is Deng is transforming China while pretending to be a Maoist, like Deng is making China capitalist while pretending to be a communist. And I have a quote here saying that, you know, where he's where Nassima Rao says that Deng Joe Ping reminds him of one of those Sanskrit shlokas or Sanskrit quotations, which the same sentence can be read one way or read the other way, right. And I mentioned here also that one of Nassima Rao's favorite Telugu poems was this poem, which if you read it one way, it was the Ramayana, the same text, if you read a different way, it was the Mahabharata, right. And Nassima Rao loved that. And that's frankly, exactly what he did as prime minister that he said, I'm a Nehruvian, I'm a socialist, India believes in socialism while he's opening up India's economy, right. That's what he learned from Deng. So it's not so much the importance of the economy, but the how to bring about change in a system that is so one way, you cannot have radical changes, you have to pretend to continuity while bringing more change. And just to give you an example, after reading this book, you know, a CEO came to me, and she told me that she had just become CEO. And her first instinct was to say that the previous CEO is a fool, and I'm going to bring about changes, and I'm going to make this change that change. But she said, Look, I read your book, and I realized that if I do that, then all the people the old CEO has appointed who are still there in the system will resent her, and we'll we'll push back against her. So what she had to say was that, oh, the previous CEO was fantastic, all his choices was fantastic while she brought about changes, which were radically different from the old CEO. And I said, man, you understood this book much better than I have, because that's exactly the point of Nassima Rao. And I can tell you, Amit, any of your listeners listening to this, who work in organizations, right, realize that, you know, will agree with me that changing the DNA of organizations are really hard. And socialism was in the DNA of the Indian state was in the DNA of the Congress Party, just like communism was in the DNA of the Chinese state. And the way to do it is the Deng Xiaoping and Nassima Rao way, which is to pretend to continuity in a system, while simultaneously through your actions bringing about radical"

And this is pretty much as profound an insight from politics that can be applied to everything as say, Doris Keynes Goodwin's team of rivals, right, how Lincoln put his cabinet together, where instead of just putting his supporters in his cabinet, he got his greatest rivals, including the guy he defeated in the presidential elections and put them in the cabinet. And that was one big reason for his success in winning the Civil War. And that's almost cliched. I mean, both of these could be LinkedIn posts, in a sense, which are so, you know, Pranam Mukherjee once told Nassima Rao that during this period, he thought Nassima Rao was invaluable to Indira Gandhi, she could not function without him. So tell me about what he's actually doing in government, like, one gets that when he's out of power, he's not creating a political fuss, because there are other facets to his personality. He's learning Spanish, he's going abroad and buying calculator, he's doing all of these things. And the way that he gets to power is often by being inoffensive to everyone in the sense that this is not someone who threatens me. So let me give him an important ministry like foreign ministry or so on and so forth. But when he's actually in power, when he's in that position, one in terms of governance in the ministry itself, what is his approach and what is the kind of work that he is doing? And how do you rate him as a minister? And two, in a political sense, as Indira Gandhi's aid, what's his role there? And what role is he playing for her?"

        "message": "So I think that as in government, Nassima Rao was good at three different things. Firstly, he was just a consummate draftsman. So I would say that, you know, from the 1970s, every piece of paper that would exit the Congress party would have his fingerprints on it. So he just knew, you know, in a cabinet meeting, he knew how to, you know, write what the minute look like, he knew what to write the cabinet agenda. So, you know, now look, Pranam Mukherjee was good at this, Jayaram Ramesh is very good at this, right? So this was a talent that Nassima Rao had that he was a draftsman, right? The second talent he had is that in any ministry that he took charge of, he quickly understood the issues because he applied himself, right? So a lot of ministers think of a ministry as an ego trip, right? So Nassima Rao didn't think that. So for example, he had been defence minister and foreign minister and Rajiv Gandhi made him education minister or HRD minister. Now, for most people, this is a demotion, but Nassima Rao is not a demotion. He quickly gets in, he understands the mechanics of the Navodaya school, you know, he knew all of that. So I think the second thing that he was very good at was in the ministry, he would very quickly get to the issues. And he was a good, he could brief the Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi or Indira Gandhi about the issues because he actually applied himself to the specifics of the ministry. When it came to foreign policy, you know, he, you know, he told his son, his grandson, I think, when Nassima Rao travelled to a country, he first read up about the country, the culture, the people, the politics. Can you think of any other foreign minister in India bar Jai Shankar doing that? Out of the question, right? Again, when he was defence minister, I mentioned here, he's quickly, you know, getting involved in the nuclear program, this, that and later on when Arunachalam, who was heading the nuclear program at that time comes to him, and you know, he says, you please draw out what the nuclear process looks like, he said, okay, this is where the chain reaction takes place. So he's getting involved. And then he's briefing Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. That's a skill. Ask yourself, even today, how many ministers actually have depth in their department or their subject expertise, rather than looking at the ministry or being a minister as an ego trip, which tells them their relative importance in the pecking order, for most of people, it's in the latter, right? The third skill Nassima Rao had was that he could balance action and theory very well, right? So, for example, and these were skills that he came to as prime minister also, and this is outside his department. For example, he told Rajiv Gandhi that, you know, getting involved in Sri Lanka is an error, right? Rajiv Gandhi didn't listen to him. But he said that, right? On the other hand, he pushed for the Navodaya schooling system, which is residential schools for poor people, where the teacher actually lives in the place, right? So that to prevent teacher absenteeism, because the teacher is living in the school, the teacher is less likely to bunk and Rajiv Gandhi, you know, took, you know, took charge of that or agreed with that. So he had this ability, I think all three, right? He was a good draftsman. He had subject matter expertise. So he was as good as the bureaucrat. To give you an example, Modi today, by all accounts, listens to the secretary in every department, every ministry rather than listening to the minister. Narsimha Rao knew as much about foreign politics or foreign policy as the foreign secretary, right? I unearthed a document here, which the Indian ambassador to China writes to Narsimha Rao, right? About the Chinese situation and Narsimha Rao is writing in the notes on the margins, highly detailed pushbacks. I don't know too many ministers who could second guess a foreign secretary or an ambassador, because an Indian ambassador to a country has subject matter expertise, right? So I would say Narsimha Rao had all these three. It's a unique skill, but you know, look, Pranab Mukherjee had these skills, right? He was invaluable too, right? What he lacked which Narsimha Rao had is the ability to act and to act decisively when he became prime minister."

And so I won't go over that sort of area again. But once the new cabinet sort of settles down, and now he's made the defense minister, you know, what's the scene like? Because what Rajiv Gandhi does is he gets a whole bunch of his cronies, people he's been to school with many of them at Doon School. So people like Arun Singh and Satish Sharma and Arun Nehru was there, Mani Shankar Iyer, all of these people. So he gets these Lutyens elite as it were, and these are the Lutyens elite I think we truly should look down upon.

So he's as ambitious as, you know, complexity is both ambitious and unambitious. But he certainly wants to continue to be in power. His single focus is to be as close and useful to Rajiv Gandhi as he was to Indira Gandhi. The most important thing is he recognizes what you just said, that he's an outsider in Team Rajiv, right? And he has to reinvent himself. And I have this wonderful story here about how he overhears Rajiv Gandhi making some allusion to computers. He's not heard the phrase before. You know, this is the mid 80s, right? And Narsimha Rao is in the 60s. And he asks his son, what is this computer? Send me a, you know, send me a sample. And his son sends him a sample from Hyderabad to Delhi of a computer. It comes by Indian Airlines. And Narsimha Rao doesn't, you know, you know, hire somebody to teach him, does that a little bit and as I mentioned, very soon learns COBOL, BASIC and UNIX, right? And it's just an example of how Narsimha Rao is using his skill at curiosity to refashion himself and retool himself to be as useful to Rajiv Gandhi as he is to Indira Gandhi. And he successfully so. He becomes foreign minister again. For Rajiv Gandhi to give him the education ministry is not actually a demotion from defense, but he's giving it to him because he feels that Narsimha Rao has something to offer and something to add to it, right? And for him, education is a priority sector. So Narsimha Rao is retooling himself. But you know, by the time he, Narsimha Rao reaches 1991, he's old, Rajiv Gandhi decides that his career is over, right? He tries again to become president in 1987. But his close friend R Venkatraman, who was the same vintage at him become president himself, but Narsimha Rao could have become president. He was well within the realm of becoming president. But the key thing here is that when Rajiv Gandhi asks him to step down, doesn't give him a ticket, Narsimha Rao doesn't rebel. As I mentioned earlier, he accepts with equanimity his fall. Most politicians will create a ruckus, give a press conference, abuse, Narsimha Rao doesn't do that, right? And yet, as I point out, there's a key moment when Narsimha Rao hears that Rajiv Gandhi has been murdered, when at the time he hears it, he's in shock, a doctor has to come to kind of settle him down. But very soon, in just a few hours, he realizes that by virtue of being one of the senior most leaders of the Congress, who stepped down when the Nehru-Gandhis asked him to do it, he is now best primed to become prime minister. And within a few hours, he's, you know, he's, he's, you know, moving to Delhi, maneuvering, trying to become prime minister. That's that's amazing political instinct. And it taught me that Narsimha Rao's key skill was when he realized that the cards he had been dealt with are not good. And I'm sure there's a poker analogy, Amit, I just don't know enough poker, he, you know, he knows he has a bad hand, so he plays it on defense. And when suddenly the hand turns for him, he ends up with a good hand, he plays aggressively. Is there an analogy in poker for that?"

And while Narsimha Rao is there, and just you know, just an advertisement to the reader, this book is being made into an OTT series directed by Prakash Jha. And I've requested Mr. Jha that they must have this visual, which is that the dead body is there and then around them all these congressmen in white wearing the Congress topi are all pretending to cry, but actually they're doing guspus on who to succeed, right. And suddenly what happens is that Narsimha Rao writes in his diary that while we and I'm quoting here, while we were hanging around the dead body in 10 Janpat, Pranab took me aside and told me that there was genuine agreement on me being elected Congress President. Rao doesn't say yes, yes, I should become Congress President, because if he does that, Pranab will tell everybody look Narsimha Rao wants to become Congress President and then everybody would gun for him. So Narsimha Rao, this is what Narsimha Rao says, I knew that Pranab's report was too good to be true, either he was himself a dupe or he was party to some kind of design and was trying to lull me. He had done this role many times in those crucial years of Indiraji, I did not want to react. I mentioned about my health and said I was I feel a bit diffident, Narsimha Rao is pretending to Pranab. I suggested NDT who is ND Tiwari instead, taking care to add that I was not refusing yet it would be good if he came up after a consensus. I also knew that ND Tiwari would be unacceptable as or more so than myself in the scheme of things. This paragraph tells me everything you want to know about Narsimha Rao maneuvering.

Now before we get to the 1991 phase when he takes over as PM, a final question I want to ask you about the earlier period which comes from something really interesting where you point out that there were once a set of papers you know with the heading human resource development and there were a bunch of papers and and that happened to have an excerpt that happened to have something that Rao had handwritten himself and that included, I'll read this bit out, quote with human resource development as a heading it contained an excerpt from an author Rao enjoyed, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, I hope I'm pronouncing that right and the excerpt is this is the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's words, quote a rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it bearing within him the image of a cathedral, stop quote. Incredible quote right and now your words continue, below this Rao had written woman and child development, health, youth affairs, sports, culture, labor, question mark and you continue, the note was returned to Rao and he slipped it into the pocket of his kurta later that morning he went to see the Prime Minister which is Rajiv Gandhi, he told Rajiv stop quote and now Rao's words we see a rock pile of disorganized underutilized human resources you see a cathedral, you see a cathedral, we can fashion it but we need to go beyond just the ministry of education, stop quote and now you continue Rao persuaded Rajiv to integrate the departments of culture, youth affairs, sports, women and child development and later health with education into the new HRD ministry, stop quote. Like first of all I just love this image of somebody sees a rock pile and somebody sees a cathedral, a stunning image and also it seems to me that all of these you know culture, youth affairs, sports, women and child development are amenable to scaling right. You make a small difference here, it reverberates into something much bigger, it's not static, it scales massively and that's exactly the thing about liberalization as well that economic freedom also scales in a similar way where the state is playing an enabling part as it does in all of these subjects you know and this struck me as really interesting and kind of wise from Rao in getting you know I mean I don't know if he chose this ministry or asked for it or whatever but he was clearly reveling in it but in these specific subjects and labor was left out because it had more to do with taking care of the interests of labor currently and all of that not so scalable but unless you change the labor laws which of course hurt labor more than they help them but that's a different story but all of these are extremely scalable and liberalization in the end also proves to be that. So does this sort of indicate that his mindset is broader and thinking at you know a different kind of level than the typical politician who when in put in charge of a ministry may have an engineering mindset that let us tinker, we will fix this, we will fix that, we will fix this but is he perhaps showing a more of an enabling mindset here which also might explain why he was more open to Naresh Chandra's note as cabinet secretary so a few years later."

He was education minister and health minister in Andhra Pradesh, he was education minister in Delhi so he knew how the state education function, how the center education function and he had imagination to say let's transform and he found in Rajiv Gandhi a willing prime minister because Rajiv was passionate about this too right. I don't see this on in economics, I just don't see it. He was a same old stodgy protectionist right and you know again I've thought about this many many times that is there some because there's so much from his life that tells you about how he was prime minister in other ways like how he managed the politics of reform, how he managed welfare schemes, foreign policy. There isn't anything about economics you know and as a biographer I have to go with the evidence and all evidence points to the fact that he was a mild protectionist on economics. He hadn't really thought about it but when Naresh Chandra shows him that note he wakes up. He says India has to change and once he decides to do that he moves with remarkable alacrity."

        "message": "So just to give you a background before I answer that question. Since the early 1980s there was a push within the Indian system to liberalize the economy in terms of ideas. So there was an LK Jha report, there was an Abid Hussain report, Montek Singh had, Alu Walia had authored a famous M document, you know, and Rakesh Mohan had also authored a new industrial policy. What were all these pushing back against? All these were pushing back against what we call the License Quota Permit Raj. What was this License Quota Permit Raj? It had three components. First was that it closed off large sections of the Indian economy to private entrepreneurs. Only the public sector could enter and where, for example, making watches, only HMT could do it and HMT was used to making heavy tools, Hindustan machine tools, heavy industry. So you ended up with terrible HMT watches that people still wore because they didn't have any options. And you had then a few sectors where the government, their private sector could participate, but they needed all kinds of licenses. So that was the first thing the government did. The second thing as part of the License Quota Permit Raj was that the size of private companies was stymied by making capital difficult for them because of bank nationalization, right, by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, for example. So many ways in which the size of private businesses was stymied, they couldn't actually access the capital markets without permission from the what was called a CCI at that time. The third element was you were sealing off India from the world. So heavy tariffs when it, entry barriers when it came to foreign goods, heavy restrictions on foreign capital entering India, a rupee that was artificially valued, so it made exports very difficult, etc, etc, etc, right. Since the 80s, many bureaucrats were making arguments that these three pillars had to be dismantled, right. The blueprint that Nassim Harao got was essentially a dismantling of these three wings, right, to make most of the Indian economy accessible to the private sector to invest, right, to reduce restrictions on the growth of the private sector, and three, to allow foreign capital and goods to enter India, right. This was what the blueprint talked about. The blueprint also said that unless you do it, the Indian foreign exchange was so low that we would default on an IMF loan, we didn't have enough money. I mention in the book reasons, short term reasons for why the Indian economy was suffering, why we lacked foreign capital. Listeners only have to look to Sri Lanka today to see that it was very, very similar situation. Now, hopefully Sri Lanka learns from Nassim Harao and uses this for long term reforms of the economy. Hopefully they do that. Nassim Harao was able to do that. But I just want to give you that this is the background to that particular document."

So what does he do? Firstly, he realizes that the key element is the first aspect, right, first and second aspects, which is that you have to reduce restrictions on domestic entrepreneurs, what we call internal liberalization. Step two is external liberalization, which is you have to allow foreign capital and foreign services and goods to enter India. But the first step is industrial de-licensing. So he keeps the industry ministry for himself, people forget this, right, that's a very key element, right. Second is he appoints a principal secretary who is a key bureaucrat for every prime minister who was a former industry secretary, Amarnath Verma, well known liberalizer, right. Third is he tells PC Alexander who's helping him at that time that look, I need a finance minister who is open to the world, right, who is able to assist with external liberalization and there are two names given there. The first name IG Patel, who is the head of the London School of Economics at that time says no. The second name is Manmohan Singh. So Manmohan Singh says yes, and he becomes the finance minister. And look, Manmohan Singh has many, many skills that Narsimha Rao who already knows him appreciates. One is Manmohan Singh is incorruptible, right, with an ethics of a different order from most people in politics and bureaucracy. And this is important because Narsimha Rao has an instinct even then, that liberalization will give rise to allegations of corruption. And so as the economy is opening up to the private sector, it's very important for to have a finance minister who's insulated from the shenanigans of the private sector, right, you don't want to have somebody who's friends with Dhirubhai Ambani, friends with the Tata's, friends with the Birla's and Manmohan Singh is that guy, right. Second is that while Manmohan Singh has also had multiple views on liberalization over the years, he's much more of a conviction liberalizer than Narsimha Rao. And third is that Manmohan Singh has held every single position of economic policy in the Indian government. I mean, there are five positions of economic policy in the Indian government finance secretary, finance minister, deputy chairman planning commission, chief economic advisor of India and RBI governor, Manmohan Singh has had all of them until he becomes finance minister, right. So, he knew every inch of the economic levers, he knew how to while the political cover would be given by Narsimha Rao, actually implementing it on the ground would be the person, you know, would be Manmohan Singh and Manmohan Singh was ripe for the idea. So his incorruptibility, you know, and his ability to understand every inch of economic policy in India was very important to Narsimha Rao, that's why he was selected, right. He also had other liberalizers, for example, he had P Chidambaram as Minister of Commerce, he had Montek Singh Ahluwalia playing a key role. So he surrounded himself with advisors. And what I find noteworthy in this Amit is that Manmohan Singh, I mean, Narsimha Rao wasn't insecure that he knew nothing about economics, he understood that a job needed to be done. And he said, who are the best people for the job, he and Manmohan Singh didn't have a personal equation or personal chemistry that was not relevant to Narsimha Rao. And this goes back to his childhood that here's a man who's used to being lonely, who's not used, you know, who's not looking for chamchas, cronies, you know, who will mouth what the master wants. He said, I want the best people for the job to be able to do what the job takes. I think that's a remarkable quality."

And Naushad gave his usual outspoken views on the importance of liberalization and all of that at that point. And after the meeting ended, you know, when Manmohan Singh was shaking all the hands individually one by one, he told Naushad that, you know, what you said in this meeting, please say it outside and please say it again and again, and please say it loud, you know, and just sort of indicating again, what you said about the conviction. Now, you know, you've laid out the different kind of obstacles that now existed over here. One, the Congress has a minority in Parliament.

And there is this lovely sort of passage you have, which I'm going to read out, which describes what Rao's strategy was towards dismantling the Congress legacy. And before this, one quick note of context that, you know, the Congress manifesto before this had nothing about liberalization. It was completely protectionist and it was a standard, the same old, same old. And your Para reads, quote, that afternoon Rao convened a meeting of CWC at his house. He began by saying that all the new policy did was to reverse Indira Gandhi's sharp leftward tilt in 1969 and take the country back to the more flexible 1956 policy resolution of Nehru. The Congress, Rao added, continued to believe in the commanding heights of the public sector. Having played one Nehru-Gandhi against another, Rao now let his finance minister speak, learning from his political master, Manmohan invoked the 1991 manifesto to show that within it lay the seeds of the new industrial policy. This was far from the truth. But as Manmohan Singh came out of the meeting, Arjun Singh told him, quote, Dr. Singh, you have read the manifesto more carefully than we have, stop quote. And this just speaks to sort of so much sagacity to realize that what they are proposing is so incredibly radical. But everything came down to how do you frame it by framing it as a return to Nehru, which it wasn't by framing it as a continuation of the promises made in the manifesto, which it wasn't. They kind of managed to win the game. So tell me about these two games, the internal game within the Congress party to win everybody over and then the external game because they are still a minority party in parliament."

        "message": "So tell me a bit about these. So the internal story is quite fascinating because the party of Nehru and the party of Indira Gandhi saw liberalization as going against the core DNA of the Congress. So that was the core issue here. The way he went about it, I mentioned here, which is that every single liberalization document was presaged with homilies to Nehru, to Indira Gandhi, to Rajiv especially, because Narsimha Rao's crafty approach, especially when it came to Sonia Gandhi was to say that all that he's doing is what Rajiv Gandhi would have done had he not been cruelly interrupted. That was the kind of the argument, right. He also unleashed the Intelligence Bureau on the Congress. I have here, I'm quite proud of it, an Intelligence Bureau document showing who are the different congressmen and congresswomen and what are their views when it comes to liberalization and how you should deal with them. You know, so it's an actual Intelligence Bureau report. So Narsimha Rao, you know, the agencies that Modi unleashes, he's hardly the first person to unleash them, right. The Intelligence Bureau was unleashed by Narsimha Rao far, far earlier than that. When dealing with the parliament outside, Narsimha Rao survived three no confidence motions, one confidence motion, and I think one vote of thanks motion. He did it by ruthlessly splitting the, he always needed 20 or 30 votes to win because it was a minority in parliament and he did it by, let me put it bluntly by corruption, right, and other allurements by splitting smaller parties and independent parties and getting them to vote for the Congress. But that's not all he did. So for example, after the Babri Masjid demolition, when there was a no confidence motion against the Congress, Narsimha Rao went and told the left, look, you should stand with me because this is a fight about secularism. So don't talk about liberalization, let's focus on secularism and, you know, he won that handily. I think it was 300 to 100 or something like that. He won that no confidence motion. So that's the second thing he employed in parliament, which is to at key moments to basically tell the left that, look, let's not talk about liberalization. This is a fight to death against secularism. In that battle, we are on the same side against the BJP, right. He also reached out to many members, whether it was Jaswant Singh in the BJP, Vajpayee who was a good friend of his, Chandrashekhar, VP Singh. So he was constantly trying to engage with other politicians in other political parties. I think that was another skill he had. But you know, it's hard to answer this at a meta level Amit because really the way he managed the party and the way he managed Sonia Gandhi and the way he managed parliament is day to day kabaddi. It's not some meta question, day to day he's maneuvering to get, you know. So really, in some sense, Naseem Arao is, you know, they say you're living hand to mouth. He's living confidence motion from to no confidence motion. Every day he's worried that somebody would bring a no confidence motion and the government would fall. And look at this, his temporal circumstances, the two governments before him, both minority governments collapse within a year, right. The three governments after him, also minority governments collapse nearly within a year, right. So he alone was able to last five years, and I think that is incredible. And that's, again and again, I want to emphasize that unless you know that story, liberalization doesn't happen, right? Unless you know how power is, is accumulated, power is stabilized, and then power is expended for liberalization. Just understanding the economic policy is neither here nor there."

So you know, the policies were in the right direction, but they weren't as carefully crafted. And frankly, they didn't have the use of technology that you have today. That was something he simply didn't have. But so many reforms happened after that. And the point of that chapter, Amit, was to push against this view that it was the IMF who did it and India only reforms under crisis. There was no crisis in those three years, right? And yet so many changes, so many reforms happened. It was because both Manmohan Singh and Nassim Rao were conviction reformers."

And one of them is the demolition of the Babri Masjid, where it is common today to, you know, to blame Nassim Rao for that. And a lot of it, of course, comes from the Congress desire to disown him and wipe out his legacy. And we'll talk about that as well. Because we can't not talk about that.

So let me put it in this manner, which is, in India, the police come under the state. In June 1991, the state government of UP, where Babri Masjid is located, was won by Kalyan Singh of the BJP. He contested on the plank of demolishing the Babri Masjid and he won the election. He is a duly elected chief minister. The BJP enjoys a majority government in the state of Uttar Pradesh. They are in charge of protecting the Babri Masjid because the police, state police have to do it. This is a conundrum. So anyone who says that the Babri Masjid has to be protected, really you have to go back not to December 92, but to June 91 to say that a party has come to power in UP, which has the constitutional obligation to protect the Babri Masjid, yet its political obligation is to destroy the Babri Masjid. Should you dismiss that government? I would like your listeners to answer that question. Should you dismiss that government? Right? What do you think, Amit? Can you dismiss a government?"

As the law secretary to Nassim Rao said that, look, this is a problem because there can't be a potential for breakdown in law in order to impose article 356, there has to be an actual breakdown. You can't dismiss someone for a thought crime. Secondly, all those politicians who say that Nassim Rao should have imposed article 356, why didn't they say that before the mosque fell? Why didn't Mr. Chidambaram say before the mosque fell that Kalyan Singh should be dismissed? Why didn't Sonia Gandhi say before the mosque fell that Kalyan Singh should be dismissed? Why didn't Sharad Pawar say that? Why didn't Arjun Singh of all people say that biggest critic of Nassim Rao? The fact is that nobody was willing to give Nassim Rao the political cover to impose president's rule. And the reason for that was half the game was demolishing the mosque. The other half was demolishing Nassim Rao. And everybody was hoping that whatever happened on December 6, 1992, Nassim Rao would fall. And Nassim Rao was praying and hoping that somebody would give him political cover to impose article 356, impose president's rule, dismiss Kalyan Singh. Nobody was willing to say that. VP Singh didn't say that, Jyoti Basu didn't say that. Everyone was hemming and hawing and saying that we are concerned, we stand with the Prime Minister. But nobody was actually saying that sentence, right? Now, Nassim Rao as Prime Minister was not nobody. He was somebody who should have done it. On hindsight, he didn't. It was an error. But it was a very, very difficult decision to make. Had he imposed president's rule, definitely BJP would have brought about a no confidence motion saying murder of federalism, Congress is up to its old tricks. And Nassim Rao was not confident that his own cabinet would support him. In fact, after the demolition of Babri Masjid, when many of the cabinet ministers like Arjun Singh or ML Fortedar were complaining saying Nassim Rao, you know, behave badly, this that Pranab Mukherjee says in his memoirs that he told them, don't speak now, all the while before Babri Masjid fell, all of you are agreeing with Nassim Rao, none of you are sticking your neck out and saying impose president's rule, why are you doing it now, right? The real question here is not the demolition of Babri Masjid, Amit. I think the mistake we make is that those secularists amongst us see the rise of the BJP, right, as ending Indian secularism and the standing of Babri Masjid as the standing of Indian secularism, but it isn't. The real question is the rise of the BJP and is there any law in India that could have prevented it? No, because it's a bottom up democratic rise. And once that rise was ordained, the demolition of Babri Masjid was preordained. Once Kalyan Singh comes to power in UP, it becomes very difficult to protect the Babri Masjid. If not then, then a few months later, if not a few months later, then a few months later, something like this could have happened. And the only thing that could have prevented that Nassim Rao didn't do, it's an error he didn't do, but he was terrified if he did it, nobody else would back him up."

So at that time, they were not baying for his blood, this canard that Nassim Rao did Babri Masjid was spread by the Congress party after Sonia ji takes control of the Congress in 1998 as a way of destroying Nassim Rao's legacy. So the story that Nassim Rao did Babri Masjid is not spread by the BJP or the opposition, spread by the Congress party. And if the Congress party is saying that their own Prime Minister did Babri Masjid, why will anyone else stand up for Nassim Rao? The catastrophe for Nassim Rao is he's a man without a constituency. You can say anything about him and get away. And the Babri Masjid is a good example. Look, I'm very critical of him in his role in the Sikh riots. But in the Babri Masjid case, he's been unfairly maligned."

So basically saying that I have set everything in place, and now it is in your hands. And so tell me a little bit about that, because this is also not very well known, in the sense that people give Vajpayee all the credit or the debit, as it were, for India actually going nuclear.

But I'm proudest that I don't think anyone else has had access to the documents and the interviews that I have had on India's nuclear program. Nobody right has had access. I can't unfortunately on the show or on the record say how I got access to it. But suffice to say that, you know, it gives you a sense on a on a minute by minute view of how India's nuclear program is done, who is in the nuclear committee, I talk about how Nassim Rao accelerated the nuclear program in 1991 onwards. He didn't just accelerate the nuclear program, he also accelerated the program for delivery of the nuclear bomb, which is both in terms of having a missile, that's where APJ Abdul Kalam comes in, as well as through planes, right. So that both of these are delivery mechanisms for the nuclear program. And Nassim Rao had brought the program to fruition by 1995. I talk about the cat and mouse game between him and his and the Americans. And look, I know this chapter is not footnoted is deliberately not footnoted. But it's the most fun chapter I had doing because there's a genuine mystery then there's a there's a thrill there in how Nassim Rao outwits the Americans. And yet, you know, is sagacious enough to not take credit by exploding the nuclear bomb so close to an election. If you had done it, you would have won, right. But for him, national interest was more important, which is why an opposition leader from the BJP Vajpayee, who we credit with testing nuclear weapons in 1998, actually said in his words that the true father of India's nuclear program was Nassim Rao. And he says this emotionally when Nassim Rao dies in 2004, saying that this is the man whom we should thank and we haven't done it. And yeah, I don't want to say more. I'd like your listeners to actually read that chapter."

Surely he'll be a national hero forever. He'll die a much loved man and so on and so forth. But instead, what happens is he dies in 2004 in Delhi, and the Congress does not want him to be cremated there. They insist that the body be taken to Hyderabad because Sonia just doesn't want him to remain a major figure to have a Samadhi in Delhi or whatever, all of that. And then eventually, he is sort of taken to Hyderabad, there's a cremation of sorts there and gradually people have paid their respects and they kind of move away. And then there is a sentence from your book where you say, that night television channels showed visuals of the half burnt body, skull still visible, lying abandoned, stray dogs were pulling at the funeral pyre, stop quote, which is an amazing heartbreaking sentence that here is a man and his skull is, you know, still visible and stray dogs are pulling at his funeral pyre.
